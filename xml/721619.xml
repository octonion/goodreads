		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Outside Soviet Russia, and following the last symphonies of Mahler, Nielsen and Sibelius, an element of obsolescence has unmistakably attached itself to the genre. One could, perhaps, be forgiven for regarding Stravinsky’s two ironic stylizations of the symphony as a fitting farewell salute. And yet the Shostakovich symphonies have, in Philip Larkin’s phrase, ‘penetrated the public mind’ to an extent that has put them on a level with Beethoven." -- Pauline Fairclough]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["This closely parallels aspects of Wassilly Kandinsky’s
own contemporary stage piece Der gelbe Klang (written about 1909 but
not published until 1912), which was once surmised to have been a direct
inﬂuence on Schoenberg’s work. It is now known, however—since the
publication of the Schoenberg-Kandinsky correspondence—that they
had conceived this idea independently of one another. ‘It is exactly the
same as what I have striven for’, wrote Schoenberg in August 1912,
having ﬁnally read Kandinsky’s text, ‘. .  . only you go still further than I
in the renunciation of any conscious thought, any conventional plot’.
Actually" -- Malcolm MacDonald]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["No subject was
more perfectly suited to the loosened formal framework and swift juxtaposition of disparate elements that marked his ‘totally chromatic’ style;
and it is generally agreed that in this Representation of (mental) Chaos
that style found its most impressive outlet. But a representation is not a
transcription. The music itself is not chaotic. There is a willed unity of
atmosphere, created through a myriad intensely visualized details, which
could only be achieved under iron control. Paradoxically, this is probably
the direct result of the spontaneity and intensity with which Schoenberg
must have been composing in order to have created the work in such a
short space of time. The monodrama possesses no clearly deﬁned
structure, ranging so freely and juxtaposing lyricism, violence, and Angstridden terror in such uncompromising combination that it attains an
effect of continuous high-pressure improvisation; yet it combines this
with a powerful sense of continuity and tragic inevitability.
That" -- Malcolm MacDonald]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The fallacy is one of the fifty fallacies that come from the modern madness for biological or bodily metaphors. It is convenient to speak of the Social Organism, just as it is convenient to speak of the British Lion. But Britain is no more an organism than Britain is a lion. The moment we begin to give a nation the unity and simplicity of an animal, we begin to think wildly. Because every man is a biped, fifty men are not a centipede. This has produced, for instance, the gaping absurdity of perpetually talking about &quot;young nations&quot; and &quot;dying nations,&quot; as if a nation had a fixed and physical span of life. Thus people will say that Spain has entered a final senility; they might as well say that Spain is losing all her teeth. Or people will say that Canada should soon produce a literature; which is like saying that Canada must soon grow a new moustache." -- G.K. Chesterton]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["In fact, had there been less discussion of the syntactical construction of
Schoenberg’s music, and more of what it says, people might more readily have noticed what an essentially positive composer he is. There is
no trace in his music of the post-Wagnerian ‘death wish’ that infected
so many of his contemporaries, and can even be traced in the music of
younger men like Berg. He explored horror and disorientation because
he believed they could not be effectively rejected and transcended until they had been fully known. ‘Clariﬁcation" -- Malcolm MacDonald]]>
