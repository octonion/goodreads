		<description>
	    <![CDATA["In a strange room you must empty yourself for sleep. And before you are emptied for sleep, what are you. And when you are emptied for sleep, you are not. And when you are filled with sleep, you never were. I don't know what I am. I don't know if I am or not. Jewel knows he is, because he does not know that he does not know whether he is or not. He cannot empty himself for sleep because he is not what he is and he is what he is not. Beyond the unlamped wall I can hear the rain shaping the wagon that is ours, the load that is no longer theirs that felled and sawed it nor yet theirs that bought it and which is not ours either, lie on our wagon though it does, since only the wind and the rain shape it only to Jewel and me, that are not asleep. And since sleep is is-not and rain and wind are &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt;, it is not. Yet the wagon &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt;, because when the wagon is &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt;, Addie Bundren will not be. And Jewel &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt;, so Addie Bundren must be. And then I must be, or I could not empty myself for sleep in a strange room. And so if I am not emptied yet, I am &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt;.

How often have I lain beneath rain on a strange roof, thinking of home." -- William Faulkner]]>

Guildenstern: No, no, no... Death is...not. Death isn't. You take my meaning. Death is the ultimate negative. Not-being. You can't not-be on a boat.
Rosencrantz: I've frequently not been on boats.
Guildenstern: No, no, no--what you've been is not on boats." -- Tom Stoppard]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["There was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified that a concern for one's safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind. Orr was crazy and could be grounded. All he had to do was ask; and as soon as he did, he would no longer be crazy and would have to fly more missions. Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn't, but if he was sane he had to fly them. If he flew them he was crazy and didn't have to; but if he didn't want to he was sane and had to. Yossarian was moved very deeply by the absolute simplicity of this clause of Catch-22 and let out a respectful whistle.

&quot;That's some catch, that Catch-22,&quot; he observed.

&quot;It's the best there is,&quot; Doc Daneeka agreed." -- Joseph Heller]]>

Yossarian knew what he meant.

That's not what I meant,' Doc Daneeka said, as Yossarian began scratching his back." -- Joseph Heller]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Who's they?&quot; He wanted to know. &quot;Who, specifically, do you think is trying to murder you?&quot;
&quot;Every one of them,&quot; Yossarian told him.
&quot;Every one of whom?&quot;
&quot;Every one of whom do you think?&quot;
&quot;I haven't any idea.&quot;
&quot;Then how do you know they aren't?&quot;
&quot;Because...&quot; Clevinger sputtered, and turned speechless with frustration.
 	Clevinger really thought he was right, but Yossarian had proof, because strangers he didn't know shot at him with cannons every time he flew up into the air to drop bombs on them, and it wasn't funny at all." -- Joseph Heller]]>
