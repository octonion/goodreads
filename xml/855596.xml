...Jess and Pete thought alike -- like city boys, my father would have said, looking for the payoff in a situation rather than the pitfall.  Rose and Ty and I played like farmers, looking for pitfalls, holes, drop-offs, something small that will tip the tractor, break it, eat into your time, your crop, the profits that already exist in your mind, and not only as a result of crop projections and long-range forecasts, but also as an ideal that has never been attained, but could be this year." -- Jane Smiley]]>

	    <![CDATA["Nothing could quiet a happy crowd of kids like Mr. Holgren's unannounced appearance -- he loved superintending; he was made for it.  So when he marched in that morning with a determined look on his face, we froze.  Boys and girls recognize sinister as handily as dogs do.  Here it was. My best guess now is he'd got it in his head to try &quot;relating&quot; to us -- but when he produced a paper pilgrim's hat from behind his back and put it on his own head, I think we all nearly bolted." -- Leif Enger]]>

	    <![CDATA["There are random moments - tossing a salad, coming up the driveway to the house, ironing the seams flat on a quilt square, standing at the kitchen window and looking out at the delphiniums, hearing a burst of laughter from one of my children's rooms - when I feel a wavelike rush of joy. This is my true religion: arbitrary moments of of nearly painful happiness for a life I feel privileged to lead." -- Elizabeth Berg]]>
