		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Sometimes I think illness sits inside every woman, waiting for the right moment to bloom.  I have known so many sick women all my life.  Women with chronic pain, with ever-gestating diseases.  Women with conditions.  Men, sure, they have bone snaps, they have backaches, they have a surgery or two, yank out a tonsil, insert a shiny plastic hip.  Women get consumed." -- Gillian Flynn]]>

I can feel a better version of me somewhere in there - hidden behind a liver or attached to a bit of spleen within my stunted, childish body - a Libby that's telling me to get up, do something, grow up, move on.  But the meanness usually wins out. (2)" -- Gillian Flynn]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Secrets have power. And that power diminishes when they are shared, so they are best kept and kept well. Sharing secrets, real secrets, important ones, with even one other person, will change them. Writing them down is worse, because who can tell how many eyes might see them inscribed on paper, no matter how careful you might be with it. So it's really best to keep your secrets when you have them, for their own good, as well as yours." -- Erin Morgenstern]]>
