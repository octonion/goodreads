	    <![CDATA["That perhaps is your task--to find the relation between things that seem incompatible yet have a mysterious affinity, to absorb every experience that comes your way fearlessly and saturate it completely so that your poem is a whole, not a fragment; to re-think human life into poetry and so give us tragedy again and comedy by means of characters not spun out at length in the novelist's way, but condensed and synthesized in the poet's way--that is what we look to you to do now." -- Virginia Woolf]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The book was in her lap; she had read no further. The power to change one’s life comes from a paragraph, a lone remark. The lines that penetrate us are slender, like the flukes that live in river water and enter the bodies of swimmers. She was excited, filled with strength. The polished sentences had arrived, it seemed, like so many other things, at just the right time. How can we imagine what our lives should be without the illumination of the lives of others?" -- James Salter]]>

	    <![CDATA["Of them all, it was the true love.  Of them all, it was the best.  That other sumptuous love which made one drunk, which one longed for, envied, believed in, that was not life.  It was what life was seeking; it was a suspension of life.  But to be close to a child, for whom one spent everything, whose life was protected and nourished by one's own, to have that child beside one, at peace, was the real, the deepest, the only joy." -- James Salter]]>
