		<description>
	    <![CDATA["He recognized his own fear in them, and now that he knows what it looks like he sees it everywhere — in the man who pumps gas across the street, in the teenage girls who stumble down the sidewalk, in the transvestite prostitute who steps forward and back, indecisive, at the intersection while Andres prays for the light to turn green. It is a fear that he can’t get away from, and seeing it in others doesn’t make him feel any safer." -- Natalia Sylvester]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["there was a time when this home was her domain. Sometimes she felt proud of it, sometimes she felt tied to it, but whether it was a burden or a blessing, it was hers to keep. She’d known better than anyone what this house needed; lately it’d become one of the few aspects of her life she could control. there is no corner, no ridge along the steps or crack along the wall, that she doesn’t know like her own body. the house may never have been the sanctuary she’d always dreamed of, but at least it carried no surprises. It was comfortable." -- Natalia Sylvester]]>

	    <![CDATA["the past can be nothing if she’ll let it be, if she simply lets it slip from her fingers. But then what else would she lose with it? Life is a fluid mix of all the things she’s been through, and she’s not ready to throw out the good with the bad." -- natalia sylvester]]>
