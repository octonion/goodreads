	    <![CDATA["The unknown,&quot; said Faxe's soft voice in the forest, &quot;the unforetold, the unproven, that is what life is based on. Ignorance is the ground of thought. Unproof is the ground of action. If it were proven that there is no God there would be no religion. No Handdara, no Yomesh, no hearthgods, nothing. But also if it were proven that there is a God, there would be no religion. ... Tell me, Genry, what is known? What is sure, unpredictable, inevitable -- the one certain thing you know concerning your future, and mine?&quot;

That we shall die.&quot;

Yes, There's really only one question that can be answered, Genry, and we already know the answer. ... The only thing that makes life possible is permanent, intolerable uncertainty: not knowing what comes next." -- Ursula K. Le Guin]]>

	    <![CDATA["In that high place in the darkness the two oddly sensitive human atoms held each other tightly and waited. In the mind of each was the same thought. &quot;I have come to this lonely place and here is this other,&quot; was the substance of the thing felt." -- Sherwood Anderson]]>

	    <![CDATA["Love is like a wind stirring the grass beneath trees on a black night,' he had said. 'You must not try to make love definite. It is the divine accident of life. If you try to be definite and sure about it and to live beneath the trees, where soft night winds blow, the long hot day of disappointment comes swiftly and the gritty dust from passing wagons gathers upon lips inflamed and made tender by kisses." -- Sherwood Anderson]]>
