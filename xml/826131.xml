	    <![CDATA["He had never thought of himself as much of a praying man, but as he sat in the car in the growing darkness and the minutes passed, he knew what it was to pray.  It was to will goodness out of evil, hope out of despair, life out of death.  It was to will dreams into existence and spectres into reality.  It was to will an end to anguish and a beginning to joy." -- Elizabeth  George]]>

	    <![CDATA["One summer morning at sunrise a long time ago
I met a little girl with a book under her arm.
I asked her why she was out so early and
she answered that there were too many books and
far too little time.  And there she was absolutely right." -- Tove Jansson]]>
