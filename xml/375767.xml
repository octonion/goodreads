	    <![CDATA["Don't you love being alive?&quot; asked Miranda. &quot;Don't you love weather and the colors at different times of the day, and all the sounds and noises like children screaming in the next lot, and automobile horns and little bands playing in the street and the smell of food cooking?&quot;
&quot;I love to swim, too.&quot; said Adam.
&quot;So do I,&quot; said Miranda, &quot;we never did swim together." -- Katherine Anne Porter]]>

	    <![CDATA["If I'm afraid of someone on the street, I'll turn to him (it's always a boy) and say, &quot;Excuse me, do you happen to know what time it is?&quot; This is my way of saying to the person, &quot;I see you as a friend, and there is no need to hurt me or take my stuff. Also, I don't even have a watch and I am probably not worth mugging.&quot; So far, it's worked like gangbusters... And I've discovered that most people I'm afraid of are actually very friendly." -- Rebecca Stead]]>

	    <![CDATA["I can't sit still and see another man slaving and working. I want to get up and superintend, and walk round with my hands in my pockets, and tell him what to do. It is my energetic nature. I can't help it." -- Jerome K. Jerome]]>

	    <![CDATA["Also, I was coming up on my five year anniversary of owning the house, and if there's anything I've learned in five years, it's this: if a piece of your house falls off and you don't know what to do with it, throwing it in the trash and forgetting about it is a perfectly viable option." -- Meghan Daum]]>
