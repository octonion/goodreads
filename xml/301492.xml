	    <![CDATA["We have only one story. All novels, all poetry, are built on the neverending contest in ourselves of good and evil. And it occurs to me that evil must constantly respawn, while good, while virtue, is immortal. Vice has always a new fresh young face, while virtue is venerable as nothing else in the world is." -- John Steinbeck]]>

	    <![CDATA["And so seated next to my father in the train compartment, I suddenly asked, &quot;Father, what is sexsin?&quot;
He turned to look at me, as he always did when answering a question, but to my surprise he said nothing.  At last he stood up, lifted his traveling case off the floor and set it on the floor.
Will you carry it off the train, Corrie?&quot; he said.
I stood up and tugged at it.  It was crammed with the watches and spare parts he had purchased that morning.
It's too heavy,&quot; I said.
Yes,&quot; he said, &quot;and it would be a pretty poor father who would ask his little girl to carry such a load.  It's the same way, Corrie, with knowledge.  Some knowledge is too heavy for children.  When you are older and stronger, you can bear it.  For now you must trust me to carry it for you." -- Corrie Ten Boom]]>

	    <![CDATA["Others imply that they know what it is like to be depressed because they have gone through a divorce, lost a job, or broken up with someone. But these experiences carry with them feelings. Depression, instead, is flat, hollow, and unendurable. It is also tiresome. People cannot abide being around you when you are depressed. They might think that they ought to, and they might even try, but you know and they know that you are tedious beyond belief: you are irritable and paranoid and humorless and lifeless and critical and demanding and no reassurance is ever enough. You're frightened, and you're frightening, and you're &quot;not at all like yourself but will be soon,&quot; but you know you won't." -- Kay Redfield Jamison]]>
