	    <![CDATA["Since he knew things at the beginning, maybe at the end he knew things too.  That we had gone as far as chance would take us.  That nothing is more sacred than youth or more hopeful than turning yourself over to someone and saying ~ I have this time, it is not a long time, but it is my best time and my best gift, and I give it to you.  When I revisit my youth, I re-visit you." -- Hilary Thayer Hamann]]>

	    <![CDATA["It's better to keep grief inside. Grief inside works like bees or ants, building curious and perfect structures, complicating you. Grief outside means you want something from someone, and chances are good you won't get it." -- Hilary Thayer Hamann]]>
