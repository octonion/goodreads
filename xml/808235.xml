	    <![CDATA["What was that?&quot; Belgarath asked, coming back around the corner.
&quot;Brill,&quot; Silk replied blandly, pulling his Murgo robe back on.
&quot;Again?&quot; Belgarath demanded with exasperation. &quot;What was he doing this time?&quot;
&quot;Trying to fly, last time I saw him.&quot; Silk smirked.
The old man looked puzzled.
&quot;He wasn't doing it very well,&quot; Silk added.
Belgarath shrugged. &quot;Maybe it'll come to him in time.&quot;
&quot;He doesn't really have all that much time.&quot; Silk glanced out over the edge.
&quot;From far below - terribly far below - there came a faint, muffled crash; then, after several seconds, another.  &quot;Does bouncing count?&quot; Silk asked.
Belgarath made a wry face. &quot;Not really.&quot;
&quot;Then I'd say he didn't learn in time.&quot; Silk said blithely." -- David Eddings]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I tell you, life is extraordinary. A few years ago I couldn’t write anything or sell anything, I’d passed the age where you know all the returns are in, I’d had my chance and done my best and failed. And how was I to know the miracle waiting to happen round the corner in late middle age? 84, Charing Cross Road was no best seller, you understand; it didn’t make me rich or famous. It just got me hundreds of letters and phone calls from people I never knew existed; it got me wonderful reviews; it restored a self-confidence and self-esteem I’d lost somewhere along the way, God knows how many years ago. It brought me to England. It changed my life." -- Helene Hanff]]>
