		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The genes supply the motivation for warfare, [E. O.] Wilson is saying, in humans as they do in chimps, but people, blessed with the power of language, look for some objective cause of war.  A society psychs itself up to go to war by agreeing that their neighbors have wronged them, whether by seizing property or failing to deliver on some promise.  Religious leaders confirm that the local deity favors their cause and off go the troops.  " -- Nicholas Wade]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Everyone knew that Jim's creative coup d'etat came from a suggestion from his great-uncle Max, who lived on a farm in Iowa.  According to Jim [Jackers], his uncle had Mexicans running the farm while his days were spent in the farmhouse basement reconstructing a real train car from scratch, which was the only thing he had shown any interest in since the passing of his wife.  He traveled to old train yards collecting the parts.  When someone asked him at a family function why we was doing it, his answer was so that no one could remove the train car from the basement after he died.  When it was pointed out to him that the boxcar could be removed by dismantling it, reversing the process by which he had constructed it, Jim's great uncle replied that no Jackers alive was willing to work that hard at anything.

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["After years of watching their patrimony squandered in this way, a large percentage of the [Niger] Delta's population feels abandoned by both national and local politicians, and has settled on illegal bunkering as the most direct way to ensure that they benefit from their own oil wealth.  The trouble is that what started as activism has become an industry.  In the words of one activist, 'It is becoming increasingly difficult to separate greed from grievance." -- John Ghazvinian]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The most basic barrier was language itself, very few Americans in Iraq whether soldiers or diplomats or news paper reporters could speak more than a few words of Arabic.  A remarkable number of them didn't even have translators.  That meant for many Iraqis the typical 19 year old army corporal from South Dakota was not a youthful innocent carrying Americas good will, he was a terrifying combination of firepower and ignorance." -- Dexter Filkins]]>
