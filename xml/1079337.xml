	    <![CDATA["Evan Handler is not only a fine actor, he’s a damn good writer. It’s Only Temporary is wise and funny and as righteously indignant as it is endearingly self-effacing. In what may be a literary first, the book actually left me wanting more." -- Meghan Daum]]>

	    <![CDATA["Evan Handler is a man who’s looked into the abyss and laughed. His book, It’s Only Temporary, made me laugh along with him. He covers love, lust, showbiz, triumph, and despair – and he manages to be both funny and inspiring about all of it. It’s an important book that I think can help to spread goodness around the world. Something we desperately need." -- Lance Armstrong]]>

	    <![CDATA["In a series of wonderful essays, Evan Handler gives himself up to us - warts and all.  To our amusement and bemusement we share in his emotional growth as he struggles to mature.  I not only laughed along with him but felt that I too had grown a little along the way.  Who could ask for more?" -- Lewis Black]]>
