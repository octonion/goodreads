	    <![CDATA["If by a &quot;Liberal&quot; they mean someone who looks ahead and not behind, someone who welcomes new ideas without rigid reactions, someone who cares about the welfare of the people-their health, their housing, their schools, their jobs, their civil rights and their civil liberties-someone who believes we can break through the stalemate and suspicions that grip us in our policies abroad, if that is what they mean by a &quot;Liberal&quot;, then I'm proud to say I'm a &quot;Liberal." -- John F. Kennedy]]>
