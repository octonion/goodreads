	    <![CDATA["Poor fellow! I think he is in love with you.'

I am not aware of it. And to me it is one of the most odious things in a girl's life, that there must always be some supposition of falling in love coming between her and any man who is kind to her... I have no ground for the nonsensical vanity of fancying everybody who comes near me is in love with me." -- George Eliot]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["For in the multitude of middle-aged men who go about their vocations in a daily course determined for them much in the same way as the tie of their cravats, there is always a good number who once meant to shape their own deeds and alter the world a little. The story of their coming to be shapen after the average and fit to be packed by the gross, is hardly ever told even in their consciousness; for perhaps their ardour in generous unpaid toil cooled as imperceptibly as the ardour of other youthful loves, till one day their earlier self walked like a ghost in its old home and made the new furniture ghastly." -- George Eliot]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["It would be mortifying to the feelings of many ladies, could they be made to understand how little the heart of a man is affected by what is costly or new in their attire...  Woman is fine for her own satisfaction alone.  No man will admire her the more, no woman will like her the better for it.  Neatness and fashion are enough for the former, and a something of shabbiness or impropriety will be most endearing to the latter." -- Jane Austen]]>

	    <![CDATA["Do not look on [her] appearance or on the height of [her] stature, because I have rejected [her]; for the Lord does not see as mortals see; they look on the outward appearance, but the Lord looks on the heart.
--1 Samuel 16:7" -- Anonymous]]>
