and then whistle with joy,
ambling over rocks and clods of earth,
with no task but to live,
with no family but the road." -- Pablo Neruda]]>

	    <![CDATA["I had no interests. I had no interest in anything. I had no idea how I was going to escape. At least the others had some taste for life. They seemed to understand something that I didn’t understand. Maybe I was lacking. It was possible. I often felt inferior. I just wanted to get away from them. But there was no place to go. Suicide? Jesus Christ, just more work. I felt like sleeping for five years but they wouldn’t let me." -- Charles Bukowski]]>

Drunk as they were they could immediately detect any false gesture, any false word. You could never underestimate an audience. They had paid to get in; they had paid for drinks; they intended to get something and if you didn't give it to them they'd run you right into the ocean." -- Charles Bukowski]]>
