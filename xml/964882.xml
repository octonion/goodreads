	    <![CDATA["We’re in such a hurry most of the time we never get much chance to talk.  The result is a kind of endless day-to-day shallowness, a monotony that leaves a person wondering years later where all the time went and sorry that it’s all gone.  " -- Robert M. Pirsig]]>

	    <![CDATA["The test of the machine is the satisfaction it gives you.  There isn't any other test.  If the machine produces tranquility it's right.  If it disturbs you it's wrong until either the machine or your mind is changed." -- Robert M. Pirsig]]>

	    <![CDATA["The Buddha, the Godhead, resides quite as comfortably in the circuits of a digital computer or the gears of a cycle transmission as he does at the top of the mountain, or in the petals of a flower. To think otherwise is to demean the Buddha - which is to demean oneself." -- Robert M. Pirsig]]>

	    <![CDATA["She recalled him as a forceful and witty speaker with a ready repartee and a penetrating voice. He had once, for example, put down a spokesman for the pesticide industry with a remark that people still quoted at parties: &quot;And I presume on the eighth day God called you and said, 'I changed my mind about insects!" -- John Brunner]]>
