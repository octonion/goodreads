		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I have dwelt ever in realms apart from the visible world; spending my youth and adolescence in ancient and little-known books, and in roaming the fields and groves of the region near my ancestral home. I do not think that what I read in these books or saw in these fields and groves was exactly what other boys read and saw there; but of this I must say little, since detailed speech would but confirm those cruel slanders upon my intellect which I sometimes overhear from the whispers of the stealthy attendants around me." -- H.P. Lovecraft]]>

	    <![CDATA["When his life was ruined, his family killed, his farm destroyed, Job knelt down on the ground and yelled up to the heavens, &quot;Why god? Why me?&quot; and the thundering voice of God answered, There's just something about you that pisses me off." -- Stephen King]]>

	    <![CDATA["I dreamed I spoke in another's language,
I dreamed I lived in another's skin,
I dreamed I was my own beloved,
I dreamed I was a tiger's kin.

I dreamed that Eden lived inside me,
And when I breathed a garden came,
I dreamed I knew all of Creation,
I dreamed I knew the Creator's name.

I dreamed--and this dream was the finest--
That all I dreamed was real and true,
And we would live in joy forever,
You in me, and me in you." -- Clive Barker]]>
