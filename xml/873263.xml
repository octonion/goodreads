	    <![CDATA["When love beckons to you, follow him,
Though his ways are hard and steep.
And When his wings enfold you yield to him,
Though the sword hidden among his pinions may wound you.
And When he speaks to you believe in him,
Though his voice may shatter your dreams as the north wind lays waste the garden...

But if in your fear you would seek only love’s peace and love’s pleasure,
Then it is better for you that you cover your nakedness and pass out of
love’s threshing-floor,
Into the seasonless world where you shall laugh, but not all of your laughter, 
and weep, but not all of your tears...

But if you love and must needs have desires, let these be your desires:
To melt and be like a running brook that sings its melody to the night.
To know the pain of too much tenderness.
To be wounded by your own understanding of love;
And to bleed willingly and joyfully." -- Kahlil Gibran]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["speak quietly to yourself &amp; promise there will be better days.  whisper gently to yourself and provide assurance that you really are extending your best effort.  console your bruised and tender spirit with reminders of many other successes.  offer comfort in practical and tangible ways - as if you were encouraging your dearest friend.  recognize that on certain days the greatest grace is that the day is over and you get to close your eyes.  tomorrow comes more brightly..." -- mary anne radmacher]]>
