	    <![CDATA["Love is the wanting, and the having, and the choosing, and the becoming.  Love is the desire to see the person we love be and become all he or she is capable of being and becoming.  Love is a willingness to lay down our own personal plans, desires, and agenda for the good of the relationship.  Love is delayed gratification, pleasure, and pain.  Love is being able to live and thrive apart, but choosing to be together." -- Matthew Kelly]]>
