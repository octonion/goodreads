	    <![CDATA["In a universe where all values have been shattered, where religions and histories and literatures and social structures have lost their meaning, man has to stand up again, accept his condition, accept that he is alone, and has no protection, and proceed to create his own world, his own values, his own decisions, his own actions—and be willing to pay the consequences, to be responsible for everything he thinks says, and does." -- Jud Newborn &amp; Annette Dumbach]]>

	    <![CDATA["The opposite of love is not hate, it's indifference. The opposite of art is not ugliness, it's indifference. The opposite of faith is not heresy, it's indifference. And the opposite of life is not death, it's indifference." -- Elie Wiesel]]>

	    <![CDATA["But who can remember pain, once it’s over?  All that remains of it is a shadow, not in the mind even, in the flesh.  Pain marks you, but too deep to see.  Out of sight, out of mind." -- Margaret Atwood]]>
