		<description>
	    <![CDATA["This is what rituals are for.  We do spiritual ceremonies as human beings in order to create a safe resting place for our most complicated feelings of joy or trauma, so that we don't have to haul those feelings around with us forever, weighing us down.  We all need such places of ritual safekeeping.  And I do believe that if your culture or tradition doesn't have the specific ritual you are craving, then you are absolutely permitted to make up a ceremony of your own devising, fixing your own broken-down emotional systems with all the do-it-yourself resourcefulness of a generous plumber/poet." -- Elizabeth Gilbert]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Imagine that the universe is a great spinning engine.  You want to stay near the core of the thing - right in the hub of the wheel - not out at the edges where all the wild whirling takes place, where you can get frayed and crazy.  The hub of calmness - that's your heart.  That's where God lives within you.  So stop looking for answers in the world.  Just keep coming back to that center and you'll always find peace." -- Elizabeth Gilbert]]>

Like I was that good." -- Barbara Kingsolver]]>
