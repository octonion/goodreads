		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["A true war story is never moral. It does not instruct, nor encourage virtue, nor suggest models of proper human behavior, nor restrain men from doing the things men have always done. If a story seems moral, do not believe it. If at the end of a war story you feel uplifted, or if you feel that some small bit of rectitude has been salvaged from the larger waste, then you have been made the victim of a very old and terrible lie. There is no rectitude whatsoever. There is no virtue. As a first rule of thumb, therefore, you can tell a true war story by its absolute and uncompromising allegiance to obscenity and evil. " -- Tim O'Brien]]>

	    <![CDATA["He had said, &quot;I am a man,&quot; and that meant certain things to Juana.  It meant that he was half insane and half god.  It meant that Kino would drive his strength against a mountain and plunge his strength against the sea.  Juana, in her woman's soul, knew that the mountain would stand while the man broke himself; that the sea would surge while the man drowned in it.  And yet it was this thing that made him a man, half insane and half god, and Juana had need of a man; she could not live without a man." -- John Steinbeck]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Ships at a distance have every man's wish on board. For some they come in with the tide. For others they sail forever on the same horizon, never out of sight, never landing until the Watcher turns his eyes away in resignation, his dreams mocked to death by Time. That is the life of men. Now, women forget all those things they don't want to remember, and remember everything they don't want to forget. The dream is the truth. Then they act and do things accordingly." -- Zora Neale Hurston]]>

	    <![CDATA["I'm still agnostic.  But in the words of Elton Richards, I'm now a reverant agnostic.  Which isn't an oxymoron, I swear.  I now believe that whether or not there's a God, there is such a thing as sacredness.  Life is sacred.  The Sabbath can be a sacred day.  Prayer can be a sacred ritual.  There is something transcendent, beyond the everyday.  It's possible that humans created this sacredness ourselves, but that doesn't take away from its power or importance." -- A.J. Jacobs]]>

How can they meet us face to face till we have faces?" -- C.S. Lewis]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["There is a legend about a bird which sings just once in its life, more sweetly than any other creature on the face of the earth. From the moment it leaves the nest it searches for a thorn tree, and does not rest until it has found one. Then, singing among the savage branches, it impales itself upon the longest, sharpest spine. And, dying, it rises above its own agony to outcarol the lark and the nightingale. One superlative song, existence the price. But the whole world stills to listen, and God in His heaven smiles. For the best is only bought at the cost of great painâ€¦ Or so says the legend." -- Colleen McCullough]]>
