		<description>
	    <![CDATA["In the garden, the Captain of the Guard stared up at the young woman's balcony, watching as she waltzed alone, lost in her dreams. But he knew her thoughts weren't of him.

She stopped and stared upward. Even from a distance, he could see the blush upon her cheeks. She seemed young—no, new. It made his chest ache. 

Still, he watched, watched until she sighed and went inside. She never bothered to look below." -- Sarah J. Maas]]>

	    <![CDATA["Celaena,&quot; Chaol said gently. And then she heard the scraping noise as his hand came into view, sliding across the flagstones. His fingertips stopped just at the edge of the white line.  &quot;&lt;i&gt;Celaena,&quot;&lt;/i&gt; he breathed, his voice laced with pain--and hope. This was all she had left--his outstretched hand, and the promise of hope, of something better waiting on the other side of the line." -- Sarah J. Maas]]>

Her heart beat so quickly, and yet she felt utterly calm—as if she could have stayed there forever and not minded, stayed there forever and let the world fall apart around them. She pictured his fingers, pushing against that line of chalk, reaching for her despite the barrier between them." -- Sarah J. Maas]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["You're going to keep a low profile throughout the entire competition... You're going to stay solidly in the middle, where no one will look your way, because you're not a threat, because they'll think that you'll be eliminated sooner or later, and they should focus their attention on getting rid of bigger, stronger, faster champions like Cain.

'But you're going to outlast them,' Chaol continued. 'And when they wake up the morning of the final duel and find that &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; are their opponent, and that &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; have beaten them, the look on their faces will make all of the insults and lack of attention worthwhile." -- Sarah J.

She bit her lip, tears welling in her eyes. She took both of his hands in hers and he shuddered. &quot;I will die protecting you,&quot; he says.

There was a look of dismay on her face. &quot;Just like a man of this kingdom, Finnikin. Talking of death, yours or mine, is not a good way to begin a-&quot;

Isaboe gave a small gasp when he leaned forward, his lips an inch away from hers. &quot;I will die for you,&quot; he whispered.

She cupped his face in her hands. &quot;But promise me you'll live first. Because nothing we are about to do is going to be easy and I need you by my side." -- Melina Marchetta]]>

&quot;Aldron,&quot; she said clearing her throat,&quot;if he agrees to become king, I'm going to let him kiss me.  Please don't stop him.&quot;
Aldron thought for a moment and sighed, holding up his hand.  &quot;Wait there and do not move,&quot; he ordered Finnikin, before calling out to one of the other guards who stood on the platform.  &quot;Ask Perri if he's allowed to touch her if he's agreed to be king." -- Melina Marchetta]]>

Froi shivered. He realised that the words came from Quintana the ice maiden. Realised, as he felt his face heating up, that the idea of this Quintana waiting for him with excitement spoke to parts of him he believed to be dormant. And then she winked.
'Did I do that right?' she asked.  Her smile was lopsided and he saw a glimpse of the teeth.
And Froi imagined that he would follow her to the ends of the earth." -- Melina Marchetta]]>

	    <![CDATA["I fear that I will do something to bring harm to those I love,&quot; Froi said.  &quot;So I follow their rules to ensure that I won't.&quot;
&quot;But what if you bring harm or fail to protect those you don't know?  Or don't love?  Will you care as much?&quot;

&quot;Then choose another bond. One written by yourself. Because it is what you do for strangers that counts in the end." -- Melina Marchetta]]>
