	    <![CDATA["If you have any young friends who aspire to become writers, the second greatest favor you can do them is to present them with copies of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33514.The_Elements_of_Style&quot;&gt;The Elements of Style&lt;/a&gt;. The first greatest, of course, is to shoot them now, while theyâ€™re happy." -- Dorothy Parker]]>

	    <![CDATA["To me, all creativity is magic. Ideas start out in the empty void of your head - and they end up as a material thing, like a book you can hold in your hand. That is the magical process. It's an alchemical thing. Yes, we do get the gold out of it but that's not the most important thing. It's the work itself." -- Alan Moore]]>

	    <![CDATA["No writing is wasted. Did you know that sourdough from San Francisco is leavened partly by a bacteria called lactobacillus sanfrancisensis? It is native to the soil there, and does not do well elsewhere. But any kitchen can become an ecosystem. If you bake a lot, your kitchen will become a happy home to wild yeasts, and all your bread will taste better. Even a failed loaf is not wasted. Likewise, cheese makers wash the dairy floor with whey. Tomato gardeners compost with rotten tomatoes. No writing is wasted: the words you can't put in your book can wash the floor, live in the soil, lurk around in the air. They will make the next words better." -- Erin Bow]]>
