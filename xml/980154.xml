	    <![CDATA["The fact to be remembered in considering... contact with [the] thought currents of others, is that we may decide the character of the thoughts that we shall receive by carefully observing the rule to think only along such lines as may be worthy of us, and which may tend to our betterment, strength, and advancement.  In other words, we have the power to select our mental company." -- Edward Walker]]>
