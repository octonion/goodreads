	    <![CDATA["I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by 
madness, starving hysterical naked, 
dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn 
looking for an angry fix, 
angelheaded hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly 
connection to the starry dynamo in the machinery of night, 
who poverty and tatters and hollow-eyed and high sat 
up smoking in the supernatural darkness of 
cold-water flats floating across the tops of cities 
contemplating jazz, 
who bared their brains to Heaven under the El and 
saw Mohammedan angels staggering on tenement roofs illuminated, 
who passed through universities with radiant cool eyes 
hallucinating Arkansas and Blake-light tragedy 
among the scholars of war, " -- Allen Ginsberg]]>

The ceremony of innocence is drowned;
The best lack all conviction, while the worst
Are full of passionate intensity." -- William Butler Yeats]]>

	    <![CDATA["Saying It To Keep It From Happening” 


Some departure from the norm
Will occur as time grows more open about it.
The consensus gradually changed; nobody
Lies about it any more. Rust dark pouring
Over the body, changing it without decay—
People with too many things on their minds, but we live
In the interstices, between a vacant stare and the ceiling,
Our lives remind us. Finally this is consciousness
And the other livers of it get off at the same stop.
How careless. Yet in the end each of us
Is seen to have traveled the same distance—it’s time
That counts, and how deeply you have invested in it,
Crossing the street of an event, as though coming out of it 
    were
The same as making it happen. You’re not sorry,
Of course, especially if this was the way it had to happen,
Yet would like an exacter share, something about time
That only a clock can tell you: how it feels, not what it
   means.
It is a long field, and we know only the far end of it,
Not the part we presumably had to go through to get there.
If it isn’t enough, take the idea
Inherent in the day, armloads of wheat and flowers
Lying around flat on handtrucks, if maybe it means more
In pertaining to you, yet what is is what happens in the end
As though you cared. The event combined with
Beams leading up to it for the look of force adapted to the 
   wiser
Usages of age, but it’s both there
And not there, like washing or sawdust in the sunlight,
At the back of the mind, where we live now." -- John Ashbery]]>

	    <![CDATA["Myrtle


How funny your name would be
if you could follow it back to where
the first person thought of saying it,
naming himself that, or maybe
some other persons thought of it
and named that person. It would
be like following a river to its source,
which would be impossible. Rivers have no source.
They just automatically appear at a place
where they get wider, and soon a real
river comes along, with fish and debris,
regal as you please, and someone
has already given it a name: St. Benno
(saints are popular for this purpose) or, or
some other name, the name of his
long-lost girlfriend, who comes
at long last to impersonate that river,
on a stage, her voice clanking
like its bed, her clothing of sand
and pasted paper, a piece of real technology,
while all along she is thinking, I can
do what I want to do. But I want to stay here." -- John Ashbery]]>

	    <![CDATA["The Recent Past

Perhaps we ought to feel with more imagination.
As today the sky 70 degrees above zero with lines falling
The way September moves a lace curtain to be near a pear,
The oddest device can't be usual. And that is where
The pejorative sense of fear moves axles. In the stars
There is no longer any peace, emptied like a cup of coffee
Between the blinding rain that interviews.

You were my quintuplets when I decided to leave you
Opening a picture book the pictures were all of grass
Slowly the book was on fire, you the reader
Sitting with specs full of smoke exclaimed
How it was a rhyme for &quot;brick&quot; or &quot;redder.&quot;
The next chapter told all about a brook.
You were beginning to see the relation when a tidal wave
Arrived with sinking ships that spelled out &quot;Aladdin.&quot;
I thought about the Arab boy in his cave
But the thoughts came faster than advice.
If you knew that snow was a still toboggan in space
The print could rhyme with &quot;fallen star." -- John Ashbery]]>

	    <![CDATA["An Additional Poem

Where then shall hope and fear their objects find?
The harbor cold to the mating ships,
And you have lost as you stand by the balcony
With the forest of the sea calm and gray beneath.
A strong impression torn from the descending light
But night is guilty. You knew the shadow
In the trunk was raving
But as you keep growing hungry you forget.
The distant box is open. A sound of grain
Poured over the floor in some eagerness--we
Rise with the night let out of the box of wind." -- John Ashbery]]>

I have climbed this snow-stone on my face,

Breathed in deeply--arrived,

With a towel, mug of ice--fear
Among the legs of a chair, the ashman,
Purple and gray she starts upright in her chair." -- John Ashbery]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Having a Coke with You

is even more fun than going to San Sebastian, Irún, Hendaye, Biarritz, Bayonne
or being sick to my stomach on the Travesera de Gracia in Barcelona
partly because in your orange shirt you look like a better happier St. Sebastian
partly because of my love for you, partly because of your love for yoghurt
partly because of the fluorescent orange tulips around the birches
partly because of the secrecy our smiles take on before people and statuary
it is hard to believe when I’m with you that there can be anything as still
as solemn as unpleasantly definitive as statuary when right in front of it
in the warm New York 4 o’clock light we are drifting back and forth
between each other like a tree breathing through its spectacles

and the portrait show seems to have no faces in it at all, just paint
you suddenly wonder why in the world anyone ever did them

I look
at you and I would rather look at you than all the portraits in the world
except possibly for the Polish Rider occasionally and anyway it’s in the Frick
which thank heavens you haven’t gone to yet so we can go together the first time
and the fact that you move so beautifully more or less takes care of Futurism
just as at home I never think of the Nude Descending a Staircase or
at a rehearsal a single drawing of Leonardo or Michelangelo that used to wow me
and what good does all the research of the Impressionists do them
when they never got the right person to stand near the tree when the sun sank
or for that matter Marino Marini when he didn’t pick the rider as carefully
as the horse

it seems they were all cheated of some marvelous experience
which is not going to go wasted on me which is why I am telling you about it" -- Frank O'Hara]]>

	    <![CDATA["I love you as a sheriff searches for a walnut / That will solve a murder case unsolved for years / Because the murderer left it in the snow beside a window / Through which he saw her head, connecting with / Her shoulders by a neck, and laid a red /Roof in her heart. For this we lived a thousand years; / For this we love, and we live because we love, we are not /Inside a bottle, thank goodness!  

----- from &quot;To You" -- Kenneth Koch]]>

	    <![CDATA["بر اين منطقه البروج استوايي ام
 
 
اسفند امسال از هميشه طولاني تر بود 
ارديبهشت در هجوم شهاب سنگ هام  گرگ و ميش زده بود 
بر صفحات استوايي ام خاك نيمه تَرَش دارند تجزيه مي شوند 
و فرسايشم عمودي ست
و جنگل هاي باراني ام فرسايشي...
بر  عرض جغرافيايي نامعلومي كه من مي چرخم
از سطح دريا شش فرسخ فاصله دارم
و ارتفاع من از سطح آب چيزي شبيه صفر است
با اينكه برمرتفع ترين پله ايستاده ام
ماه را رويت نمي كنم
و تقويم روزِ ديگري را ورق نمي زند...
 
 (بواسطه ي جلبك ها ست كه مي شناسيدم و هواي منجمدم كه دما را حفظ مي كند...
 
شبيه گزنه اي به چسبندگي زمين وابسته ام
خرچنگ ها و اجرام آسماني از كوره ي واحدي سُريده اند
وبر اين محيط گرم طوفاني ام ذرات تجزيه مي شوند
و باران هاي سيل آساست 
و باران هاي سيل آساست....
 
بر اقيانوس منجمد شمالي ، جزيره اي ست گرمسيري كه منم
(علي رغم آن چه گفتم نيازي به محاسبه نيست!)
 محدوده اي ست كه از پيش تعيين شده است 
واما فشار سنج كار نمي كند
در امتداد اين خط گُمَم ، انگار معتدلم
و  جنگل هاي گرمسيري كه تو ساخته اي از من 
پوست تنم را تيره كرده است.
 
با كرم هاي خاكي همزيستي عجيبي پيدا كرده ام
و عصاره  ي گياهي كه  تپانده اي در حلقم." -- Rosa Jamali]]>

	    <![CDATA["شعله هاي گرمايي
 
 

نشسته بوديم سكونِ معلق هوا را يكريزبه نخ مي كشيديم
تمام ذهنم اين بود كه لايه هاي بهشت را در مغزم ذخيره كنم
وبدوزم به تكه هايي از ارديبهشت شخصي ام .

گفتي از پانصد سال پيش با هم بوده ايم
واز روزي كه به دنيا آمده ام بر آن درخت وحشي نقر شده ايم
و قابمان گرفته اند 
هر دو
و با پيراهن هايي از ما كه منتشر شده است در زماني كه افليج مان كرده است از اضطراب 
هيولايي از تپشِ قلب
جداره هاي من را از زمين بي واسطه كنده است
و به تو وصلم كرده است." -- Rosa Jamali]]>
