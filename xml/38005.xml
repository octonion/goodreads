	    <![CDATA["There was a clatter as the basilisk fangs cascaded out of Hermione's arms. Running at Ron, she flung them around his neck and kissed him full on the mouth. Ron threw away the fangs and broomstick he was holding and responded with such enthusiasm that he lifted Hermione off her feet. 
&quot;Is this the moment?&quot; Harry asked weakly, and when nothing happened except that Ron and Hermione gripped each other still more firmly and swayed on the spot, he raised his voice. &quot;OI! There's a war going on here!&quot; 
Ron and Hermione broke apart, their arms still around each other. 
&quot;I know, mate,&quot; said Ron, who looked as though he had recently been hit on the back of the head with a Bludger, &quot;so it's now or never, isn't it?&quot; 
&quot;Never mind that, what about the Horcrux?&quot; Harry shouted. &quot;D'you think you could just --- just hold it in, until we've got the diadem?&quot; 
&quot;Yeah --- right --- sorry ---&quot; said Ron, and he and Hermione set about gathering up fangs, both pink in the face." -- J.K. Rowling]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Its so hard to talk when you want to kill yourself. That's above and beyond everything else, and it's not a mental complaint-it's a physical thing, like it's physically hard to open your mouth and make the words come out. They don't come out smooth and in conjunction with your brain the way normal people's words do; they come out in chunks as if from a crushed-ice dispenser; you stumble on them as they gather behind your lower lip. So you just keep quiet." -- Ned Vizzini]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I know you adore Father, but he isn't the white knight you imagine him to be. He never was. True, he's charming and loving in his way. But he's selfish. He's a limited man determined to bring about his own end-&quot;
&quot;But-&quot;
Tom grabs both my hands in his and gives them a small squeeze. &quot;Gemma, you can't save him. Why can't you accept that?&quot;
I see my reflection on the surface of the Thames. My face is a watery outline, all blurred edges with nothing settled. 
&quot;Because if I let go of that&quot; - I swallow hard, once, twice - &quot;then I have to accept that I am alone.&quot;
The ship's horn howls again as it slips out toward sea. Tom's reflection appears beside mine, just as uncertain.
&quot;We're every one of us alone in this world, Gemma.&quot; He doesn't say it bitterly. &quot;But you have company, if you want." -- Libba Bray]]>

&quot;If the world will not forgive me,&quot; I say softly, &quot;I shall have to learn to forgive myself.&quot;
He nods in understanding.

I think of Kartik, and tears threaten. &quot;I shall meet someone one day, as Mother found you." -- Libba Bray]]>

	    <![CDATA["No one should be ashamed to speak up. Shame makes it easy for neglect and abuse and bullying to stay huddled together in their dark corner.

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Islam and Christianity promise eternal paradise to the faithful. And that is a powerful opiate, certainly, the hope of a better life to come. But there's a Sufi story that challenges the notion that people believe only because they need an opiate. Rabe'a al-Adiwiyah, a great woman saint of Sufism, was seem running through the streets of her hometown, Basra, carrying a torch in one hand and a bucket of water in the other. When someone asked her what she was doing, she answered, 'I am going to take this bucket of water and pour it on the flames of hell, and then I am going to use this torch to burn down the gates of paradise so that people will not love God for want of heaven of fear of hell, but because He is God." -- John Green]]>
