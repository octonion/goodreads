	    <![CDATA["I deal with people like him a hundred times a day. They look at me and naturally assume I'm not as smart as they are. God help us. But think about it, it's a tremendous tactical advantage, not to mention personally liberating, to haveothers think I'm a dummy." -- Francisco X. Stork]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Books can be possessive, can't they? You're walking around in a bookstore and a certain one will jump out at you, like it had moved there on its own, just to get your attention. Sometimes what's inside will change your life, but sometimes you don't even have to read it. Sometimes it's a comfort just to have a book around.  Many of these books haven't even had their spines cracked.  'Why do you buy books you don't even read?' our daughter asks us.  That's like asking someone who lives alone why they bought a cat.  For company, of course." -- Sarah Addison Allen]]>

	    <![CDATA["It was the best first kiss in the history of first kisses.  It was as sweet as sugar.  And it was warm, as warm as pie.  The whole world opened up and I fell inside.  I don't know where I was, but I didn't care.  I didn't care because the only person who mattered was there with me." -- Sarah Addison Allen]]>

	    <![CDATA["Embarrassment felt a lot like eating chili peppers.  It burned in the back of your throat and there was nothing you could do to make it go away.  You just had to take it, suffer from it, until it eased off." -- Sarah Addison Allen]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain." -- Frank Herbert]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["There was a strange but universal understanding among women.  On some level all women knew, they all understood, the fear of being outnumbered, of being helpless.  It throbbed in their chests when they thought about the times they left stores and were followed.  The knocks on their car windows as they were sitting alone at red lights, and strangers asking for rides.  Having too much to drink and losing their ability to be forceful enough to just say no.  Smiling at strange men coming on to them, not wanting to hurt their feelings, not wanting to make a scene.  All women remembered these things, even if they had never happened to them personally.  It was a part of their collective unconscious." -- Sarah Addison Allen]]>
