		<description>
	    <![CDATA["It had seemed like the beginning of happiness, and Clarissa is still sometimes shocked, more than thirty years later to realize that it was happiness; that the entire experience lay in a kiss and a walk. The anticipation of dinner and a book. The dinner is by now forgotten; Lessing has been long overshadowed by other writers. What lives undimmed in Clarissa's mind more than three decades later is a kiss at dusk on a patch of dead grass, and a walk around a pond as mosquitoes droned in the darkening air. There is still that singular perfection, and its perfect in part because it seemed, at the time, so clearly to promise more. Now she knows: That was the moment, right then. There has been no other." -- Michael Cunningham]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["For we live with those retrievals from childhood that coalesce and echo throughout our lives, the way shattered pieces of glass in a kaleidoscope reappear in new forms and are songlike in their refrains and rhymes, making up a single monologue. We live permanently in the recurrence of our own stories, whatever story we tell." -- Michael Ondaatje]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Few pleasures, for the true reader, rival the pleasure of browsing unhurriedly among books: old books, new books, library books, other people's books, one's own books - it does not matter whose or where. Simply to be among books, glancing at one here, reading a page from one over there, enjoying them all as objects to be touched, looked at, even smelt, is a deep satisfaction. And often, very often, while browsing haphazardly, looking for nothing in particular, you pick up a volume that suddenly excites you, and you know that this one of all the others you must read. Those are great moments - and the books we come across like that are often the most memorable." -- Aidan Chambers]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["...and at the table next to her was a little boy in a soccer uniform sitting with his mother who told him, &lt;i&gt;The plural of elf is elves.&lt;/i&gt; A wave of happiness came over me. It felt giddy to be part of it all. To be drinking a cup of coffee like a normal person. I wanted to shout out: &lt;i&gt;The plural of elf is elves! What a language! What a world!&lt;/i&gt;" -- Nicole Krauss]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Here and gone. That’s what it is to be human, I think—to be both someone and no one at once, to hold a particular identity in the world (our names, our place of origins, our family and affectional ties) and to feel that solid set of ties also capable of dissolution, slipping away, as we become moments of attention." -- Mark Doty]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["And now, a heap of roses
beside the sea, white rugosa
beside the foaming hem of shore:
                               brave,

waxen candles…
                      And we talk
as if death were a line to be crossed.
Look at them, the white roses.
Tell me where they end." -- Mark Doty]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Connecting in sips may work for gathering discreet bits of information, they may work for saying, &quot;I'm thinking about you,&quot; or even for saying, &quot;I love you,&quot; but they don't really work for learning about each other, for really coming to know and understand each other. And we use conversations with each other to learn how to have conversations with ourselves. So a flight from conversation can really matter because it can compromise our capacity for self-reflection. For kids growing up, that skill is the bedrock of development." -- Sherry Turkle]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["When Thoreau considered &quot;where I live and what I live for,&quot; he tied together location and values. Where we live doesn't just change how we live; it informs who we become. Most recently, technology promises us lives on the screen. What values, Thoreau would ask, follow from this new location? Immersed in simulation, where do we live, and what do we live for?" -- Sherry Turkle]]>
