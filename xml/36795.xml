His face appeared so serene, so intelligent, as if he truly understood the situation. I almost wanted him to turn to me and say, 'This is the turning point of the war! We've finally stopped them! We're finally safe!' But instead his little penis popped out and he peed in my face." -- Max Brooks]]>

And we know that time has wings, 
So we're the ones who have to fly." -- Neil Peart]]>
