	    <![CDATA["Have you kissed many boys before?&quot; he asked quietly.
 His question brought my mind back into focus.  I raised an eyebrow.  &quot;Boys? That's an assumption.&quot;
 Noah laughed, the sound low and husky.  &quot;Girls, then?&quot;
&quot;No.&quot;
&quot;Not many girls? Or not many boys?&quot;
&quot;Neither,&quot; I said.  Let him make of that what he would.
&quot;How many?&quot;
 &quot;Whyâ€”&quot;
 &quot;I am taking away that word.  You are no longer allowed to use it.  How many?&quot;
 My cheeks flushed, but my voice was steady as I answered.  &quot;One.&quot;
 At this, Noah leaned in impossibly closer, the slender muscles in his forearm flexing as he bent his elbow to bring himself nearer to me, almost touching.  I was heady with the proximity of him and grew legitimately concerned that my heart might explode.  Maybe Noah wasn't asking.  Maybe I didn't mind.  I closed my eyes and felt Noah's five o' clock graze my jaw, and the faintest whisper of his lips at my ear.
&quot;He was doing it wrong." -- Michelle Hodkin]]>

	    <![CDATA["I laughed as I twisted to face him and raised my arm to hit in one move.  He caught my wrist and my laugh caught in my throat.  A mischievous grin curved my mouth as I raised my other hand to hit him.  He reached over me and caught that wrist too, gently pinning my arms above my head as he straddled my hips.  The space between us boiled my blood." -- Michelle Hodkin]]>

And with that half-smile that wrecked me, Noah said, &quot;But you're here anyway." -- Michelle Hodkin]]>

	    <![CDATA["Wait,&quot; I said as Noah slipped a book from a shelf and headed toward the door.  &quot;Where are you going?&quot;
&quot;To read?&quot;
But I don't want you to. 
&quot;But I need to go home,&quot; I said, my eyes meeting his.  &quot;My parents are going to kill me.&quot;
&quot;Taken care of.  You're at Sophie's house.&quot;
I loved Sophie.
&quot;So I'm...staying here?&quot;
&quot;Daniel's covering for you.&quot;
I loved Daniel.
&quot;Where's Katie?&quot; I asked, trying to sound casual.
&quot;Eliza's house.&quot;
I loved Eliza.
&quot;And your parents?&quot; I asked.
&quot;Some charity thing.&quot;
I loved charity.
&quot;So why are you going to read when I'm right here?" -- Michelle Hodkin]]>
