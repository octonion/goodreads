		<description>
	    <![CDATA["...I've made it my business to observe fathers and daughters.  And I've seen some incredible, beautiful things.  Like the little girl who's not very cute - her teeth are funny, and her hair doesn't grow right, and she's got on thick glasses - but her father holds her hand and walks with her like she's a tiny angel that no one can touch.  He gives her the best gift a woman can get in this world: protection.  And the little girl learns to trust the man in her life.  And all the things that the world expects from women - to be beautiful, to soothe the troubled spirit, heal the sick, care for the dying, send the greeting card, bake the cake - allof those things become the way we pay the father back for protecting us..." -- Adriana Trigiani]]>

Every time you place a book in the hands of a child, you do the same thing.  It is very risky.  But each time a child opens a book, he pushes open the gate that separates him from Elsewhere.  It gives him choices.  It gives him freedom.  Those are magnificent, wonderfully unsafe things.
