	    <![CDATA["Ghastly,&quot; continued Marvin, &quot;it all is. Absolutely ghastly. Just don't even talk about it. Look at this door,&quot; he said, stepping through it. The irony circuits cut in to his voice modulator as he mimicked the style of the sales brochure. &quot; 'All the doors in his spaceship  have a cheerful and sunny disposition. It is their pleasure to open for you, and their satisfaction to close again with the knowledge of a job well done.' &quot;
 As the door closed behind them it became apparent that it did indeed have a satisfied sighlike quality to it. &quot;Hummmmmmmyummmmmmmah!&quot; it said." -- Douglas Adams]]>
