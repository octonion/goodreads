	    <![CDATA["You think your pain and your heartbreak are unprecedented in the history of the world, but then you read. It was books that taught me that the things that tormented me most were the very things that connected me with all the people who were alive, or who had ever been alive." -- James Baldwin]]>

	    <![CDATA["Chapter One of My Life.  I walk down the street. There's a deep hole in the sidewalk. I fall in. 
I am lost. I am helpless. It isn't my fault. It still takes forever to find a way out.

Chapter Two.  I walk down the same street. There's a deep hole in the sidewalk. I pretend I don't see it. I fall in again. I can't believe I'm in the same place! But it isn't my fault. And it still takes a long time to get out.

Chapter Three.  I walk down the same street. There's a deep hole in the sidewalk. I see it there. I still fall in. It's a habit! My eyes are open. I know where I am. It is my fault. I get out immediately.

Chapter Four.  I walk down the same street. There's a deep hole in the sidewalk. I walk around it.

Chapter Five.  I walk down a different street." -- Portia Nelson]]>
