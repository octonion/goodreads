	    <![CDATA["One hour of life, crowded to the full with glorious action, and filled with noble risks, is worth whole years of those mean observances of paltry decorum, in which men steal through existence, like sluggish waters through a marsh, without either honour or observation." -- Sir Walter Scott]]>

	    <![CDATA["I am not one of those weak-spirited, sappy Americans who want to be liked by all the people around them. I donâ€™t care if people hate my guts; I assume most of them do. The important question is whether they are in a position to do anything about it. My affections, being concentrated over a few people, are not spread all over Hell in a vile attempt to placate sulky, worthless shits." -- William S. Burroughs]]>
