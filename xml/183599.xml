		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Suddenly, all I can think about are all the things I don't know about him. All the things I never had time to learn. I don't know if his feet are ticklish or how long his toes are. I don't know what nightmares he had as a child. I don't know which stars are his favorites, what shapes he sees in the clouds. I don't know what he is truly afraid of or what memories he holds closest. 
And I don't have enough time now, never enough time. I want to be in the moment with him, feel his body against mine and think of nothing else, but my mind explodes with grief for all that I am missing. All that I will miss. All that I have wasted." -- Carrie Ryan]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["They're endless, stretching beyond the horizon and spreading around me like forever.  They heave and moan, frothing over each other, cresting and falling.  The pure depth and vastness of it all beyond comprehension, my eyes unable to focus on any individual.  Instead I'm drowned in their need.  They ripple and swell, the bodies of the Mudo, like the ocean.  Like the dead-tossed waves." -- Carrie Ryan]]>
