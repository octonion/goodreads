A light from the shadows shall spring;
Renewed shall be blade that was broken,
The crownless again shall be king." -- J.R.R. Tolkien]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Good Morning!&quot; said Bilbo, and he meant it. The sun was shining, and the grass was very green. But Gandalf looked at him from under long bushy eyebrows that stuck out further than the brim of his shady hat.

&quot;What do you mean?&quot; he said. &quot;Do you wish me a good morning, or mean that it is a good morning whether I want it or not; or that you feel good this morning; or that it is a morning to be good on?&quot;

&quot;All of them at once,&quot; said Bilbo. &quot;And a very fine morning for a pipe of tobacco out of doors, into the bargain.

...

&quot;Good morning!&quot; he said at last. &quot;We don't want any adventures here, thank you! You might try over The Hill or across The Water.&quot; By this he meant that the conversation was at an end.
&quot;What a lot of things you do use Good morning for!&quot; said Gandalf. &quot;Now you mean that you want to get rid of me, and that it won't be good till I move off." -- J.R.R. Tolkien]]>

There are adventures of the spirit and one can travel in books and interest oneself in people and affairs. One need ever be dull as long as one has friends to help, gardens to enjoy and books in the long winter evenings." -- Dorothy Emily Stevenson]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Because children have abounding vitality, because they are in spirit fierce and free, therefore they want things repeated and unchanged. They always say, &quot;Do it again&quot;; and the grown-up person does it again until he is nearly dead. For grown-up people are not strong enough to exult in monotony. But perhaps God is strong enough to exult in monotony. It is possible that God says every morning, &quot;Do it again&quot; to the sun; and every evening, &quot;Do it again&quot; to the moon. It may not be automatic necessity that makes all daisies alike; it may be that God makes every daisy separately, but has never got tired of making them. It may be that He has the eternal appetite of infancy; for we have sinned and grown old, and our Father is younger than we." -- G. K. Chesterton]]>
