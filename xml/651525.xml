		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I think we ought to read only the kind of books that wound or stab us. If the book we're reading doesn't wake us up with a blow to the head, what are we reading for? So that it will make us happy, as you write? Good Lord, we would be happy precisely if we had no books, and the kind of books that make us happy are the kind we could write ourselves if we had to. But we need books that affect us like a disaster, that grieve us deeply, like the death of someone we loved more than ourselves, like being banished into forests far from everyone, like a suicide. A book must be the axe for the frozen sea within us. That is my belief." -- Franz Kafka]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The Shadow is what people are hunting throughout the tale. Or else it can dog the hero, refusing to leave him alone. It's a potent force that bewitches as much as it torments. It can lead to hell or heaven. It's the hollow forever inside you, never filled. It's everything in life you can't touch, hold on to, so ephemeral and painful it makes you gasp. You might even glimpse it for a few seconds before it's gone. Yet the image will live with you. You'll never forget it as long as you live. It's what you're terrified of and paradoxically what you're looking for. We are nothing without our shadows. They give our otherwise pale, blinding world definition. They allow us to see what's right in front of us. Yet they'll haunt us until we're dead." -- Marisha Pessl]]>

	    <![CDATA["Well, does it make sense to you?&quot;
He said, &quot;It doesn't have to, it's something that happens. It's like seeing a person you never saw before - you could be passing on the street - and you look at each other...&quot;
Karen was nodding. &quot;You make eye contact without meaning to.&quot;
&quot;And for a few moments,&quot; Foley said, &quot;there's a kind of recognition. You look at each other and you know something.&quot;
&quot;That no one else knows,&quot; Karen said. &quot;You see it in their eyes.&quot;
&quot;And the next moment the person's gone,&quot; Foley said, &quot;and it's too late to do anything about it, but you remember it because it was right there and you let it go, and you think, What if I had stopped and said something? It might happen only a few times in your life.&quot;
&quot;Or once,&quot; Karen said." -- Elmore Leonard]]>

Maybe they're always worth being scared for, and hoping for, and living for. Maybe worth dying for too, if that's what has to be.  No good friends. No bad friends. Only people you want, need to be with; people who build their houses in your heart." -- Stephen King]]>
