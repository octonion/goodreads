	    <![CDATA["The show's writers had peppered the piece with words like &quot;savage,&quot; &quot;wild,&quot; and &quot;animalistic.&quot; What bullshit. Show me the animal that kills for the thrill of watching something die. Why does the stereotype of the animalistic killer persist?

Because humans like it. It neatly explains things for them, moving humans to the top of the evolutionary ladder and putting killers down among mythological man-beast monsters like werewolves.

The truth is, if a werewolf behaved like this psychopath it wouldn't be because he was part animal, but because he was still too human. Only humans kill for sport." -- Kelley Armstrong]]>

	    <![CDATA["You'll wrest a burning sword from an angel, but you're afraid of bats?&quot;
&quot;I'm not afraid of them. I just don't like them. They're...furry. Flying things shouldn't be furry. It's not right. And if I ever meet the Creator, I'm taking that one up with him.&quot;
&quot;That I'd like to see. Your one and possible only chance to get the answer to every question in the universe, and you ask, 'Why are bats furry?'&quot;
&quot;I will. You just wait." -- Kelley Armstrong]]>
