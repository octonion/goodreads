	    <![CDATA["As for her perfume, it was the kind you only noticed after she'd left a room, not while she was still in it. Even then you didn't realize it was perfume, you only wondered what had made you think of her just then." -- Cornell Woolrich]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Journalism is not a profession or a trade. It is a cheap catch-all for fuckoffs and misfits -- a false doorway to the backside of life, a filthy piss-ridden little hole nailed off by the building inspector, but just deep enough for a wino to curl up from the sidewalk and masturbate like a chimp in a zoo-cage." -- Hunter S. Thompson]]>

They sparkle still the right Promethean fire;
They are the books, the arts, the academes,
That show, contain and nourish all the world." -- Shakespeare]]>

	    <![CDATA["But it was the first time I had ever really used the place I knew and the things I felt in a piece of fiction, and there was a kind of dreadful exhiliration in seeing things that had troubled me for years come out in a new form, &lt;em&gt;a form over which I had imposed control.&lt;/em&gt;" -- Stephen King]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["So it's the unwinding of your nervous system. The corresponding experience to what winds you up comes out in your dreams. To write a song then, even one like &lt;em&gt;Don't Bother Me&lt;/em&gt;, helps to get rid of some subconscious burden. Writing a song is like going to confession." -- George Harrison]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The most important things are the hardest to say. They are the things you get ashamed of, because words diminish them -- words shrink things that seemed limitless when they were in your head to no more than living size when they're brought out. But it's more than that, isn't it? The most important things lie too close to wherever your secret heart is buried, like landmarks to a treasure your enemies would love to steal away. And you may make revelations that cost you dearly only to have people look at you in a funny way, not understanding what you've said at all, or why you thought it was so important that you almost cried while you were saying it. That's the worst, I think. When the secret stays locked within not for want of a teller but for want of an understanding ear." -- Stephen King]]>

	    <![CDATA["It is only natural that difficulties arise if we must fight day by day in order to survive while another human being, equal to us, is effortlessly living a luxurious life. This is an unhealthy situation; as a result, even the wealthy — the billionaires and millionaires — remain in constant anxiety." -- Dalai Lama XIV]]>
