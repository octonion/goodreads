	    <![CDATA["Up till then he had been looking at the Lion's great front feet and the huge claws on them; now, in his despair, he looked up at its face. What he saw surprised him as much as anything in his whole life. For the tawny face was bent down near his own and (wonder of wonders) great shining tears stood in the Lion's eyes. They were such big, bright tears compared with Digory's own that for a moment he felt as if the Lion must really be sorrier about his Mother than he was himself. &quot;My son, my son,&quot; said Aslan. &quot;I know. Grief is great. Only you and I in this land know that yet. Let us be good to one another." -- C.S. Lewis]]>
