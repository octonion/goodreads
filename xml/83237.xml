		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Peace, he knows, can be shattered in a million variations: great visions of the end, a rain of ash, a disease on the wind, a blast in the distance, the sun dying like a kerosene lamp clicked off.  And in smaller ways: an overheard remark, his daughter’s sour mood, his own body faltering.  There’s no use in anticipating the mode.  He will wait for the hushed spaces in life, for Ellis’s snore in the dark, for Grete’s stealth kiss, for the warm light inside the gallery, his images on the wall broken beyond beauty into blisters and fragments, returning in the eye to beauty again.  The voices of women at night on the street, laughing; he has always loved the voices of women.  Pay attention, he thinks.  Not to the grand gesture, but to the passing breath.
He sits.  He lets the afternoon sink in.  The sweetness of the soil rises to him.  A squirrel scolds from high in a tree.  The city is still far away, full of good people going home.  In this moment that blooms and fades as it passes, he is enough, and all is well in the world." -- Lauren Groff]]>

	    <![CDATA["Peter glances out at the falling snow. Oh, little man. You have brought down your house not through passion but by neglect. You who dared to think of yourself as dangerous. You are guilty not of the epic transgressions but the tiny crimes. You have failed in the most base and human of ways - you have not imagined the lives of others." -- Michael Cunningham]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Life will break you. Nobody can protect you from that, and living alone won't either, for solitude will also break you with its yearning. You have to love. You have to feel. It is the reason you are here on earth. You are here to risk your heart. You are here to be swallowed up. And when it happens that you are broken, or betrayed, or left, or hurt, or death brushes near, let yourself sit by an apple tree and listen to the apples falling all around you in heaps, wasting their sweetness. Tell yourself you tasted as many as you could." -- Louise Erdrich]]>

I'm in love with you, and I know that love is just a shout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that we're all doomed and that there will come a day when all our labor has been returned to dust, and I know the sun will swallow the only earth we'll ever have, and I am in love with you." -- John Green]]>
