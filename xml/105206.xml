	    <![CDATA["And of course there was Seamus, who could now come to work with me on most days. He had a bed and toys in one corner near my desk, although he preferred curling up in the guest chairs directly across from me, as though he had an appointment and urgent matters to howl about. (More fookinâ€™ food! Seriously, people. I need more foooooooooooood!!)" -- Teresa Rhyne]]>

	    <![CDATA["I don't know that I ever planned on having children, but it's one thing to decide you aren't going to do something and another thing to be told that you can't do something." -- Jay Gironimi]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["You, in turn, observe yourself from a distance, simply astonished by the quantities of love you manufacture. It is endless. Your adoration may grow weary but it will never end: it becomes the fuel of your head, your body, and your heart. It powers you through the pouring rain, delivering forgotten raincoats for lunchtime play; works overtime, paying for shoes and puppets; keeps you up all night, easing cough, fever," -- Caitlin Moran]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["While motherhood is an incredible vocation, it has no more inherent worth than a childless woman simply being who she is, to the utmost of her capabilities. To think otherwise betrays a belief that being a thinking, creative, productive, and fulfilled woman is, somehow, not enough. That no action will ever be the equal of giving birth." -- Caitlin Moran]]>
