	    <![CDATA["I find that all people are fundamentally alike. We are one human family. Perhaps we have different clothes, our skin is of a different color, or we speak various languages, but that is on the surface only. We all have dreams and seek for things that will bring true happiness. To know all the world, I just need to learn about  myself." -- Colleen Houck]]>

	    <![CDATA["If a king owned a pearl without price, a gem he cherished above all. Would he hide it away, bury it from sight afraid others would take it? Or would he display it proudly, set it in a ring or crown, so that all the world could behold its beauty and see what richness it brings to his life? You are my pearl without price." -- Colleen Houck]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The very purpose of life is to be happy. As we care for others, the greater is our own senses of well-being. It puts the mind at ease. It helps remove whatever fears or insecurities we may have and gives us the strength to cope with any obstacle we encounter. Remember that old saying &quot; love will conquer all &quot; is true. As you give love, you will find it returns to you magnified." -- Colleen Houck]]>

	    <![CDATA["You're forgetting something &lt;i&gt;iadala&lt;/i&gt;.  Love is not a consequence.  Love is not a choice.  Love is a &lt;i&gt;thirst&lt;/i&gt; --- a need as vital to the soul as water is to the body." -- Colleen Houck]]>
