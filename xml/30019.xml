Perhaps they've been trusted with some major cosmic task, an essential law of physics - such as:  if there are less than 5 million cats sleeping at any one time the world will stop spinning.  So that when you look at them and think, &quot;what a lazy, good-for-nothing animal,&quot; they are, in fact, working very, very hard." -- Kate Atkinson]]>

	    <![CDATA["I can't help but think that it's an unfortunate custom to name children after people who come to sticky ends. Even if they are fictional characters, it doesn't bode well for the poor things. There are too many Judes and Tesses and Clarissas and Cordelias around. If we must name our children after literary figures then we should search out happy ones, although it's true they are much harder to find." -- Kate Atkinson]]>
