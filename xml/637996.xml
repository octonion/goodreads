	    <![CDATA["With small nose, gross thighs, and those back-bent smoke-dyed fingers, he obliged me with this explanation, and he thought to have more effect on me than he really ever could have. When I didn't argue he was satisfied that he had persuaded me, and was not the first to make that mistake." -- Saul Bellow]]>

	    <![CDATA["I heard somebody open and shut the gate to the barn lot, but I didn't look around.  If I didn't look around it would not be true that somebody had opened the gate with the creaky hinges, and that is a wonderful principle for a man to get hold of... What you don't know know don't hurt you, for it ain't real.  They called that Idealism in my book I had when I was in college, and after I got hold of that principle I became an Idealist... If you are an Idealist it does not matter what you do or what goes on around you because it isn't real anyway." -- Robert Penn Warren]]>

	    <![CDATA["Process as process is neither morally good nor morally bad.  We may judge results but not process.  The morally bad agent may perform the deed which is good.  The morally good agent may perform the deed which is bad.  Maybe a man has to sell his soul to get the power to do good." -- Robert Penn Warren]]>
