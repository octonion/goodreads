		<description>
	    <![CDATA["There is, we are aware, a philosophy that denies the infinite.  There is also a philosophy, classified as pathologic, that denies the sun; this philosophy is called blindness.  To set up a theory that lacks a source of truth is an excellent example of blind assurance.  And the odd part of it is the haughty air of superiority and compassion assumed toward the philosophy that sees God, by this philosophy that has to grope its way.  It makes one think of a mole exclaiming, &quot;How I pity them with their sun!&quot;  There are, we know, illustrious and powerful atheists; with them, the matter is nothing but a question of definitions, and at all events, even if they do not believe in God, they prove God, because they are great minds.  We hail, in them, the philosophers, while, at the same time, inexorably disputing their philosophy." -- Victor Hugo]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The life of the cenobite is a human problem.  When we speak of convents, those seats of error but innocence, of mistaken views but good intentions, of ignorance but devotion, of torment but martyrdom, we must nearly always say yes or no...The monastery is a renunciation.  Self-sacrifice, even when misdirected, is still self-sacrifice.  To assume as duty a strict error has its peculiar grandeur." -- Victor Hugo]]>

No one can become fully aware of the very essence of another human being unless he loves him. By his love he is enabled to see the essential traits and features in the beloved person; and even more, he sees that which is potential in him, which is not yet actualized but yet ought to be actualized. Furthermore, by his love, the loving person enables the beloved person to actualize these potentialities. By making him aware of what he can be and of what he should become, he makes these potentialities come true." -- Viktor E. Frankl]]>
