		<description>
	    <![CDATA["What does Éloa mean?”

He narrowed his gaze, answered her literally. “It’s the name of an angel.”

Penelope tilted her head, thinking. “I’ve never heard of him.”

“You wouldn’t have.”

“Was he a fallen angel?”

“She was, yes.” He hesitated, not wanting to tell her the story, but unable to stop himself. “Lucifer tricked her into falling from heaven.”

“Tricked her how?”

He met her gaze. “She fell in love with him.”

Penelope’s eyes widened. “Did he love her?”

&lt;i&gt;Like an addict loves his addiction. &lt;/i&gt;“The only way he knew how.”

She shook her head. “How could he trick her?”

“He never told her his name." -- Sarah MacLean]]>

	    <![CDATA["I . . . hit him . . . elsewhere.”
“Where?”
“In his . . .In his inguine.”
“Oh, dear God.” It was unclear whether Ralston’s words were meant as prayer or blasphemy.
What was clear was that the woman was a gladiator.
“He called me a pie!” she announced, defensively. There was a pause. “Wait. That’s not right.”
“A tart?”
“Yes! That’s it!” She registered her brother’s fists and looked to Simon. “I see that it is not a compliment.”
“No. It is not." -- Sarah MacLean]]>

	    <![CDATA["How is it that one woman is…enough…for three men?”
“I don’t know.”
“She must be a very talented courtesan.”
“Callie.”
“Well, that was what she was. Wasn’t it?”
“Yes.”
“How very fascinating!” She smiled brightly. “I’ve never met a courtesan, you know.”
“I could have surmised as such.”
“She looked just as I imagined they did! Well, she was rather prettier.”
Ralston’s eyes darted around the room as though he was looking for the quickest escape route.
“Callie. Wouldn’t you rather gamble than talk about courtesans?" -- Sarah MacLean]]>

cleanse you from it. But I would not, if I could. I have never
loved any woman before: my life has been too busy, my thoughts
too much absorbed with other things. Now I love, and will love.
But do not be afraid of too much expression on my part." -- Elizabeth Gaskell]]>
