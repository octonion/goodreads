	    <![CDATA["I am looking for friends. What does that mean -- tame?&quot;

&quot;It is an act too often neglected,&quot; said the fox. &quot;It means to establish ties.&quot; 

&quot;To establish ties?&quot; 

&quot;Just that,&quot; said the fox. &quot;To me, you are still nothing more than a little boy who is just like a hundred thousand other little boys. And I have no need of you. And you, on your part, have no need of me. To you I am nothing more than a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes. But if you tame me, then we shall need each other. To me, you will be unique in all the world. To you, I shall be unique in all the world...." -- Antoine de Saint-Exupéry]]>
