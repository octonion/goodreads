	    <![CDATA["People said things they didn't mean all the time.  Everybody else in the world seemed able to factor it in.  But not Lena.  Why did she believe the things people said?  Why did she cling to them so literally?  Why did she think she knew people when she clearly didn't?  Why did she imagine that the world didn't change, when it did?  Maybe she didn't change.  She believed what people said and she stayed the same.&quot; (Lena, 211)" -- Ann Brashares]]>

	    <![CDATA["It was frustrating when people loved you and took an interest in you and sometimes worried about you and personally cared what you did with yourself.  Lena wished that love were something you could flip on and off.  You could turn it on when you felt good bout yourself and worthy of it and generous enough to return it.  You could clip it off when you needed to hide or self-destruct and had nothing at all to give.&quot; (Lena, 194)" -- Ann Brashares]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Teenage girls, please don’t worry about being super popular in high school, or being the best actress in high school, or the best athlete. Not only do people not care about any of that the second you graduate, but when you get older, if you reference your successes in high school too much, it actually makes you look kind of pitiful, like some babbling old Tennessee Williams character with nothing else going on in her current life. What I’ve noticed is that almost no one who was a big star in high school is also big star later in life. For us overlooked kids, it’s so wonderfully fair." -- Mindy Kaling]]>

	    <![CDATA["Love doesn’t have to be on Valentine’s Day. It doesn’t have to be by the time you turn eighteen or thirty-three or fifty-nine. It doesn’t have to conform to whatever is usual. It doesn’t have to be kismet at once, or rhapsody by the third day.

It just has to be. In time. In place. In spirt.

It just has to be." -- David Levithan]]>

	    <![CDATA["This is what love does: It makes you want to rewrite the world. It makes you want to choose the characters, build the scenery, guide the plot. The person you love sits across from you, and you want to do everything in your power to make it possible, endlessly possible.  And when it’s just the two of you, alone in a room, you can pretend that this is how it is, this is how it will be." -- David Levithan]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["There are things you do when you are a teenager, or a dancer, or just a girl, I guess. You cut your food up in special ways, or you cut yourself, or paper dolls. You pretend that there is an invisible audience watching you all the time, and you do things to impress them or pretend that they didn’t see what you just did because their live video feed was interrupted somehow. You steal things or tell lies or speak to strangers in a Russian accent. You have sex with someone you love, or with someone who gets you really drunk. You lie to your parents, your boyfriend, yourself, your therapist. You cheat on your homework or do other people’s homework for money. You get up, you take class, you rehearse, you perform, you go to bed. How do you decide which of these things are truly crazy and which are just being alive?" -- Meg Howrey]]>
