	    <![CDATA["When you grow up in middle America you are inculcated from the earliest age with the belief - no, the &lt;i&gt;understanding&lt;/i&gt; - that America is the richest and most powerful nation on earth because God likes us best. It has the most perfect form of government, the most exciting sporting events, the tastiest food and amplest portions, the largest cars, the cheapest gasoline, the most abundant natural resources, the most productive farms, the most devastating nuclear arsenal and the friendliest, most decent and most patriotic folks on Earth.  Countries just don't come any better.  So why anyone would want to live anywhere else is practically incomprehensible.  In a foreigner it is puzzling; in a native it is seditious.  I used to feel this way myself." -- Bill Bryson]]>

	    <![CDATA["Curiously enough, the only thing that went through the mind of the bowl of petunias as it fell was Oh no, not again. Many people have speculated that if we knew exactly why the bowl of petunias had thought that we would know a lot more about the nature of the Universe than we do now." -- Douglas Adams]]>
