	    <![CDATA["se there was a matter of half a ream of brown paper stuck upon me, from first to last. As I laid all of a heap in our kitchen, plastered all over, you might have thought I was a large brown-paper parcel, chock full of nothing but groans. Did I groan loud, Wackford, or did I groan soft?' asked Mr Squeers, appealing to his son." -- Charles Dickens]]>

	    <![CDATA["The way I see it,&quot; Miles went on, &quot;it's no good hiding yourself away, like Pa and lots of other people.  And it's no good just thinking of your own pleasure, either.  People got to do something useful if they're going to take up space in the world." -- Natalie Babbitt]]>

	    <![CDATA["Time is like a wheel. Turning and turning - never stopping. And the woods are the center; the hub of the wheel. It began the first week of summer, a strange and breathless time when accident, or fate, bring lives together. When people are led to do things, they've never done before. On this summer's day, not so very long ago, the wheel set lives in motion in mysterious ways." -- Natalie Babbitt]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Dad himself used to tell a story about one time when Mother went off to fill a lecture engagement and left him in charge at home.  When Mother returned, she asked him if everything had run smoothly.
Didn't have any trouble except with that one over there,' he replied.  'But a spanking brought him into line.'
Mother could handle any crisis without losing her composure.
That's not one of ours, dear,' she said.  'He belongs next door." -- Frank B. Gilbreth Jr.]]>
