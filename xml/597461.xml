	    <![CDATA["Why do I read?
I just can't help myself.
I read to learn and to grow, to laugh   
 and to be motivated.
I read to understand things I've never 
 been exposed to.
I read when I'm crabby, when I've just 
 said monumentally dumb things to the 
 people I love.
I read for strength to help me when I 
 feel broken, discouraged, and afraid.
I read when I'm angry at the whole 
 world.
I read when everything is going right.
I read to find hope.
I read because I'm made up not just of 
 skin and bones, of sights, feelings, 
 and a deep need for chocolate, but I'm 
 also made up of words.
Words describe my thoughts and what's
 hidden in my heart.
Words are alive--when I've found a
 story that I love, I read it again and
 again, like playing a favorite song 
 over and over.
Reading isn't passive--I enter the
 story with the characters, breathe
 their air, feel their frustrations,
 scream at them to stop when they're
 about to do something stupid, cry with
 them, laugh with them.
Reading for me, is spending time with a
 friend.
A book is a friend.
You can never have too many." -- Gary Paulsen]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The primary urge that motivates and engenders writing...is the writer's desire to invent and tell a story, and to know himself.  But the more I write, the more I feel the force of the other urge, which collaborates with and completes the first one: the desire to know the Other from within him.  To feel what it means to be another person.  To be able to touch, if only for a moment, the blaze that burns within another human being." -- David Grossman]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Why do we care about singers? Wherein lies the power of songs? Maybe it derives from the sheer strangeness of there being singing in the world.  The note, the scale, the chord; melodies, harmonies, arrangements; symphonies, ragas, chinese operas,jazz, the blues: that such things should exist, that we should have discovered the magical intervals and distances that yield the poor cluster of notes, all within the span of a human hand from which we can build our cathedrals of sound, is alchemical a mystery as mathematics, or wine, or love.  Maybe the birds taught us. Maybe not. Maybe we are just creatures in search of exaltation. We don't have much of it. Our lives are not what we deserve; they are, let us agree, in many painful ways deficient. Song turns them into something else. Song shows us a world that is worthy of our yearning, it shows us our selves as they might be, if we were worthy of the world. " -- Salmon Rushdie]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I felt I was drawing close to that age, that place in life, where you realize one day what you'd told yourself was a Zen detachment turns out to be naked fear. You'd had one serious love relationship in your life and it had ended in tragedy, and the tragedy had broken something inside you. But instead of trying to repair the broken place, or at least really stop and look at it, you skated and joked. You had friends, you were a decent citizen. You hurt no one. And your life was somehow just about half of what it could be." -- Roland Merullo]]>

I often seek electronic books, but they never come after me. They may make me feel, but I can't feel them. They are all soul with no flesh, no texture, and no weight." -- Will Schwalbe]]>

Gradually, you accumulate the parts of her that are gone. Just when the day comes—when there's a particular missing part that overwhelms you with the feeling that she's gone, forever—there comes another day, and another specifically missing part." -- John Irving]]>
