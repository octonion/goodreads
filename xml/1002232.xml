		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Yet it seems to me finishing well in this life is not so much about who is the best or greatest at something, but rather who embraces lowliness of heart. Laying down one's rights- meekness- is a blessed virtue, one that must surely come straight from the Throne of Grace." -- Beverly Lewis]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I used to think I knew everything. I was a &quot;smart person&quot; who &quot;got things done,&quot; and because of that, the higher I climbed, the more I could look down and scoff at what seemed silly or simple, even religion.
But I realized something as I drove home that night: that I am neither better nor smarter, only luckier. And I should be ashamed of thinking I knew everything, because you can know the whole world and still feel lost in it. So many people are in pain-no matter how smart or accomplished-they cry, they yearn, they hurt.But instead of looking down on things, they look up, which is where I should have been looking, too. Because when the world quiets to the sound of your own breathing, we all want the same things:comfort, love, and a peaceful heart." -- Mitch Albom]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I think people expect too much from marriage today,' he said. 'They expect perfection. Every moment should be bliss. That's TV or movies. But that is not the human experience.
. . . twenty good minutes here, forty good minutes there, it adds up to something beautiful. The trick is when things aren't so great, you don't junk the whole thing. It's okay to have an argument. It's okay that the other one nudges you a little, bothers you a little. It's part of being close to someone.
But the joy you get from that same closeness--when you watch your children, when you wake up and smile at each other--that . . . is a blessing. People forget that." -- Mitch Albom]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["When a baby comes into the world, its hands are clenched, right?  Like this?&quot;  He made a fist.  &quot;Why?  Because a baby not knowing any better, wants to grab everything, to say the whole world is mine.  But when an old person dies, how does he do so?  With his hands open.  Why?  Because he has learned his lesson.&quot;  &quot;What lesson?&quot;  I asked.  He stretched open his empty fingers.  &quot;We can take nothing with us." -- mitch albom]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The story of my recent life.' I like that phrase. It makes more sense than 'the story of my life', because we get so many lives between birth and death. A life to be a child. A life to come of age. A life to wander, to settle, to fall in love, to parent, to test our promise, to realize our mortality- and in some lucky cases, to do something after that realization." -- Mitch Albom]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Try to imagine a life without timekeeping. You probably can’t. You know the month, the year, the day of the week. There is a clock on your wall or the dashboard of your car. You have a schedule, a calendar, a time for dinner or a movie. Yet all around you, timekeeping is ignored. Birds are not late. A dog does not check its watch. Deer do not fret over passing birthdays. an alone measures time. Man alone chimes the hour. And, because of this, man alone suffers a paralyzing fear that no other creature endures. A fear of time running out." -- Mitch Albom]]>
