	    <![CDATA["Let me get this straight...You are sending me out in a minivan whose date of manufacture predates the year of my birth, so that I can watch two dragon slayers track down enormous fire-breathing animals, in an effort to prevent me from spending time in the &lt;i&gt;library&lt;/i&gt;?" -- E.K.

	    <![CDATA["Honestly, Jared, one thing at a time. Why are you in a well with me? This is a really bad rescue!&quot; [...]
&quot;I called the police as I was running to the well. I'm sure they're coming.&quot;
&quot;Did they say they were coming?&quot; Kami asked suspiciously. &quot;Or did you shout, 'Kami's in the well!' before jumping in the well too, thus loosing your phone and making sure the police think it was some kids playing a dumb joke?&quot;
Jared paused. [...] 
&quot;Alternate plan,&quot; Jared said. &quot;Do you have a very intelligent collie who might communicate through a system of barks to your parents that little Kami is in the well?" -- Sarah Rees Brennan]]>
