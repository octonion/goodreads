	    <![CDATA["Once there were brook trout in the streams in the mountains. You could see them standing in the amber current where the white edges of their fins wimpled softly in the flow. They smelled of moss in your hand. Polished and muscular and torsional. On their backs were vermiculate patterns that were maps of the world in its becoming. Maps and mazes. Of a thing which could not be put back. Not be made right again. In the deep glens where they lived all things were older than man and they hummed of mystery." -- Cormac McCarthy]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["He walked out in the gray light and stood and he saw for a brief moment the absolute truth of the world. The cold relentless circling of the intestate earth. Darkness implacable. The blind dogs of the sun in their running. The crushing black vacuum of the universe. And somewhere two hunted animals trembling like ground-foxes in their cover. Borrowed time and borrowed world and borrowed eyes with which to sorrow it." -- Cormac McCarthy]]>

	    <![CDATA["MEMORY'S SO &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;TREACHEROUS.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; ONE MOMENT YOU'RE LOST IN A &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;CARNIVAL&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; OF &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;DELIGHTS,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; WITH POIGNANT CHILDHOOD &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;AROMAS&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, THE FLASHING NEON OF &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;PUBERTY,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; ALL THAT SENTIMENTAL &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;CANDY-FLOSS&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;...

THE &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;NEXT&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, IT LEADS YOU SOMEWHERE YOU DON'T WANT TO &lt;b&gt;GO...&lt;/b&gt;

...SOMEWHERE &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;DARK&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; AND &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;COLD,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; FILLED WITH THE DAMP, AMBIGUOUS SHAPES OF THINKS YOU'D HOPED WERE &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;FORGOTTEN.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;MEMORIES&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; CAN BE &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;VILE, REPULSIVE&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; LITTLE &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;BRUTES.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; LIKE &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;CHILDREN,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; I SUPPOSE. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;HAHA.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

BUT CAN WE LIVE &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;WITHOUT&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; THEM? &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;MEMORIES&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; ARE WHAT OUR &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;REASON&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; IS BASED UPON. IF WE CAN'T &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;FACE&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; THEM, WE DENY REASON ITSELF!

ALGHOUGH, WHY &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;NOT?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; WE AREN'T &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;CONTRACTUALLY TIED DOWN&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; TO &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;RATIONALITY!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

THERE &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;IS&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; NO &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;SANITY CLAUSE!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

SO WHEN YOU FIND YOURSELF LOCKED ONTO AN UNPLEASANT TRAIN OF THOUGHT, HEADING FOR THE PLACES IN YOUR PAST WHERE THE SCREAMING IS &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;UNBEARABLE,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; REMEMBER THERE'S ALWAYS &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;MADNESS.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;MADNESS&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; IS THE &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;EMERGENCY EXIT...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

YOU CAN JUST STEP &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;OUTSIDE,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; AND CLOSE THE DOOR ON ALL THOSE DREADFUL THINGS THAT HAPPENED. YOU CAN LOCK THEM &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;AWAY...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

FOREVER." -- Alan Moore]]>

	    <![CDATA["We have to create culture, don't watch TV, don't read magazines, don't even listen to NPR. Create your own roadshow. The nexus of space and time where you are now is the most immediate sector of your universe, and if you're worrying about Michael Jackson or Bill Clinton or somebody else, then you are disempowered, you're giving it all away to icons, icons which are maintained by an electronic media so that you want to dress like X or have lips like Y. This is shit-brained, this kind of thinking. That is all cultural diversion, and what is real is you and your friends and your associations, your highs, your orgasms, your hopes, your plans, your fears. And we are told 'no', we're unimportant, we're peripheral. 'Get a degree, get a job, get a this, get a that.' And then you're a player, you don't want to even play in that game. You want to reclaim your mind and get it out of the hands of the cultural engineers who want to turn you into a half-baked moron consuming all this trash that's being manufactured out of the bones of a dying world." -- Terence McKenna]]>
