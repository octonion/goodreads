		<description>
	    <![CDATA["One of the cheapest commodities in the world is unfulfilled genius.  All of us want to be known as a unique individual, the one who broke out of the pack.  So, you offer yourself up as a sacrifice and what you’re afraid of is losing and being thrown back into the pack.  One question taunts you.  Do you want to have, or do you want to be?" -- Leon Uris]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Nothing that is worth doing can be achieved in our lifetime; therefore we must be saved by hope. 

Nothing which is true or beautiful or good makes complete sense in any immediate context of history; therefore we must be saved by faith. 

Nothing we do, however virtuous, can be accomplished alone; therefore we must be saved by love. 

No virtuous act is quite as virtuous from the standpoint of our friend or foe as it is from our standpoint. Therefore we must be saved by the final form of love which is forgiveness." -- Reinhold Niebuhr]]>

	    <![CDATA["Love is anticipation and memory, uncertainty and longing.  It’s unreasonable, of course.

And like a story, love must be troubled to be interesting." -- John Dufresne]]>

	    <![CDATA["The master in the art of living makes little distinction between his work and his play, his labor and his leisure, his mind and his body, his information and his recreation, his love and his religion. He hardly knows which is which. He simply pursues his vision of excellence at whatever he does, leaving others to decide whether he is working or playing. To him he's always doing both.

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Hardly a pure science, history is closer to animal husbandry than it is to mathematics in that it involves selective breeding. The principal difference between the husbandryman and the historian is that the former breeds sheep or cows or such and the latter breeds (assumed) facts. The husbandryman uses his skills to enrich the future, the historian uses his to enrich the past. Both are usually up to their ankles in bullshit." -- Tom Robbins]]>
