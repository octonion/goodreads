	    <![CDATA["For the special thrilling quality of their friendship was in their complete surrender.  Like two open cities in the midst of some vast plain their two minds lay open to each other.  And it wasn't as if he rode into hers like a conqueror, armed to the eyebrows and seeing nothing but a gay silken flutter--nor did she enter his like a queen walking on soft petals. No, they were eager, serious travellers, absorbed in understanding what was to be seen and discovering what was hidden--making the most of this extraordinary absolute chance which made it possible for him to be utterly truthful to her and for her to be utterly sincere with him." -- Katherine Mansfield]]>

	    <![CDATA["It's true--I can see it now--we are made of where we've come from, molded by landscape, weather, harbors, hunger, and war, as much as by individual ancestors.  The experience of the place--its struggles, strife, and horrors--accrues, even if we haven't personally experienced it.  We are, still, its inevitable consequence." -- Deborah Tall]]>
