		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Because mankind can circumvent evolutionary law, it is incumbent upon him, say evolutionary biologists to develop another law to abide by if he wishes to survive, to not outstrip his food base.  He must learn restraint.  He must derive some other, wiser way of behaving toward the land.  He must be more attentive to the biological imperatives of the system of sun-driven protoplasm upon which he, too, is still dependent.  Not because he must, because he lacks inventiveness, but because herein is the accomplishment of the wisdom that for centuries he has aspired to.  Having taken on his own destiny, he must now think with critical intelligence about where to defer." -- Barry Lopez]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I must say a word about fear. It is life's only true opponent. Only fear can defeat life. It is a clever, treacherous adversary, how well I know. It has no decency, respects no law or convention, shows no mercy. It goes for your weakest spot, which it finds with unnerving ease. It begins in your mind, always ... so you must fight hard to express it. You must fight hard to shine the light of words upon it. Because if you don't, if your fear becomes a wordless darkness that you avoid, perhaps even manage to forget, you open yourself to further attacks of fear because you never truly fought the opponent who defeated you." -- Yann Martel]]>

	    <![CDATA["These people fail to realize that it is on the inside that God must be defended, not on the outside. They should direct their anger at themselves. For evil in the open is but evil from within that has been let out. The main battlefield for good is not the open ground of the public arena but the small clearing of each heart." -- Yann Martel]]>

Our sons ought to study mathematics and philosophy, geography, natural history and naval architecture, navigation, commerce and agriculture in order to give their children a right to study painting, poetry, music, architecture, statuary, tapestry and porcelain." -- John Adams]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["...Turn our thoughts, in the next place, to the characters of learned men. The priesthood have, in all ancient nations, nearly monopolized learning. Read over again all the accounts we have of Hindoos, Chaldeans, Persians, Greeks, Romans, Celts, Teutons, we shall find that priests had all the knowledge, and really governed all mankind. Examine Mahometanism, trace Christianity from its first promulgation; knowledge has been almost exclusively confined to the clergy. And, even since the Reformation, when or where has existed a Protestant or dissenting sect who would tolerate a free inquiry? The blackest billingsgate, the most ungentlemanly insolence, the most yahooish brutality is patiently endured, countenanced, propagated, and applauded. But touch a solemn truth in collision with a dogma of a sect, though capable of the clearest proof, and you will soon find you have disturbed a nest, and the hornets will swarm about your legs and hands, and fly into your face and eyes.

[&lt;i&gt;Letters to John Taylor, 1814, XVIII, p. 484&lt;/i&gt;]" -- John Adams]]>

	    <![CDATA["But it does no good--solves nothing--to distance myself from the front lines of human need by using the mail as a safe shelter.  I believe that serving the best ends of humanity means getting out in the middle of it just as it is, not staying home writing checks and thinking hopeful thoughts.  The world does not need tourists who ride by in a bus clucking their tongues.  The world as it is needs those who will love it enough to change it, with what they have, where they are.  And you're damned right that's idealistic.  No apology.  When idealism goes into the trash as junk mail, we're finished." -- Robert Fulghum]]>

	    <![CDATA["Because you have seen something doesn't mean you can explain it. Differing interpretations will always abound, even when good minds come to bear.  The kernel of indisputable information is a dot in space; interpretations grow out of the desire to make this point a line, to give it direction.  The directions in which it can be sent, the uses to which it can be put by a culturally, professionally, and geographically diverse society are almost without limit.  The possibilities make good scientists chary." -- Barry Lopez]]>

	    <![CDATA["These are the times in which a genius would wish to live. It is not in the still calm of life, or the repose of a pacific station, that great characters are formed. The habits of a vigorous mind are formed in contending with difficulties. Great necessities call out great virtues. When a mind is raised, and animated by scenes that engage the heart, then those qualities which would otherwise lay dormant, wake into life and form the character of the hero and the statesman." -- Abigail Adams]]>
