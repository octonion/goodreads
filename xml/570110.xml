	    <![CDATA["Son, you can't go around painting yourself black, you hear?&quot; 
&quot;Why not, Papa?&quot; 
&quot;Because they'll take you away.&quot; 
&quot;Why?&quot; 
&quot;Because you shouldn't want to be like black people or Jewish people or anyone who is...not us.&quot; 
&quot;Who are Jewish people?&quot; 
&quot;You know my oldest customer, Mr. Kaufmann? Where we bought your shoes?&quot; 
&quot;Yes.&quot; 
&quot;Well, he's Jewish.&quot; 
&quot;I didn't know that. Do you have to pay to be Jewish? Do you need a license?&quot; 
..... 
&quot;...you've got beautiful blond hair and big safe blue eyes. You should be happy with that; is that clear?" -- Markus Zusak]]>
