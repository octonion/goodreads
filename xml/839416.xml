	    <![CDATA["Mother, have you noticed that this society we’re in tends to be a little…repressive?” 
    “What does that mean, Eugenie? What does that mean, that strange new word, ‘repressive,’ that I have never heard before?” 
    “It means…it’s like when you decide to do something, and you get up out of your chair to do it, and you take a step, and then become aware of frosty glances being directed at you from every side.” 
    “Frosty glances?” 
    “Your desires are stifled.” 
    “What desires are you talking about?” 
    “Just desires in general. Any desires. It’s a whole…I guess atmosphere is the…word…a tendency on the part of the society…” 
    “You’d better sew some more pillow cases, Eugenie." -- Donald Barthelme ]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["For those who believe in God, most of the big questions are answered. But for those of us who can't readily accept the God formula, the big answers don't remain stone-written. We adjust to new conditions and discoveries. We are pliable. Love need not be a command nor faith a dictum. I am my own god. We are here to unlearn the teachings of the church, state, and our educational system. We are here to drink beer. We are here to kill war. We are here to laugh at the odds and live our lives so well that Death will tremble to take us." -- Charles Bukowski]]>

	    <![CDATA[https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/314315-let-everything-that-s-been-planned-come-true-let-them-believe]]>
		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Let everything that's been planned come true. Let them believe. And let them have a laugh at their passions. Because what they call passion actually is not some emotional energy, but just the friction between their souls and the outside world. And most important, let them believe in themselves. Let them be helpless like children, because weakness is a great thing, and strength is nothing. When a man is just born, he is weak and flexible. When he dies, he is hard and insensitive. When a tree is growing, it's tender and pliant. But when it's dry and hard, it dies. Hardness and strength are death's companions. Pliancy and weakness are expressions of the freshness of being. Because what has hardened will never win." -- Andrei Tarkovsky]]>

	    <![CDATA["Some sort of pressure must exist; the artist exists because the world is not perfect. Art would be useless if the world were perfect, as man wouldn’t look for harmony but would simply live in it. Art is born out of an ill-designed world." -- Andrei Tarkovsky]]>
