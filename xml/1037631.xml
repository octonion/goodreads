	    <![CDATA["An intellectual? Yes. And never deny it. An intellectual is someone whose mind watches itself. I like this, because I am happy to be both halves, the watcher and the watched. &quot;Can they be brought together?&quot; This is a practical question. We must get down to it. &quot;I despise intelligence&quot; really means: &quot;I cannot bear my doubts." -- Albert Camus]]>

His acts being seven ages." -- William Shakespeare]]>

	    <![CDATA["I am a Jew. Hath not a Jew eyes? Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions; fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject to the same diseases, 
heal'd by the same means, warm'd and cool'd by the same winter and summer, as a Christian is? 

If you prick us, do we not bleed? If 
you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? 

And if you wrong us, do we not revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will resemble you in that." -- William Shakespeare]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I am a sick man... I am a spiteful man.  I am an unpleasant man.  I think my liver is diseased.  However, I don't know beans about my disease, and I am not sure what is bothering me.  I don't treat it and never have, though I respect medicine and doctors.  Besides, I am extremely superstitious, let's say sufficiently so to respect medicine.  (I am educated enough not to be superstitious, but I am.)  No, I refuse to treat it out of spite.  You probably will not understand that.  Well, but I understand it.  Of course I can't explain to you just whom I am annoying in this case by my spite.  I am perfectly well aware that I cannot &quot;get even&quot; with the doctors by not consulting them.  I know better than anyone that I thereby injure only myself and no one else.  But still, if I don't treat it, its is out of spite.  My liver is bad, well then-- let it get even worse!" -- Fyodor Dostoevsky]]>
