	    <![CDATA["The truth is, when our mothers held us, rocked us, stroked our heads -none of us ever got enough of that. We all yearn in some way to return to those days when we were completely taken care of - unconditional love, unconditional attention. Most of us didn't get enough." -- Mitch Albom]]>

	    <![CDATA["Don't cling to things,  because everything is impermanent... But detachment doesn't mean you don't let the experience penetrate you. 
On the contrary, you let it penetrate you fully. That's how you are able to leave it...You're afraid of the pain, you're afraid of the grief... But by throwing yourself into these emotions, by allowing yourself to dive in, all the way, over your head even, you experience them fully and completely.You know what pain is. You know what love is. &quot;All right. I have experienced that emotion. I recognize that emotion. Now I need to detach from that emotion for a moment." -- Mitch Albom]]>
