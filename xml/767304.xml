	    <![CDATA["Even if there is only one possible unified theory, it is just a set of rules and equations. What is it that breathes fire into the equations and makes a universe for them to describe? The usual approach of science of constructing a mathematical model cannot answer the questions of why there should be a universe for the model to describe. Why does the universe go to all the bother of existing?" -- Stephen Hawking]]>

I like this, because I am happy to be both halves, the watcher and the watched. &quot;Can they be brought together?&quot; This is a practical question. We must get down to it. &quot;I despise intelligence&quot; really means: &quot;I cannot bear my doubts." -- Albert Camus]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Please stop patronizing those who are reading a book - The Da Vinci Code, maybe- because they are enjoying it.  For a start, none of us know what kind of an effort this represents for the individual reader.  It could be his or her first full-length adult novel; it might be the book that finally reveals the purpose and joy of reading to someone who has hitherto been mystified by the attraction books exert on others.  And anyway, reading for enjoyment is what we should all be doing.  I don't mean we should all be reading chick lit or thrillers (although if that's what you want to read, it's fine by me, because here's something no one else will tell you: if you don't read the classics, or the novel that won this year's Booker Prize, then nothing bad will happen to you; more importantly,nothing good will happen to you if you do); I simply mean that turning pages should not be like walking through thick mud.  The whole purpose of books is that we read them, and if you find you can't, it might not be your inadequacy that's to blame.  &quot;Good&quot; books can be pretty awful sometimes." -- Nick Hornby]]>
