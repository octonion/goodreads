	    <![CDATA["If a guy were dating my daughter but didn't want to spend the gas money to come pick her up or refused to buy her dinner because it cost too much, I would question whether he were really in love with her  In the same way, I question whether many American churchgoers are really in love with God because they are so hesitant to do anything for Him.&quot;  Crazy Love: Overwhelmed by a Relentless God" -- Francis Chan]]>
