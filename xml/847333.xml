		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I believe in those whom I love and trust. All else is foolishness. This god is as empty as his church. His followers choose to attribute all of their good fortune to him, but when he ignores their pleas or leaves them to suffer, they say only that he ignores their pleas or leaves them to suffer, they say only that he is beyond their understanding and abandon themselves to his will. What kind of god is that?" -- John Connolly]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The nature of compassion isn't coming to terms with your own suffering and applying it to others:  It's knowing that other folks around you suffer and, no matter what happens to you, no matter how lucky or unlucky you are, they keep suffering.  And if you can do something about that, then you do it, and you do it without whining or waving your own fuckin' cross for the world to see.  You do it because it's the right thing to do." -- John Connolly ]]>
