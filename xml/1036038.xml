	    <![CDATA["Love Dogs

   One night a man was crying,
   Allah! Allah!
   His lips grew sweet with the praising,
   until a cynic said,
   &quot;So! I have heard you
   calling out, but have you ever
   gotten any response?&quot;

   The man had no answer to that.
   He quit praying and fell into a confused sleep.

   He dreamed he saw Khidr, the guide of souls,
   in a thick, green foliage.
   &quot;Why did you stop praising?&quot;
   &quot;Because I've never heard anything back.&quot;
   &quot;This longing
   you express is the return message.&quot;

   The grief you cry out from
   draws you toward union.

   Your pure sadness
   that wants help
   is the secret cup.

   Listen to the moan of a dog for its master.
   That whining is the connection.

   There are love dogs
   no one knows the names of.

   Give your life
   to be one of them." -- Jalal Al-Din Rumi]]>
