		<description>
	    <![CDATA["And thus woman has been definitely established as the Other.  Western mythology itself was a patriarchal construct; through its portrayal of woman as the ambivalent projection of man's fears and desires, not as her own independent self, mythology translates the message that woman must respect a 'natural order of things' or risk responsibility for human chaos and destruction." -- Doris Meyer]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Every morning brings us news of the globe, and yet we are poor in noteworthy stories.  This is because no event comes to us without being already shot through with explanation.  In other words, by now almost nothing that happens benefits storytelling; almost everything benefits information.  Actually, it is half the art of storytelling to keep a story free from explanation as one reproduces it. . . . The most extraordinary things, marvelous things, are related with the greatest accuracy, but the psychological connection of the event is not forced on the reader.  It is left up to him to interpret things the way he understands them, and thus the narrative achieves an amplitude that information lacks." -- Walter Benjamin]]>
