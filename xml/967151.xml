	    <![CDATA["Stories nurture our connection to place and to each other. They show us where we have been and where we can go. They remind us of how to be human, how to live alongside the other lives that animate this planet. ... When we lose stories, our understanding of the world is less rich, less true." -- Susan J. Tweit]]>

	    <![CDATA["The truest art I would strive for in any work would be to give the page the same qualities as earth: weather would land on it harshly, light would elucidate the most difficult truths; wind would sweep away obtuse padding. Finally, the lessons of impermanence taught me this: loss constitutes an odd kind of fullness; despair empties out into an unquenchable appetite for life." -- Gretel Ehrlich]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Long before I wrote stories, I listened for stories. Listening for them is something more acute than listening to them. I suppose itâ€™s an early form of participation in what goes on. Listening children know stories are there. When their elders sit and begin, children are just waiting and hoping for one to come out, like a mouse from its hole." -- Eudora Welty]]>
