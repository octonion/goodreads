	    <![CDATA["I love this world,&quot; he added.  &quot;That is what rules my life.  When I die, I want to have done all in my power to leave it in a better state than it was when I found it.  At the same time I know that this can never be.  The world has grown so complex that one voice can do little to alter it any longer.  That doesn't stop me from doing what I can, but it makes the task hard.  The successes are so small, the failures so large and many.  It's like trying to stem a storm with one's bare hands." -- Charles de Lint]]>
