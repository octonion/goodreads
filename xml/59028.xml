	    <![CDATA["The Road Not Taken

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both	
And be one traveler, long I stood	
And looked down one as far as I could	
To where it bent in the undergrowth;	        
 
Then took the other, as just as fair,	
And having perhaps the better claim,	
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;	
Though as for that the passing there	
Had worn them really about the same,	        
 
And both that morning equally lay	
In leaves no step had trodden black.	
Oh, I kept the first for another day!	
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,	
I doubted if I should ever come back.	        
 
I shall be telling this with a sigh	
Somewhere ages and ages hence:	
Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”	
I took the one less traveled by,	
And that has made all the difference." -- Robert Frost]]>

	    <![CDATA["The Road goes ever on and on
Down from the door where it began.
Now far ahead the Road has gone,
And I must follow, if I can,
Pursuing it with eager feet,
Until it joins some larger way
Where many paths and errands meet.
And whither then? I cannot say" -- J.R.R. Tolkien]]>
