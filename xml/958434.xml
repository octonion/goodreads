	    <![CDATA["Life is choice.  All day, everyday. Who we talk to, where we sit, what we say, how we say it.  And our lives become defined by our choices.  It's as simple and as complex as that. And as powerful.  so when I'm observing that's what I'm watching for.  The choices people make" -- Louise Penny]]>

	    <![CDATA["It’s all right,” she said. “You’re through.” 

“Jesus,” he finally managed, pushing water off his face. “Jesus Christ and John the Baptist. For that matter, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John.” Still not enough. He needed to reach back to the Old Testament for this. “Obadiah. Nebuchadnezzar. Methuselah and Job.” 

“Be calm,” she said, taking him by the shoulders. “Be calm. And there are women in the Bible, you know.” 

“Yes. As I recall it, they were trouble, every last one." -- Tessa Dare]]>

	    <![CDATA["Oh, it's simple pragmatism, Dad.  It's called the real world.  If we refused to do business with the morally questionable, the deal volume would drop in half and the good guys like us would end up poor. Then where would we all be?&quot; said Roger.  &quot;On a nice dry spit of land know as the moral high ground?&quot;  suggested the Major." -- Helen Simonson]]>
