		<description>
	    <![CDATA["At some point during almost every romantic comedy, the female lead suddenly trips and falls, stumbling helplessly over something ridiculous like a leaf, and then some Matthew McConaughey type either whips around the corner just in the nick of time to save her or is clumsily pulled down along with her. That event predictably leads to the magical moment of their first kiss. Please. I fall ALL the time. You know who comes and gets me? The bouncer." -- Chelsea Handler]]>

	    <![CDATA["Are you there vodka? It's me, Chelsea. Please get me out of jail and I promise I will never drink again. Drink and drive. I will never drink and drive again. I may even start my own group fashioned after MADD, Mothers Against Drunk Driving, but I'll call it AWLTDASH, Alcoholics Who Like to Drink and Stay Home." -- Chelsea Handler]]>

	    <![CDATA["I had to feign interest in all this nonsense until I could ask when I could come over and sit on his face.  I didn't say that out loud, of course.  I never say the things I really want to.  If I did, I'd have no friends." -- Chelsea Handler]]>
