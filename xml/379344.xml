		<description>
	    <![CDATA["What I've found about it is that there are some folks you can talk to until you're blue in the face--they're never going to get it and they're never going to change.  But every once in a while, you'll run into someone who is eager to listen, eager to learn, and willing to try new things.  Those are the people we need to reach.  We have a responsibility as parents, older people, teachers, people in the neighborhood to recognize that." -- Tyler Perry]]>

	    <![CDATA["...when you put on your shortest dress, please leave some mystery in it.  That's the difference between a miniskirt and a ho-skirt.  A ho-skirt shows your Frisbee.  A miniskirt shows just enough to cause some mystery.  What these young women lack is mystery." -- Tyler Perry]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["My friend Madea has &quot;attitude&quot; that comes with wisdom.   Back in our teens and twenties, we thought we knew everything and made all those foolish mistakes.  Then, when we got a little older, at thirty, we started getting these flashes of light, revelations of what a great and lucky thing it is that we didn't get caught doing those stupid things back then.  Around forty, if we are lucky, we stop lying to ourselves.  Fifty and above, we've run out of patience for foolishness.  Take me to the bottom line." -- Tyler Perry]]>
