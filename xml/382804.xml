	    <![CDATA["We do the best we can,&quot; she said softly, looking inward. &quot;And punish ourselves for it.

That should count for something, shouldn't it?" -- Tami Hoag]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["There is much pain that is quite noiseless; and vibrations that make human agonies are often a mere whisper in the roar of hurrying existence. There are glances of hatred that stab and raise no cry of murder; robberies that leave man or woman for ever beggared of peace and joy, yet kept secret by the sufferer --committed to no sound except that of low moans in the night, seen in no writing except that made on the face by the slow months of suppressed anguish and early morning tears. Many an inherited sorrow that has marred a life has been breathed into no human ear." -- George Eliot ]]>
