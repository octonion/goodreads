	    <![CDATA["You attend the funeral, you bid the dead farewell. You grieve. Then you continue with your life. And at times the fact of her absence will hit you like a blow to the chest, and you will weep. But this will happen less and less as time goes on. She is dead. You are alive. So live." -- Neil Gaiman]]>

	    <![CDATA["If we can forgive what has been done to us . . .

If we can forgive what we've done to others . . .

If we can leave all of our stories behind.  Our being
villians or victims.

Only then can we maybe rescue the world.

But we still sit here, waiting to be saved.  While we're
still victims, hoping to be discovered while we suffer." -- Chuck Palahniuk]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["We can spend our lives letting the world tell us who we are. Sane or insane. Saints or sex addicts. Heroes or victims. Letting history tell us how good or bad we are. Letting our past decide our future. Or we can decide for ourselves. And maybe it's our job to invent something better." -- Chuck Palahniuk]]>
