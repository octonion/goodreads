	    <![CDATA["While the astronauts, heroes forever, spent mere hours on the moon, I have remained in this new world for nearly thirty years. I know that my achievement is quite ordinary. I am not the only man to seek his fortune far from home, and certainly I am not the first. Still, there are times I am bewildered by each mile I have traveled, each meal I have eaten, each person I have known, each room in which I have slept. As ordinary as it all appears, there are times when it is beyond my imagination.&quot; (from &quot;The Third and Final Continent&quot;)" -- Jhumpa Lahiri]]>

	    <![CDATA["May your coming year be filled with magic and dreams and good madness. I hope you read some fine books and kiss someone who thinks you're wonderful, and don't forget to make some art -- write or draw or build or sing or live as only you can. And I hope, somewhere in the next year, you surprise yourself." -- Neil Gaiman]]>

	    <![CDATA["So wherever I am, there's always Pooh,
There's always Pooh and Me.
&quot;What would I do?&quot; I said to Pooh,
&quot;If it wasn't for you,&quot; and Pooh said to me: &quot;True,
It isn't much fun for One, but Two
Can stick together,&quot; says Pooh, says he.
&quot;That's how it is,&quot; says Pooh." -- A.A. Milne]]>
