	    <![CDATA["Listen. To live is to be marked. To live is to change, to acquire the words of a story, and that is the only celebration we mortals really know. In perfect stillness, frankly, I've only found sorrow." -- Barbara Kingsolver]]>

	    <![CDATA["The Jewish sages also tell us that God dances when His children defeat Him in argument, when they stand on their feet and use their minds.  So questions like Anne's are worth asking.  To ask them is a very fine kind of human behavior.  If we keep demanding that God yield up His answers, perhaps some day we will understand them.  And then we will be something more than clever apes, and we shall dance with God." -- Mary Doria Russell]]>
