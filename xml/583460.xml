I've got a theor-

Bunnies aren't just cute like everybody supposes
They've got them hoppy legs and twitchy little noses.
And what's with all the carrots-?
What do they need such good eyesight for anyway?
Bunnies, bunnies it must be bunnies!

...or maybe midgets..." -- Joss Whedon Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]>

	    <![CDATA["How strange that the nature of life is change, yet the nature of human beings is to resist change. And how ironic that the difficult times we fear might ruin us are the very ones that can break us open and help us blossom into who we were meant to be." -- Elizabeth Lesser]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I was ten when I heard the music that ended the first phase of my life and cast me hurtling into a new horizon.  Drenched to the skin, I stood on Dunoon’s pier peering seawards through diagonal rain, looking for the ferry that would take me home.  There, on the everwet west coast of Scotland, I heard it: like sonic scalpels, the sounds of electric guitars sliced through the dreich weather.  My body hairs pricked up, each one a willing receiver for the Thunder-God grooves.  To my young ears, the sound of these amplified guitars was angelic (although, with hindsight, I don’t suppose angels play Gibson guitars at ear-bleeding volume).  A voice that suggested vocal chords of polished silver soared alongside razor-sharp overdriven riffs.  I knew that I was hearing the future." -- Mark Rice]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Our individuality is all, all, that we have. There are those who barter it for security, those who repress it for what they believe is the betterment of the whole society, but blessed in the twinkle of the morning star is the one who nurtures it and rides it in, in grace and love and wit, from peculiar station to peculiar station along life's bittersweet route." -- Tom Robbins]]>
