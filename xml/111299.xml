Not all those who wander are lost;
The old that is strong does not wither,
Deep roots are not reached by the frost.

From the ashes a fire shall be woken,
A light from the shadows shall spring;
Renewed shall be blade that was broken,
The crownless again shall be king." -- J.R.R. Tolkien]]>

	    <![CDATA["We all want to be stars.  The idea of being revered and envied must be encoded somewhere deep in our DNA.  So must the desire to revere and envy others we imagine to be better, more accepted, and more popular than we are.  The only problem is that the most necessary qualities required to be a celebrity -- self-absorption, egomania, shamelessness -- are the least attractive in a friend." -- Tonya Hurley]]>
