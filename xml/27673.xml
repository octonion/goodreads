	    <![CDATA["It didn't matter in the end how old they had been, or that they were girls, but only that we had loved them, and that they hadn't heard us calling, still do not hear us, up here in the tree house, with our thinning hair and soft bellies, calling them out of those rooms where they went to be alone for all time, alone in suicide, which is deeper than death, and where we will never find the pieces to put them back together." -- Jeffrey Eugenides]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Survival rates for breast cancer are relatively good, but Krishnan has been around illness enough to know there is usually a cruel injustice about the way it strikes. Cranky patients defy the odds, while the kind ones, the ones who bake him cookies or bring him tomatoes from their garden, always seem to die early. Mortality rates utilize the law of averages without consideration for who is most deserving." -- Shilpi Somaya Gowda]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["-You don't like confrontation?
Sometimes I'm really down for confrontation. It's kind of like a changing thing. I don't know why.

Must be something that makes me differentiate between things I want to be straight-ahead about, and things that I DON'T want to be straight-ahead about. I think that most people have that mechanism. But some people handle it differently- they just go, &quot;Well, this is something I don't wanna do that I gotta do.&quot; Some people think, &quot;This is something I don't wanna do that I'm gonna do- but kinda half-assed.&quot; I think I fall into THAT category, heh heh heh." -- Jimmy McDonough]]>
