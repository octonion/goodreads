	    <![CDATA["&lt;i&gt;I will be very careful the next time I fall in love&lt;/i&gt;, she told herself. Also, she had made a promise to herself that she intended on keeping. She was never going to go out with another writer: no matter how charming, sensitive, inventive or fun they could be. They weren't worth it in the long run.  They were emotionally too expensive and the upkeep was complicated. They were like having a vacuum cleaner around the house that broke all the time and only Einstein could fix it. 
    She wanted her next lover to be a broom." -- Richard Brautigan]]>

	    <![CDATA["My kids are starting to notice I'm a little different from the other dads. &quot;Why don't you have a straight job like everyone else?&quot; they asked me the other day. 

I told them this story: 
In the forest, there was a crooked tree and a straight tree. Every day, the straight tree would say to the crooked tree, &quot;Look at me...I'm tall, and I'm straight, and I'm handsome. Look at you...you're all crooked and bent over. No one wants to look at you.&quot; And they grew up in that forest together. And then one day the loggers came, and they saw the crooked tree and the straight tree, and they said, &quot;Just cut the straight trees and leave the rest.&quot; So the loggers turned all the straight trees into lumber and toothpicks and paper. And the crooked tree is still there, growing stronger and stranger every day." -- Tom Waits]]>

I don't know what it was growing in but I think we used to put eggshells out there and coffee grounds, too. Don't plant your bad days. They grow into weeks. The weeks grow into months. Before you know it you got yourself a bad year. Take it from me. Choke those little bad days. Choke 'em down to nothin'. They're your days. Choke 'em!" -- Tom Waits]]>
