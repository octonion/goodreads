		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Every relationship has at least one really good day. What I mean is, no matter how sour things go, there's always that day. That day is always in your possession. That's the day you remember. You get old and you think: well, at least I had that day. It happened once. You think all the variables might just line up again. But they don't. Not always. I once talked to a woman who said, &quot;Yeah, that's the day we had an angel around." -- Charles Baxter]]>

	    <![CDATA["I spent hours putting that cassette together.  To me, making a tape is like writing a letter - there's a lot of erasing and rethinking and starting again, and I wanted it to be a good one. . . A good compilation tape, like breaking up, is hard to do.  You've got to kick off with a corker, to hold the attention, and then you've got to up it a notch, or cool it a notch. . . oh, there are loads of rules. (pg. 88-9)" -- Nick Hornby]]>

	    <![CDATA["Even though I grew up two hours south, I had rarely ventured to Los Angeles.  I soon learned that my dad wasn't totally off base when he said, &quot;Los Angeles is like San Diego's older, uglier sister that has herpes.&quot;  . . . &quot;Remember.  Family,&quot; he said.  &quot;Also, how do I get back to I-5?  I hate this fucking city." -- Justin Halpern]]>

	    <![CDATA["Eventually, though, I came to the conclusion that I was the male equivalent of a Toyota Camry. You know: No one ever says, &quot;I have to have a Toyota Camry.&quot; But most people who spend some time in a Camry start to like it. &quot;It's pretty reliable,&quot; they think. &quot;It doesn't have a lot of problems, and it's not bad to look at. You know what? I'd probably prefer a nicer car. But I can live with a Camry." -- Justin Halpern]]>
