	    <![CDATA["I agreed. By this time the drink was beginning to cut the acid and my hallucinations were down to a tolerable level.  The room service waiter had a vaguely reptilian cast to his features, but I was no longer seeing huge pterodactyls lumbering around the corridors in pools of fresh blood. The only problem now was a gigantic neon sign outside the window, blocking our view of the mountains -- millions of colored balls running around a very complicated track, strange symbols &amp; filigree, giving off a loud hum....

&quot;Look outside,&quot; I said.

&quot;Why?&quot;

&quot;There's a big ... machine in the sky, ... some kind of electric snake ... coming straight at us.&quot;

&quot;Shoot it,&quot; said my attorney.

&quot;Not yet,&quot; I said. &quot;I want to study its habits." -- Hunter S. Thompson]]>
