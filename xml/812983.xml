		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Linsey pulled away, smiling in a way that would have made him look almost
angelic if it wasn’t for the blood smeared around his mouth. When he licked his lips clean, the angelic image became clearer. Blood welled up from two small cuts on his bottom lip, pooling in the full sweep his skin. I knew it wasn’t just my blood that I’d tasted." -- Cyrese Covelli]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Simple and predictable seem pretty darn tantalizing when you’re a witch.
Lately, I’ve wished for a lot of things to be the way they were. Gone are my lust
for the macabre and the sweetly sinful fantasies of meeting a vampire. Something
about unconscious people slumped against the dark leather of the booths at
crimson made it less sexy." -- Cyrese Covelli]]>

	    <![CDATA["In innocence, she’ll light the fire
And set ablaze the fun’ral pyre
And one shall rise and one shall fall,
By hand of she who’ll lead them all.
Marked twice by beast in time of rage,
And born again as the Wolfsmage.
A house of magic be undone
By she who can remake the sun." -- Cyrese Covelli]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["How do you know me, girl?” He asked, his voice caked with venom. There was movement from the curtains and the throng of vamps seemed to cry out as one, in a sound of pure surprise.
My head turned towards the figure of a young man. He looked like an angel, dressed in white and gold, but whether that was because he caused Petrel to stop or the flickering candlelight from the sconces above us, I couldn’t say." -- Cyrese Covelli]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["You really shouldn’t have come,” Lord Blackthorne said, his hand slipping across my face
to cup my jaw, fingers brushing my cheek. I shrieked, shrinking back and kicking at my captor
with stocking-covered feet. “Such a pretty child, in such an ugly place. Tell me, do you think
your dear husband would mind if I stole a kiss from the bride?”
Kicking him in the shin, I spun, making him release me. I climbed off whatever I’d landed
on, aiming my palms out and wishing that I could see what the heck was happening. Flames
from dozens of candles blinked at me as they lit with the power of my mind. Lord Blackthorne
touched my shoulder, his other hand curving around the bodice of my gown, toying with the
beading along the neckline." -- Cyrese Covelli]]>
