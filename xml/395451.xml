	    <![CDATA["No season lives here.  This space has quite successfully shut out any such interference.  The cunning designer saw to it that there is not even a mirror in which the reader might contemplate his own appearance or anxiously search for the marks of age.  The climate is grammatical.  Nothing here but books, as if I were swaddled in them, as if the porous walls of books were by now almost a second skin.  Or as if they provided a padding like the walls of madhouses, a cushion constructed of the language of the dead." -- Geoffrey O'Brien]]>

	    <![CDATA["That perhaps is your task--to find the relation between things that seem incompatible yet have a mysterious affinity, to absorb every experience that comes your way fearlessly and saturate it completely so that your poem is a whole, not a fragment; to re-think human life into poetry and so give us tragedy again and comedy by means of characters not spun out at length in the novelist's way, but condensed and synthesized in the poet's way--that is what we look to you to do now." -- Virginia Woolf]]>
