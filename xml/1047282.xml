	    <![CDATA["Why is it the songs all end with the good people winning, but in life they don't?&quot;

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Some ideas are not born of logic and good sense. They are made of clouds and cobwebs. They sprout from nowhere and feed on excitement, sprinkled with adventure juice and the sweet flavor of the forbidden. The psyche moves from the realms of the ordinary and takes a delicate step towards the unknown. We know we shouldn't and that is exactly why we do." -- Brigid Lowry]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["There were timelines branching and branching, a mega-universe of universes, millions more every minute. Billions? Trillions? The universe split every time someone made a decision. Split, so that every decision ever made could go both ways. Every choice made by every man, woman, and child was reversed in the universe next door." -- Larry Niven]]>
