	    <![CDATA["And then she thought that you went on living one day after another, and in time you were somebody else, your previous self only like a close relative, a sister or brother, with whom you shared a past.  But a different person, a separate life.  Certainly neither she nor Inman were the people they had been the last time they were together.  And she believed maybe she liked them both better now." -- Charles Frazier]]>
