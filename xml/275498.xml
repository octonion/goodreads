		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Dulce et Decorum Est&quot;
Bent double, like old beggars under sacks, 
Knock-kneed, coughing like hags, we cursed through sludge, 
Till on the haunting flares we turned our backs 
And towards our distant rest began to trudge. 
Men marched asleep. Many had lost their boots 
But limped on, blood-shod. All went lame; all blind; 
Drunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots  
Of tired, outstripped Five-Nines that dropped behind.

Gas! Gas! Quick, boys! – An ecstasy of fumbling, 
Fitting the clumsy helmets just in time; 
But someone still was yelling out and stumbling, 
And flound'ring like a man in fire or lime . . . 
Dim, through the misty panes and thick green light, 
As under a green sea, I saw him drowning. 
In all my dreams, before my helpless sight, 
He plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning. 
If in some smothering dreams you too could pace 
Behind the wagon that we flung him in, 
And watch the white eyes writhing in his face, 
His hanging face, like a devil's sick of sin; 
If you could hear, at every jolt, the blood 
Come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs, 
Obscene as cancer, bitter as the cud  
Of vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues, 
My friend, you would not tell with such high zest 
To children ardent for some desperate glory, 
The old Lie; Dulce et Decorum est 
Pro patria mori" -- Wilfred Owen]]>

	    <![CDATA[https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/427063-civilized-people-must-i-believe-satisfy-the-following-criteria-1]]>
		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Civilized people must, I believe, satisfy the following criteria:

1)  They respect human beings as individuals and are therefore always tolerant, gentle, courteous and amenable ... They do not create scenes over a hammer or a mislaid eraser; they do not make you feel they are conferring a great benefit on you when they live with you, and they don't make a scandal when they leave. (...)

2)  They have compassion for other people besides beggars and cats.  Their hearts suffer the pain of what is hidden to the naked eye. (...)

3)  They respect other people's property, and therefore pay their debts.

4)  They are not devious, and they fear lies as they fear fire.  They don't tell lies even in the most trivial matters.  To lie to someone is to insult them, and the liar is diminished in the eyes of the person he lies to.  Civilized people don't put on airs; they behave in the street as they would at home, they don't show off to impress their juniors. (...)

5)  They don't run themselves down in order to provoke the sympathy of others.  They don't play on other people's heartstrings to be sighed over and cosseted ... that sort of thing is just cheap striving for effects, it's vulgar, old hat and false. (...)

6)  They are not vain.  They don't waste time with the fake jewellery of hobnobbing with celebrities, being permitted to shake the hand of a drunken [judicial orator], the exaggerated bonhomie of the first person they meet at the Salon, being the life and soul of the bar ... They regard prases like 'I am a representative of the Press!!' -- the sort of thing one only hears from [very minor journalists] -- as absurd.  If they have done a brass farthing's work they don't pass it off as if it were 100 roubles' by swanking about with their portfolios, and they don't boast of being able to gain admission to places other people aren't allowed in (...) True talent always sits in the shade, mingles with the crowd, avoids the limelight ... As Krylov said, the empty barrel makes more noise than the full one. (...)

7)  If they do possess talent, they value it ... They take pride in it ... they know they have a responsibility to exert a civilizing influence on [others] rather than aimlessly hanging out with them.  And they are fastidious in their habits. (...)

8)  They work at developing their aesthetic sensibility ... Civilized people don't simply obey their baser instincts ... they require &lt;i&gt;mens sana in corpore sano&lt;/i&gt;.

And so on.  That's what civilized people are like ... Reading &lt;i&gt;Pickwick&lt;/i&gt; and learning a speech from &lt;i&gt;Faust&lt;/i&gt; by heart is not enough if your aim is to become a truly civilized person and not to sink below the level of your surroundings.

[From a letter to Nikolay Chekhov, March 1886]" -- Anton Chekhov]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Our entire society is based on discontent.  People wanting more and more and more. Being constantly dissatisfied with their homes, their bodies, their décor, their clothes, everything – taking it for granted that that’s the whole point of life. Never to be satisfied. If you are perfectly happy with what you got, especially if what you got isn’t even all the spectacular then you’re dangerous. You’re breaking all the rules. You’re undermining the sacred economy. You’re challenging every assumption that society is built on." -- Tana French]]>
