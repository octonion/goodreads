	    <![CDATA["Carmelia Montiel, a twenty-year-old virgin, had just bathed in orange-blossom water and was strewing rosemary leaves on Pilar Ternera's bed when the shot rang out. Aureliano José had been destined to find with her the happiness that Amaranta had denied him, to have seven children, and to die in her arms of old age, but the bullet that entered his back and shattered his chest had been directed by a wrong interpretation of the cards." -- Gabriel García Márquez]]>

	    <![CDATA["Do you think that people ever really do believe they will die, that the world will just go along as always without them? I wonder if we aren't all a little surprised at the moment of crossover, if we don't look back over our shoulders saying, Now hold on." -- Elizabeth Berg]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["You do admit that, if wealth was divided up equally, in a few years there would be rich and poor again just the same.  The hard-working man would come to the top, the wastrel sink to the bottom.
- Every one admits that.
- Your Socialists don't.
- My Socialists do.  Yours mayn't; but I strongly suspect yours of being not Socialists, but ninepins, which you have constructed for your own amusement.  I can't imagine any living creature who would bowl over quite so easily." -- E.M. Forster]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["This pause in time, within time ... When did I first experience the exquisite sense of surrender that is only possible with another person?  The peace of mind one experiences on one's own, one's certainty of self in the serenity of solitude, are nothing in comparison to the release and openness and fluency one shares with another, in close companionship ..." -- Muriel Barbery]]>
