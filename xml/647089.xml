I wish it wasn’t." -- Elizabeth Scott]]>

	    <![CDATA["In the first century CE, Roman authorities punished St. Apollonia by crushing her teeth one by one with pliers.

But it never stops hurting." -- John Green]]>

	    <![CDATA["I still love books. Nothing a computer can do can compare to a book. You can't really put a book on the Internet. Three companies have offered to put books by me on the Net, and I said, 'If you can make something that has a nice jacket, nice paper with that nice smell, then we'll talk.' All the computer can give you is a manuscript. People don't want to read manuscripts. They want to read books. Books smell good. They look good. You can press it to your bosom. You can carry it in your pocket." -- Ray Bradbury]]>
