	    <![CDATA["People always say it's harder to heal a wounded heart than a wounded body.  Bullshit.  It's exactly the opposite—a wounded body takes much longer to heal.  A wounded heart is nothing but ashes of memories.  But the body is everything.  The body is blood and veins and cells and nerves.  A wounded body is when, after leaving a man you’ve lived with for three years, you curl up on your side of the bed as if there’s still somebody beside you.  That is a wounded body:  a body that feels connected to someone who is no longer there." -- Xiaolu Guo]]>
