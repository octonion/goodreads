		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Grimalkin sighed loudly, causing me to look back and Razor to hiss at him. “Am I the only one here who has any insight at all?” he said, looking to each of our faces. We stared at him, and he shook his head. “Drawing a blank, are you? Think about what you just said, human. Repeat that last phrase, if you would.”
I frowned. “Isn’t that where you want to be?”
He closed his eyes. “The next phrase, human.”
“With all the other gremlins.” He stared at me expectantly, and I raised my hands. “What? What are you getting at, Grim?”
Grimalkin thumped his tail. “It is times like these I am ever more grateful that I am a cat,” he sighed. “Why do you think I brought you that creature, human? To keep up my stalking skills? I assure you, they are quite adequate already. Please attempt to use the brain I know is hidden somewhere in that head." -- Julie Kagawa]]>
