	    <![CDATA["Yelena, you've driven me crazy. You've caused me considerable trouble and I've contemplated ending your life twice since I've known you.&quot; Valek's warm breath in my ear sent a shiver down my spine.

&quot;But you’ve slipped under my skin, invaded my blood and seized my heart.”

“That sounds more like a poison than a person,” was all I could say. His confession had both shocked and thrilled me.

“Exactly,” Valek replied. “You have poisoned me." -- Maria V. Snyder]]>

	    <![CDATA["I am a Stormdancer! Mere metal is nothing compared with the power of a storm.&quot; Kade made his voice boom and spread his arms wide. His eyes sparked with humor. &quot;I. Am. Invincible.&quot;
&quot;Until a happy wind blows,&quot; I said.
&quot;Curse those sunny days.&quot;
&quot;The bane of your existence.&quot;
&quot;The scourge of society.&quot;
&quot;The downfall of decency.&quot;
&quot;And boring, too. Nothing like a good gale to put a spring in your step.&quot; Kade grinned." -- Maria V. Snyder]]>

	    <![CDATA["I believe that everything happens for a reason. People change so that you can learn to let go, things go wrong so that you appreciate them when they're right, you believe lies so you eventually learn to trust no one but yourself, and sometimes good things fall apart so better things can fall together." -- Marilyn Monroe]]>
