		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Unlike Rosa, I can see no divine purpose behind the tangle of this existence, no ordering hand.  It is all a mystery, or more accurately, a mess.  There are no heroes or villains, no saviors or demons or angels.  Only those who have died and those of us who, for whatever reason, have survived.  None of this will keep me from believing in God.  I believe in Him, I just don't know that I will ever have faith in Him." -- Brady Udall]]>

Not all those who wander are lost;

Deep roots are not reached by the frost.

A light from the shadows shall spring;
Renewed shall be blade that was broken,
The crownless again shall be king." -- J.R.R. Tolkien]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do." -- Apple Computer Inc.]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["He has achieved success who has lived well, laughed often, and loved much;
Who has enjoyed the trust of pure women, the respect of intelligent men and the love of little children;
Who has filled his niche and accomplished his task;
Who has never lacked appreciation of Earth's beauty or failed to express it;
Who has left the world better than he found it,
Whether an improved poppy, a perfect poem, or a rescued soul;
Who has always looked for the best in others and given them the best he had;
Whose life was an inspiration;
Whose memory a benediction." -- Bessie Anderson Stanley]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["You have to take risks, he said. We will only understand the miracle of life fully when we allow the unexpected to happen. Every day, God gives us the sun--and also one moment in which we have the ability to change everything that makes us unhappy. Every day, we try to pretend that we haven't perceived that moment, that it doesn't exist--that today is the same as yesterday and will be the same as tomorrow. But if people really pay attention to their everyday lives, they will discover that magic moment. It may arrive in the instant when we are doing something mundane, like putting our front-door key in the lock; it may lie hidden in the quiet that follows the lunch hour or in the thousand and one things that all seem the same to us. But that moment exists--a moment when all the power of the stars becomes a part of us and enables us to perform miracles." -- Paulo Coelho]]>

	    <![CDATA["She was gone, and all that was left was the space you'd grown around her, like a tree that grows around a fence.  For a long time, it remained hollow.  Years, maybe.  And when at last it was filled again, you knew that the new love you felt for a woman would have been impossible without Alma.  If it weren't for her, there would never have been an empty space, or the need to fill it." -- Nicole Krauss]]>
