	    <![CDATA["We women have lived too much with closure: &quot;If he notices me, if I marry him, if I get into college, if I get this work accepted, if I get this job&quot; -- there always seems to loom the possibility of something being over, settled, sweeping clear the way for contentment. This is the delusion of a passive life. When the hope for closure is abandoned, when there is an end to fantasy, adventure for women will begin." -- Carolyn G. Heilbrun]]>

	    <![CDATA["The moral test of government is how that government treats those who are in the dawn of life, the children; those who are in the twilight of life, the elderly; and those who are in shadows of life, the sick, the needy, and the handicapped." -- Hubert H. Humphrey]]>
