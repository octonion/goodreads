	    <![CDATA["When God had made The Man, he made him out of stuff that sung all the time and glittered all over. Some angels got jealous and chopped him into millions of pieces, but still he glittered and hummed. So they beat him down to nothing but sparks but each little spark had a shine and a song. So they covered each one over with mud. And the lonesomeness in the sparks make them hunt for one another." -- Zora Neale Hurston]]>

	    <![CDATA["Because it is the lot of mothers to remember what no one else cares to, Mrs. Dutta thinks.  To tell them over and over until they are lodged, perforce, in family lore.  We are the keepers of the heart's dusty corners." -- Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni]]>

	    <![CDATA["This [oatmeal] represents your soul in its pure state.  Your soul on the day you were born.  You were perfect.  You were happy.  You were good.
Now, enter Concept Number Two: crap.  Don't worry, folks.  I don't use actual crap up here.  Only imaginary crap.  You'll have to supply the crap, using your mind.  Now, if someone came up and crapped in your nice warm oatmeal, what would you say?  Would you say: 'Wow, super, thanks, please continue crapping in my oatmeal'?  Am I being silly?  I'm being a little silly.  But guess what, in real life people come up and crap in your oatmeal all the time--friends, co-workers, loved ones, even you kids, especially your kids!--and that's exactly what you do. You say, 'Thanks so much!' You say, 'Crap away!' You say, and here the metaphor breaks down a bit, 'Is there some way I can help you crap in my oatmeal?" -- George Saunders]]>
