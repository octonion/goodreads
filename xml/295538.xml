	    <![CDATA["Prime numbers are what is left when you have taken all the patterns away. I think prime numbers are like life. They are very logical but you could never work out the rules, even if you spent all your time thinking about them." -- Mark Haddon]]>

	    <![CDATA["You could say that Elphaba brought us together,' said Boq softly.  'I'm closer to her and so I'm closer to you.'

Galinda seemed to give up.  She leaned her head back on the velvet cushions of the swing and said, 'Boq, you know despite myself I think you're a little sweet.  You're a little sweet and you're a little charming and you're a little maddening and you're a little habit-forming.'

Boq held his breath.

But you're little!' she concluded.  'You're a Munchkin, for god's sake!'

He kissed her, he kissed her, he kissed her, little by little by little." -- Gregory Maguire]]>

	    <![CDATA["She dropped her shyness like a nightgown, and in the liquid glare of sunlight on old boards she held up her hands-as if, in the terror of the upcoming skirmish, she had at last understood that she was beautiful. In her own way." -- Gregory Maguire]]>
