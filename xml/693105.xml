	    <![CDATA["1492. As children we were taught to memorize this year with pride and joy as the year people began living full and imaginative lives on the continent of North America. Actually, people had been living full and imaginative lives on the continent of North America for hundreds of years before that. 1492 was simply the year sea pirates began to rob, cheat, and kill them." -- Kurt Vonnegut]]>

	    <![CDATA["In the beginning, God created the earth, and he looked upon it in his cosmic loneliness.

And God said, &quot;Let Us make living creatures out of mud, so the mud can see what We have done.&quot; And God created every living creature that now moveth, and one was man. Mud as man alone could speak. God leaned close to mud as man sat, looked around, and spoke. &quot;What is the purpose of all this?&quot; he asked politely.

&quot;Everything must have a purpose?&quot; asked God.

&quot;Certainly,&quot; said man.

&quot;Then I leave it to you to think of one for all this,&quot; said God.

And He went away." -- Kurt Vonnegut]]>

	    <![CDATA["When the last living thing
Has died on account of us,
How poetical it would be
If Earth could say,
In a voice floating up
Perhaps
From the floor
Of the Grand Canyon,
&quot;It is done.&quot;
People did not like it here." -- Kurt Vonnegut]]>
