	    <![CDATA["His Majesty needs a can-I girl anyway. And I’m not it.”
“A can-I girl?” Andrea frowned.
I leaned back. “ ‘ Can I fetch you your food, Your Majesty? Can I tell you how strong and mighty you are, Your Majesty? Can I pick out your fleas, Your Majesty? Can I kiss your ass, Your Majesty? Can I...”
It dawned on me that Raphael was sitting very still. Frozen, like a statue, his gaze fixed on the point above my head.
“He’s standing behind me, isn’t he?”
Andrea nodded slowly.
“Technically it should be ‘may I,’” Curran said, his voice deeper than I remembered. “Since you’re asking permission." -- Ilona Andrews]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I surveyed the rest of the Council and looked directly at Mahon. “Some of you know me. Some of you have seen me fight and some of you are my friends. Have your vote. But know this: if you come to remove me, come in force, because if you try to separate me from him, I will kill every single one of you. My hand won't shake. My aim won't falter. My face will be the last thing you‟ll see before you die.”

I jammed the knife into the table and walked out." -- Ilona Andrews]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["There are infinite numbers between 0 and 1. There's .1 and .12 and .112 and an infinite collection of others. Of course, there is a bigger infinite set of numbers between 0 and 2, or between 0 and a million. Some infinities are bigger than other infinities. A writer we used to like taught us that. There are days, many of them, when I resent the size of my unbounded set. I want more numbers than I'm likely to get, and God, I want more numbers for Augustus Waters than he got. But, Gus, my love, I cannot tell you how thankful I am for our little infinity. I wouldn't trade it for the world. You gave me a forever within the numbered days, and I'm grateful." -- John Green]]>

	    <![CDATA["May I see you again?&quot; he asked.  There was an endearing nervousness in his voice.  

I smiled.  &quot;Sure.&quot;

&quot;Tomorrow?&quot; he asked.

&quot;Patience, grasshopper,&quot; I counseled.  &quot;You don't want to seem overeager.  

&quot;Right, that's why I said tomorrow,&quot; he said.  &quot;I want to see you again tonight.  But I'm willing to wait all night and much of tomorrow.&quot;  I rolled my eyes.  &quot;I'm serious,&quot; he said.  

&quot;You don't even know me,&quot; I said.  I grabbed the book from the center console.  &quot;How about I call you when I finish this?&quot;

&quot;But you don't even have my phone number,&quot; he said.

&quot;I strongly suspect you wrote it in this book.&quot; 

He broke out into that goofy smile.  &quot;And you say we don't know each other." -- John Green]]>
