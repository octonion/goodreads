	    <![CDATA["And when the event, the big change in your life, is simply an insight—isn't that a strange thing? That absolutely nothing changes except that you see things differently and you're less fearful and less anxious and generally stronger as a result: isn't it amazing that a completely invisible thing in your head can feel realer than anything you've experienced before? You see things more clearly and you &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt; that you're seeing them more clearly.  And it comes to you that this is what it means to love life, this is all anybody who talks seriously about God is ever talking about.  Moments like this." -- Jonathan Franzen]]>

	    <![CDATA["Murray said, ´I don´t trust anybody´s nostalgia but my own.  Nostalgia is a product of dissatisfaction and rage.  It´s a settling of grievances between the present and the past.  The more powerful the nostalgia, the closer you come to violence.  War is the form nostalgia takes when men are hard-pressed to say something good about their country.´" -- Don DeLillo]]>
