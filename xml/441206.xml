	    <![CDATA["I know he's not stupid,&quot; Julian whispered in a stricken voice. &quot;He's not...he's not one of us, just like you said. he's the kind of man who if you gave him a gun and two choices--shoot one of your dogs or shoot yourself in the head--he'd put the gun to his ear and pull the trigger.&quot;

&quot;Hell, Jules, you'd do the same thing if someone did that to your and your goddamned cats,&quot; Blake said in amusement. 

&quot;No,&quot; Julian murmured with a shake of his head. &quot;No there's a third option. People like us, we're third-option people. We take the gun, stuff it in the person's mouth, and eliminate the problem. Walk off into the sunset with our kitty." -- Abigail Roux]]>

	    <![CDATA["You ever get gut feelings? Like you see something and just know?' Ty asked, feeling stupid but not caring. He felt Zane squeeze his hand. &quot;First time I saw you, after I got over hating you, I knew, I knew we'd die together. I could just feel it deep down.'

Zane exhaled heavily. 'Not today. And not tomorrow. And not for a long time to come, Ty Grady. You hear me? A hell of a long time.'

Ty nodded jerkily...

...Several heartbeats of quiet passed before Zane spoke. 'First time I saw you, after i got over hating you, I knew,' he said echoing Ty's words, 'I knew I'd fall in love with you...I laughed at myself,' Zane cotinued, a hint of pleading in his voice, 'and then I denied it, and then I did everything I could to prove myself wrong, but it didn't work...Ty,' Zane's even, soothing tones finally broke on the short gasp of his name. 'I love you and I'm scared I'll lose you. Please don't leave me a lone in the dark." -- Abigail Roux]]>

	    <![CDATA["The front door flew open, and Mary shot out of the house, jumping off the porch, not even bothering with the steps to the ground. She ran over the frost-laden grass in her bare feet and threw herself at him, grabbing on to his neck with both arms. She held him so tightly his spine cracked.

She was sobbing. Bawling. Crying so hard her whole body was shaking.

He didn't ask any questions, just wrapped himself around her.

I'm not okay,&quot; she said hoarsely between breaths.  &quot;Rhage...I'm not okay." -- J.R. Ward]]>

He glanced back down at the pencil in his hand and then turned to the table. Flipping the spiral notebook to a new page, he bent way over and labored on top of the paper for quite a while. Then he ripped the sheet free.

His hand was shaking as he held it out. &quot;It's messy.&quot;

Bella took the paper. In a child's uneven block letters there were three words: I LOVE YOU

Her lips flattened tight as her eyes stung. The handwriting got wavy and then disappeared.
 
&quot;Maybe you can't read it,&quot; he said in a small voice. &quot;I can do it over.&quot;
 
She shook her head. &quot;I can read it just fine. It's… beautiful.&quot;

&quot;I don't expect anything back. I mean… I know that you don't… feel that for me anymore. But I wanted you to know. It's important that you knew." -- J.R. Ward]]>
