	    <![CDATA["I pulled the MG in beside him at the curb and he got in.
&quot;This thing ain't big enough for either one of us,&quot; he said. &quot;When you getting something that fits?&quot;
&quot;It goes with my preppy look,&quot; I said.  &quot;You get one of these, they let you drive around the north shore, watch polo, anything you want.&quot;
I let the clutch in and turned right on Dartmouth.
&quot;How you get laid in one of these?&quot; Hawk said.
&quot;You just don't understand preppy,&quot; I said. &quot;I know it's not your fault. You're only a couple generations out of the jungle. I realize that. But if you're preppy you don't get laid in a car.&quot;
&quot;Where do you get laid if you preppy?&quot;
I sniffed. &quot;One doesn't,&quot; I said.
&quot;Preppies gonna be outnumbered in a while,&quot; Hawk said." -- Robert B. Parker]]>
