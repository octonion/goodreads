I never learn." -- Patricia Marx]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Hallucinations are bad enough.  But after awhile you learn to cope with things like seeing your dead grandmother crawling up your leg with a knife in her teeth.  Most acid fanciers can handle this sort of thing.  But nobody can handle that other trip-the possibility that any freak with $1.98 can walk into the Circus-Circus and suddenly appear in the sky over downtown Las Vegas twelve times the size of God, howling anything that comes into his head.  No, this is not a good town for psychedelic drugs." -- Hunter S. Thompson]]>

If you drop one of these, it will be irrevocably scuffed, nicked, perhaps even shattered." -- James Patterson]]>
