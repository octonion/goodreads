	    <![CDATA["Be ruthless about protecting writing days, i.e., do not cave in to endless requests to have &quot;essential&quot; and &quot;long overdue&quot; meetings on those days.  The funny thing is that, although writing has been my actual job for several years now, I still seem to have to fight for time in which to do it.  Some people do not seem to grasp that I still have to sit down in peace and write the books, apparently believing that they pop up like mushrooms without my connivance.  I must therefore guard the time allotted to writing as a Hungarian Horntail guards its firstborn egg." -- J.K. Rowling]]>
