	    <![CDATA["Please stop patronizing those who are reading a book - The Da Vinci Code, maybe- because they are enjoying it.  For a start, none of us know what kind of an effort this represents for the individual reader.  It could be his or her first full-length adult novel; it might be the book that finally reveals the purpose and joy of reading to someone who has hitherto been mystified by the attraction books exert on others.  And anyway, reading for enjoyment is what we should all be doing.  I don't mean we should all be reading chick lit or thrillers (although if that's what you want to read, it's fine by me, because here's something no one else will tell you: if you don't read the classics, or the novel that won this year's Booker Prize, then nothing bad will happen to you; more importantly,nothing good will happen to you if you do); I simply mean that turning pages should not be like walking through thick mud.  The whole purpose of books is that we read them, and if you find you can't, it might not be your inadequacy that's to blame.  &quot;Good&quot; books can be pretty awful sometimes." -- Nick Hornby]]>
