		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The truly creative mind in any field is no more than this: A human creature born abnormally, inhumanly sensitive. To him... a touch is a blow, a sound is a noise, a misfortune is a tragedy, a joy is an ecstasy, a friend is a lover, a lover is a god, and failure is death. Add to this cruelly delicate organism the overpowering necessity to create, create, create -- so that
without the creating of music or poetry or books or buildings or something of meaning, his very breath is cut off from him. He must create, must pour out creation. By some strange, unknown, inward urgency he is not really alive unless he is creating." -- Pearl S. Buck]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["A mature person is one who does not think only in absolutes, who is able to be objective even when deeply stirred emotionally, who has learned that there is both good and bad in all people and in all things, and who walks humbly and deals charitably with the circumstances of life, knowing that in this world no one is all knowing and therefore all of us need both love and charity." -- Eleanor Roosevelt]]>

	    <![CDATA["Without books the development of civilization would have been impossible.  They are the engines of change, windows on the world, &quot;Lighthouses&quot; as the poet said &quot;erected in the sea of time.&quot; They are companions, teachers, magicians, bankers of the treasures of the mind, Books are humanity in print." -- Arthur Schopenhauer]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I felt no shame in these activities, because I understood what almost no one else seemed to grasp: that there was only an infinitesimal difference, a difference so small that it barely existed except as a figment of the human imagination, between working in a tall green glass building on Park Avenue and collecting litter in a park. In fact, there may have been no difference at all." -- Jennifer Egan]]>
