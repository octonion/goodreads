	    <![CDATA["And I just couldn't take it anymore. I closed the distance between us, slammed him back against the chair and kissed him, holding his head still with both my hands buried in that stupid, stupid hair. I half expected more resistance, because Pritkin had never met an argument he didn't like. So it was a shock when he ran his hands down my sides, cupped my hips and slid us both to the floor.
&quot;I'm going straight to hell for this,&quot; he muttered.
&quot;At least you'll know a lot of people,&quot; I said breathlessly. " -- Karen Chance]]>
