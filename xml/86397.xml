	    <![CDATA["When Švejk subsequently described life in the lunatic asylum, he did so in exceptionally eulogistic terms: 'I really don't know why those loonies get so angry when they're kept there.  You can crawl naked on the floor, howl like a jackal, rage and bite.  If anyone did this anywhere on the promenade people would be astonished, but there it's the most common or garden thing to do.  There's a freedom there which not even Socialists have ever dreamed of." -- Jaroslav Hašek]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Tell a wise person, or else keep silent,
because the mass man will mock it right away.
I praise what is truly alive,
what longs to be burned to death.

In the calm water of the love-nights,
where you were begotten, where you have begotten,
a strange feeling comes over you,
when you see the silent candle burning.

Now you are no longer caught
in the obsession with darkness,
and a desire for higher love-making
sweeps you upward.

Distance does not make you falter.
Now, arriving in magic, flying,
and finally, insane for the light,
you are the butterfly and you are gone.

And so long as you haven't experienced 
this: to die and so to grow,
you are only a troubled guest
on the dark earth." -- Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["In my own worst seasons I've come back from the colorless world of despair by forcing myself to look hard, for a long time, at a single glorious thing: a flame of red geranium outside my bedroom window. And then another: my daughter in a yellow dress. And another: the perfect outline of a full, dark sphere behind the crescent moon. Until I learned to be in love with my life again. Like a stroke victim retraining new parts of the brain to grasp lost skills, I have taught myself joy, over and over again(15)." -- Barbara Kingsolver]]>
