	    <![CDATA["No,&quot; the Boss (Willie) corrected, &quot;I'm not a lawyer.  I know some law. In fact, I know a lot of law.  And I made me some money out of law.  That's why I can see what the law is like.  It's like a single-bed blanket on a double bed and three folks in the bed and a cold night.  There ain't ever enough blanket to cover the case, no matter how much pulling and hauling, and somebody is always going to nigh catch pneumonia.  Hell, the law is like the pants you bought last year for a growing boy, but it is always this year and the seams are popped and the shankbone's to the breeze. The law is too short and too tight for growing humankind.  The best you can do is do something and then make up some law to fit and by the time that law gets onto the books you would have done something different...&quot;  Willie Stark; All the King's Men" -- Robert Penn Warren]]>
