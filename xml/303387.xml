	    <![CDATA["- Why are you drinking? - the little prince asked.
- In order to forget - replied the drunkard.
- To forget what? - enquired the little prince, who was already feeling sorry for him.
- To forget that I am ashamed - the drunkard confessed, hanging his head.
- Ashamed of what? - asked the little prince who wanted to help him.

'Grown-ups really are very, very odd', he said to himself as he continued his journey." -- Antoine de Saint-Exupéry]]>
