	    <![CDATA["People travel to wonder 
at the height of the mountains, 
at the huge waves of the seas,
at the long course of the rivers,
at the vast compass of the ocean,
at the circular motion of the stars,
and yet they pass by themselves 
without wondering. " -- Saint Augustine]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["It is interesting that Hindus, when they speak of the creation of the universe  do not call it the work of God, they call it the play of God, the Vishnu lila, lila meaning  play.  And they look upon the whole manifestation of all the universes as a play, as a sport, as a kind of dance â€” lila perhaps being somewhat related to our word lilt" -- Alan Watts]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["You know, if we understand one question rightly, all questions are answered. But we don't know how to ask the right question. To ask the right question demands a great deal of intelligence and sensitivity. Here is a question, a fundamental question: is life a torture? It is, as it is; and man has lived in this torture centuries upon centuries, from ancient history to the present day, in agony, in despair, in sorrow; and he doesn't find a way out of it. Therefore he invents gods, churches, all the rituals, and all that nonsense, or he escapes in different ways. What we are trying to do, during all these discussions and talks here, is to see if we cannot radically bring about a transformation of the mind, not accept things as they are, nor revolt against them. Revolt doesn't answer a thing. You must understand it, go into it, examine it, give your heart and your mind, with everything that you have, to find out a way of living differently. That depends on you, and not on someone else, because in this there is no teacher, no pupil; there is no leader; there is no guru; there is no Master, no Saviour. You yourself are the teacher and the pupil; you are the Master; you are the guru; you are the leader; you are everything. And to understand is to transform what is. 

I think that will be enough, won't it?" -- Jiddu Krishnamurti]]>
