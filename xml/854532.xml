	    <![CDATA["I wonder if God cries. Or gets sad, even. Or happy. Or elated. Does he ever have a good belly laugh? Does he sense contentment? Does he feel pride or remorse? Is he stoic? We know from the Old Testament that he experiences bloodthirsty, murderous rage and fierce pride. He imbued mankind with all of these emotions, but it's hard to imagine him feeling any of these. It's almost a little embarrassing to think of him feeling jealousy. Of course he's WAY more advanced and evolved than we are. So I guess the ultimate stage of humanity is when we don't laugh or cry or experience emotion at all. God gave us laughter as a constant remind of what lesser-evolved beings humans are. Stupid humans!" -- David Cross]]>

	    <![CDATA["Trinity’s witnesses responded just as those to Apollo 11 would, as J. Robert Oppenheimer remembered: &quot;We knew the world would not be the same. A few people laughed, a few people cried, most people were silent.&quot; Oppenheimer later said the he beheld his radiant blooming cloud and thought of Hindu scripture: &quot;Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.&quot; Aloud, however, the physicist made the ultimate engineer comment: &quot;It worked." -- Craig Nelson]]>
