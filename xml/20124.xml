	    <![CDATA["Virginia Woolf wrote, &quot;Across the broad continent of a woman's life falls the shadow of a sword.&quot; On one side of that sword, she said, there lies convention and tradition and order, where all is correct.  But on the other side of that sword, if you're crazy enough to cross it and choose a life that does not follow convention, &quot;all is confusion.&quot;  Nothing follows a regular course.  Her argument was that the crossing of the shadow of that sword may bring a more interesting existence to a woman, but you can bet it will be more perilous." -- Elizabeth Gilbert]]>

You must make a mighty effort to keep swimming upward into that happiness forever, to stay afloat on top of it." -- Elizabeth Gilbert]]>
