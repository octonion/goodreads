&quot;No.  But I have incredible luck with dice and I am ruthless.  You will lose, gentlemen.  I will destroy your lands, take your women, ravish your men, and make your children my slave labor.  I will own every castle, house, and farm that is within my reach.  I won't be satisfied until I own all of it and you.  I will destroy you all, gentlemen, and, to be quite blunt, I don't think you can handle it.&quot;
Van covered his mouth to keep from laughing out loud and he didn't dare look at his sister.  Verner stepped back, motioning to the table.  &quot;Now I must insist.&quot;
&quot;As you wish.&quot;  Irene sighed and stood.  She glanced at Van and gave him a quick wink before turning back to his uncle.  &quot;I do hope you're a 'sobber,' Mr. Van Holtz.  Nothing I love more than the lamenting of the men I annihilate.&quot;

&quot;I can't believe you made him cry.&quot;
&quot;I did not.  He just teared up a little.&quot;
&quot;Yeah.  I think it was when you told him, 'I now control your ports and own your manhood.'&quot;
&quot;His wife laughed." -- Shelly Laurenston]]>
