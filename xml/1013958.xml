		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Being a geek is all about being honest about what you enjoy and not being afraid to demonstrate that affection. It means never having to play it cool about how much you like something. Itâ€™s basically a license to proudly emote on a somewhat childish level rather than behave like a supposed adult. Being a geek is extremely liberating." -- Simon Pegg]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Why do you lie with your legs ungainly huddled,
And one arm bent across your sullen cold
Exhausted face? It hurts my heart to watch you,
Deep-shadow'd from the candle's guttering gold;
And you wonder why I shake you by the shoulder;
Drowsy, you mumble and sigh and turn your head....
&lt;i&gt;You are too young to fall asleep for ever;
And when you sleep you remind me of the dead.&lt;/i&gt;" -- Siegfried Sassoon]]>
