		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Few would argue against safe-guarding the nation.  But in the judgment of at least one of the country's most distinguished presidential scholars, the legal steps taken by the Bush Administration in its war against terrorism were a quantum leap beyond earlier blots on the country's history and traditions: more significant than John Adams' Alien and Sedition Acts, than Lincoln's suspension of habeas corpus during the Civil War, than the imprisonment of Americans of Japanese descent during World War II.  Collectively, Arthur Schlesinger Jr. argued, the Bush Administration's extralegal counter-terrorism program presented the most dramatic, sustained, and radical challenge to the rule of law in American history." -- Jane Mayer]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Useless pursuits and conversations always about the same things absorb the better part of one's time, the better part of one's strength, and in the end there is left a life grovelling and curtailed, worthless and trivial, and there is no escaping or getting away from itâ€”just as though one were in a madhouse or prison." -- Anton Chekhov]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["They held the funeral on the second day, with the town coming to look at Miss Emily beneath a mass of bought flowers with the crayon face of her father musing profoundly above the bier and the ladies sibilant and macabre; and the very old men - some in their brushed Confederate uniforms - on the porch and the lawn, talking of Miss Emily as if she had been a contemporary of theirs, believing that they had danced with her and courted her perhaps, confusing time with its mathematical progression, as the old do, to whom all the past is not a diminishing road but, instead, a huge meadow which no winter ever quite touches, divided from them now by the narrow bottle-neck of the most recent decade of years." -- William Faulkner]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["That my lunacy had been recognized was chastening enough, but the judge's gratuitous &quot;fatuous&quot; carried with it intimations that I was in a blubbering, nose-picking state; an I had visions of arriving at my mother's door, garbed not in the &quot;attractive,&quot; melancholic dementia of the poet but in the drooling, masturbatory, moony-eyed condition of the Mongoloid." -- Frederick Exley]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I distrust summaries, any kind of gliding through time, any too great a claim that one is in control of what one recounts; I think someone who claims to understand but who is obviously calm, someone who claims to write with emotion recollected in tranquility, is a fool and a liar.  To understand is to tremble.  To recollect is to reenter and be riven.  An acrobat after spinning through the air in a mockery of flight stands erect on his perch and mockingly takes his bow as if what he is being applauded for was easy for him and cost him nothing, although meanwhile he is covered with sweat and his smile is edged with a relief chilling to think about; he is indulging in a show-business style; he is pretending to be superhuman.  I am bored with that and with here it has brought us.  I admire the authority of being on one's knees in front of the event.
- Innocence, from My Mistress's Sparrow is Dead" -- Harold Brodkey]]>

So all right.  Weâ€™re back where we started.  To you, nothing â€“ from you, everything.  They took it from me, it seems, for no reason, other than that I value it so much." -- Martin Amis]]>

	    <![CDATA["Iâ€™m sitting in the prow-shaped dining room of a tourist steamer, the Georgi Zhukov, on the Yenisei River, which flows from the foothills of Mongolia to the Arctic Ocean, thus cleaving the northern Eurasian plain â€“ a distance of some two and a half thousand versts.  Given Russian distances, and the general arduousness of Russian life, youâ€™d expect a verst to be the equivalent of â€“ I donâ€™t know â€“ thirty-nine miles.  In fact itâ€™s barely more than a kilometer." -- Martin Amis]]>
