	    <![CDATA["O how all things are far removed 
and long have passed away. 
I do believe the star, 
whose light my face reflects, 
is dead and has been so 
for many thousand years. 

I had a vision of a passing boat 
and heard some voices saying disquieting things. 
I heard a clock strike in some distant house... 
but in which house?... 

I long to quiet my anxious heart 
and stand beneath the sky's immensity. 
I long to pray... 
And one of all the stars 
must still exist. 
I do believe that I would know 
which one alone 
endured, 
and which like a white city stands 
at the ray's end shining in the heavens. " -- Rilke Rainer Maria]]>
