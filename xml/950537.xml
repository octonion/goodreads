To summarize: it is a well-known fact that those people who must &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; to rule people are, ipso facto, those least suited to do it. 
To summarize the summary: anyone who is capable of getting themselves made President should on no account be allowed to do the job." -- Douglas Adams]]>

	    <![CDATA["Black bears rarely attack. But here's the thing. Sometimes they do. All bears are agile, cunning and immensely strong, and they are always hungry. If they want to kill you and eat you, they can, and pretty much whenever they want. That doesn't happen often, but - and here is the absolutely salient point - once would be enough." -- Bill Bryson]]>

	    <![CDATA["Life is truly a ride.  We're all strapped in and no one can stop it.  When the doctor slaps your behind, he's ripping your ticket and away you go.

I think the most you can hope for at the end of life is that your hair's messed, you're out of breath, and you didn't throw up." -- Jerry Seinfeld]]>
