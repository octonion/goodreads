	    <![CDATA["All that is gold does not glitter,
Not all those who wander are lost;
The old that is strong does not wither,
Deep roots are not reached by the frost.

From the ashes a fire shall be woken,
A light from the shadows shall spring;
Renewed shall be blade that was broken,
The crownless again shall be king." -- J.R.R. Tolkien]]>

	    <![CDATA["The Road goes ever on and on
Down from the door where it began.
Now far ahead the Road has gone,
And I must follow, if I can,
Pursuing it with eager feet,
Until it joins some larger way
Where many paths and errands meet.
And whither then? I cannot say" -- J.R.R. Tolkien]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["It's not about surviving.  It should be about love.  When you know love...that's what makes this life worth it.  When you live with it everyday.  Wake up with it, hold on to it during the thunder and after a nightmare.  When love is your refuge from the death that surrounds us all and when it fills you so tight that you can't express it." -- Carrie Ryan]]>

&quot;I could find another one,&quot; Basil says.
&quot;No, I want to see if they'll I through with it,&quot; she says.
&quot;I don't understand why they're throwing her in the volcano,&quot; I say.
&quot;Because she's a virgin,&quot; Basil says, and clears his throat.
&quot;We could throw Morgan into the volcano,&quot; Pen says." -- Lauren Destefano ]]>
