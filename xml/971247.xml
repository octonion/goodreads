	    <![CDATA["Let us find the dam snack bar,&quot; Zoe said. &quot;We should eat while we can.&quot;
Grover cracked a smile. &quot;The dam snack bar?&quot;
Zoe blinked. &quot;Yes. What is funny?&quot;
&quot;Nothing,&quot; Grover said, trying to keep a straight face. &quot;I could use some dam french fries.&quot;
Even Thalia smiled at that. &quot;And I need to use the dam restroom.&quot;
...
I started cracking up, and Thalia and Grover joined in, while Zoe just looked at me. &quot;I do not understand.&quot;
&quot;I want to use the dam water fountain,&quot; Grover said.
&quot;And...&quot; Thalia tried to catch her breath. &quot;I want to buy a dam t-shirt." -- Rick Riordan]]>
