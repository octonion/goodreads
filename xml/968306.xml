		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The best thing for being sad,&quot; replied Merlin, beginning to puff and blow, &quot;is to learn something. That's the only thing that never fails. You may grow old and trembling in your anatomies, you may lie awake at night listening to the disorder of your veins, you may miss your only love, you may see the world about you devastated by evil lunatics, or know your honour trampled in the sewers of baser minds. There is only one thing for it then — to learn. Learn why the world wags and what wags it. That is the only thing which the mind can never exhaust, never alienate, never be tortured by, never fear or distrust, and never dream of regretting. Learning is the only thing for you. Look what a lot of things there are to learn." -- T.H. White]]>

	    <![CDATA["It is a pity that there are no big creatures to prey on humanity. If there were enough dragons and rocs, perhaps mankind would turn its might against them. Unfortunately man is preyed upon by microbes, which are too small to be appreciated." -- T.H. White]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Multiple species, with multiple viewpoints and racial philosophies, simply cannot hold power together for long.  The dominant voice must certainly be wise enough to adopt ideas and methods from its allies and member peoples.  But there must &lt;i&gt;be&lt;/i&gt; a dominant voice, or there is only chaos.  In this part of the galaxy, that voice is the Empire.&quot;

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Nationalism is our form of incest, is our idolatry, is our
insanity. 'Patriotism' is its cult...  Just as love for one
individual which excludes the love for others is not love,
love for one's country which is not part of one's love
for humanity is not love, but idolatrous worship." -- Erich Fromm]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain." -- Frank Herbert]]>
