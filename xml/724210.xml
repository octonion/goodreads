	    <![CDATA["We're always thinking of eternity as an idea that cannot be understood, something immense. But why must it be? What if, instead of all this, you suddenly find just a little room there, something like a village bath-house, grimy, and spiders in every corner, and that's all eternity is.  Sometimes, you know, I can't help feeling that that's what it is." -- Fyodor Dostoevsky]]>

	    <![CDATA["That is what is wrong with cold people. Not that they have ice in their souls - we all have a bit of that - but that they insist every word and deed mirror that ice. They never learn the beauty or value of gesture. The emotional necessity. For them, it is all honesty before kindness, truth before art. Love is art, not truth. It's like painting scenery." -- Lorrie Moore]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["This suggests that our boding mechanisms depend on our own perception of the other and that therefore our ability to bond with them depends much more on emotional settings than on abstract &quot;humanlike&quot; qualities. For the same reason, it is the very emotionality Commmander Data from Star Trek displays every time it complains about having no emotions that endears it; an emotionless machine would not constantly raise the issues of its own worth, value, and personhood." -- Anne Foerst]]>
