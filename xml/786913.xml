	    <![CDATA["You could say that Elphaba brought us together,' said Boq softly.  'I'm closer to her and so I'm closer to you.'

Galinda seemed to give up.  She leaned her head back on the velvet cushions of the swing and said, 'Boq, you know despite myself I think you're a little sweet.  You're a little sweet and you're a little charming and you're a little maddening and you're a little habit-forming.'

Boq held his breath.

But you're little!' she concluded.  'You're a Munchkin, for god's sake!'

He kissed her, he kissed her, he kissed her, little by little by little." -- Gregory Maguire]]>

	    <![CDATA["Memory is a part of the present. It builds us up inside; it knits our bones to our muscles and keeps our hearts pumping. It is memory that reminds our bodies to work, and memory that reminds our spirits to work to: it keeps us who we are.~Candle" -- Gregory Maguire]]>
