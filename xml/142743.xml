	    <![CDATA["She put a hand on his hip and turned him to her. &quot;But things could go wrong, so i want to tell you something while it's just the two of us, Eddie.  I want to tell you how much I love you.&quot; She spoke simply, with no drama.
I know you do,&quot; he said, &quot;but I'll be damned if I know why.&quot;
Because you made me feel whole,&quot; she said.  &quot;When I was younger, I used to vacillate between thinking love was this great and glorious mystery and thinking it was just something a bunch of Hollywood move producers made up to sell more tickets in the Depression, when Dish Night kind of played out.&quot;
Eddie laughed.  
Now I think that all of us are born with a hole in our hearts, and we go around looking for the person who can fill it.  You...Eddie, you fill me up." -- Stephen King]]>
