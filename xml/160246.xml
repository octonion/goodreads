	    <![CDATA["The bridge will only take you halfway there, to those mysterious lands you long to see.  Through gypsy camps and swirling Arab fair, and moonlit woods where unicorns run free.  So come and walk awhile with me and share the twisting trails and wondrous worlds I've known.  But this bridge will only take you halfway there.  The last few steps you have to take alone." -- Shel Silverstein]]>

	    <![CDATA["You may glory in a team triumphant, but you fall in love with a team in defeat. Losing after great striving is the story of man, who was born to sorrow, whose sweetest songs tell of saddest thought, and who, if he is a hero, does nothing in life as becomingly as leaving it." -- Roger Kahn]]>

	    <![CDATA["I would love to believe that when I die I will live again, that some thinking, feeling, remembering part of me will continue. But as much as I want to believe that, and despite the ancient and worldwide cultural traditions that assert an afterlife, I know of nothing to suggest that it is more than wishful thinking." -- Carl Sagan]]>

	    <![CDATA["Strange is our situation here on Earth. Each of us comes for a short visit, not knowing why, yet sometimes seeming to divine a purpose. From the standpoint of daily life, however, there is one thing we do know: that man is here for the sake of other men - above all for those upon whose smiles and well-being our own happiness depends." -- Albert Einstein]]>

	    <![CDATA["West Wind #2

You are young. So you know everything. You leap
 into the boat and begin rowing. But listen to me.
 Without fanfare, without embarrassment, without
 any doubt, I talk directly to your soul. Listen to me.
 Lift the oars from the water, let your arms rest, and
 your heart, and heart’s little intelligence, and listen to
 me. There is life without love. It is not worth a bent
 penny, or a scuffed shoe. It is not worth the body of a
 dead dog nine days unburied. When you hear, a mile
 away and still out of sight, the churn of the water
 as it begins to swirl and roil, fretting around the
 sharp rocks – when you hear that unmistakable
 pounding – when you feel the mist on your mouth
 and sense ahead the embattlement, the long falls
 plunging and steaming – then row, row for your life
 toward it." -- Mary Oliver]]>
