	    <![CDATA["They [Americans] believe that the terrors of vast problems yield to the effects of many small solutions. 

Use little things to break big things, says Saint Paul, describing an essential feature of the psychology of hope." -- Roberto Mangabeira Unger]]>

	    <![CDATA["To understand your country you must love it.  To love it you must, in a sense, accept it.  To accept it as it is, however, is to betray it.  To accept your country without betraying it, you must love it for that in which it shows what it might become.  America - this monument to the genius of ordinary men and women, this place where hope becomes capacity, this long, halting turn of the no into the yes - needs citizens who love it enough to reimagine and remake it." -- Roberto Mangabeira Unger]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Seen from that future time, when every commodity the human mind could imagine would flow from the industrial horn of plenty in dizzy abundance, this would seem a scanty, shoddy, cramped moment indeed, choked with shadows, redeemed only by what it caused to be created.

Seen from plenty, now would be hard to imagine. It would seem not quite real, an absurd time when, for no apparent reason, human beings went without things easily within the power of humanity to supply and lives did not flower as it was obvious they could." -- Francis Spufford]]>
