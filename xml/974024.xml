		<description>
	    <![CDATA["For some of us, books are as important as almost anything else on earth.  What a miracle it is that out of these small, flat, rigid squares of paper unfolds world after world after world, worlds that sing to you, comfort and quiet or excite you.  Books help us understand who we are and how we are to behave.  They show us what community and friendship mean; they show us how to live and die." -- Anne Lamott]]>

	    <![CDATA["E.L. Doctorow said once said that 'Writing a novel is like driving a car at night. You can see only as far as your headlights, but you can make the whole trip that way.' You don't have to see where you're going, you don't have to see your destination or everything you will pass along the way. You just have to see two or three feet ahead of you. This is right up there with the best advice on writing, or life, I have ever heard." -- Anne Lamott]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["If something inside of you is real, we will probably find it interesting, and it will probably be universal. So you must risk placing real emotion at the center of your work. Write straight into the emotional center of things. Write toward vulnerability. Risk being unliked. Tell the truth as you understand it. If youâ€™re a writer you have a moral obligation to do this. And it is a revolutionary actâ€”truth is always subversive." -- Anne Lamott]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I think joy and sweetness and affection are a spiritual path. We're here to know God, to love and serve God, and to be blown away by the beauty and miracle of nature. You just have to get rid of so much baggage to be light enough to dance, to sing, to play. You don't have time to carry grudges; you don't have time to cling to the need to be right." -- Anne Lamott]]>

	    <![CDATA["Clutter and mess show us that life is being lived...Tidiness makes me think of held breath, of suspended animation... Perfectionism is a mean, frozen form of idealism, while messes are the artist's true friend. What people somehow forgot to mention when we were children was that we need to make messes in order to find out who we are and why we are here." -- Anne Lamott]]>

	    <![CDATA["No one has expressed it better than a great novelist I heard once on a talk show who said something like &quot;You want to know the price I pay for being a writer?  Okay, I'll tell you.  I travel by plane a great deal.  And I'm usually seated next to some huge businessman who works on files or his laptop computer for a while, and then notices me and asks me what I do.  And I say I'm a writer.  Then there's always a terrible silence.  Then he says eagerly, 'Have you written anything I might have heard of?" -- Anne Lamott]]>
