		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I brought to mind the image of the stranger lying there in the first light of dawn: the slight growth of whiskers on his chin, strands of his red hair shifting gently on the faint stirrings of the morning breeze, the pallor, the extended legs, the quivering fingers, that last, sucking breath.  And that word, blown into my face ... &lt;i&gt;&quot;Vale.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;

The thrill of it all!

Yes,&quot; I said, &quot;it was devastating." -- Alan Bradley]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["But then I'm distracted by movement in the Forest, a glimpse of red at the edge of my vision. She's no longer running, no longer even walking or standing, but crawling now. Dragging her broken body across the ground toward me, her fingers clawing at the dirt. Her progress is slow, unbearably so. Such that it's almost sad to see her reduced to this. Her body has used up it's stores of energy and has begun collapsing in on itself." -- Carrie Ryan (The Forest of Hands and Teeth)]]>

	    <![CDATA["A slow smile curved over my face, and I leaned down over him.  &quot;No,&quot; I said.  &quot;Wishes are lies.  Tell me you're going to leave.  Tell me you're not going to stay.  Tell me that it's only for a while so I can enjoy today,&quot; I whispered in his ear, as if saying it louder would break me.  &quot;And when you go, don't think me cold when I don't cry.  I can't cry anymore, Pierce.  It hurts too much." -- Kim Harrison]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["They're endless, stretching beyond the horizon and spreading around me like forever.  They heave and moan, frothing over each other, cresting and falling.  The pure depth and vastness of it all beyond comprehension, my eyes unable to focus on any individual.  Instead I'm drowned in their need.  They ripple and swell, the bodies of the Mudo, like the ocean.  Like the dead-tossed waves." -- Carrie Ryan]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["It's easy to look at people and make quick judgments about them, their present and their past, but you'd be amazed at the pain and tears a single smile hides. What a person shows to the world is only one tiny facet of the iceberg hidden from sight. And more often then not, it's lined with cracks and scars that go all the way to the foundation of their soul." -- Sherrilyn Kenyon]]>

	    <![CDATA["The alley and the music all fell away, and there was nothing but her and the rain and Jace, his hands on her. . . He made a noise of surprise, low in his throat, and dug his fingers into the thin fabric of her tights. Not unexpectedly, they ripped, and his wet fingers were suddenly on the bare skin of her legs. Not to be outdone, Clary slid her hands under the hem of his soaked shirt, and let her fingers explore what was underneath: the tight, hot skin over his ribs, the ridges of his abdomen, the scars on his back. This was uncharted territory for her, but it seemed to be driving him crazy: he was moaning softly against her mouth, kissing her harder and harder, as if it would never be enough, not quite enough —" -- Cassandra Clare]]>
