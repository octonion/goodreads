	    <![CDATA["I only hope that one day I can frighten my daughter this much. Right now, she's not scared of my husband or me at all. I think it's a problem. I was a freshman home from college the first time my dad said, &quot;You're going  out at ten p.m.? I don't think so,&quot; and I just laughed and said, &quot;It's fine.&quot; I feel like my daughter will be doing that to me by age six.

How can I give her what Don Fey gave me? The gift of anxiety. The fear of getting in trouble. The knowledge that while you are loved, you are not above the law. The Worldwide Parental Anxiety System is failing if this many of us have made sex tapes." -- Tina Fey]]>
