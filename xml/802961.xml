	    <![CDATA["Maybe one day you'll come back. Maybe you never will and that'll suck, but you can't keep doing this.  The blame and the self-loathing and the bullshit.  I can't watch that. It makes me hate you for hating yourself.  I don't want to lose you.  But I'd rather lose you if it means you'll be happy.  I think if you come back with me today, you'll never be okay.  And I'll never be okay if you aren't.  I need to know that there's a way for people like us to end up okay.  I need to know that there even is such a thing as okay, maybe even good, and it's out there and we just haven't found it yet.  There's got to be a happier ending than this, here.  There's got to be a better story.  Because we deserve one.  You deserve one.  Even if it doesn't end with you coming back to me." -- Katja Millay]]>
