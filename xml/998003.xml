	    <![CDATA["One of the things Ford Prefect had always found hardest to understand about human beings was their habit of continually stating and repeating the very very obvious, as in &lt;i&gt;It's a nice day,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;You're very tall,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Oh dear you seem to have fallen down a thirty-foot well, are you all right?&lt;/i&gt; At first Ford had formed a theory to account for this strange behaviour. If human beings don't keep exercising their lips, he thought, their mouths probably seize up. After a few months' consideration and observation he abandoned this theory in favour of a new one. If they don't keep on exercising their lips, he thought, their brains start working." -- Douglas Adams]]>
