	    <![CDATA["Is it time for your period, or something?&quot;

  With unerring instinct, he'd found a great big red button, and pushed it. Wyatt fights to win, which means he fights dirty. I understand the concept because that's how I fight, too, but understanding it didn't stop me from reacting. I could practically feel my blood bubbling with steam. &lt;i&gt;&quot;What?&quot;&lt;/i&gt;

  He turned around, all controlled aggression, and damned if he didn't push the button again. &quot;What is it about having a period that makes women so bitchy?&quot;

  ... It was an effort, but I said as sweetly as possible, &quot;It isn't that we're bitchier, it's that having a period makes us feel all tired and achy, so we have less tolerance for all the &lt;i&gt;bullshit&lt;/i&gt; we &lt;i&gt;normally SUFFER IN SILENCE.&lt;/i&gt;&quot; By the time the sentence ended the sweetness was long gone, my jaw was clenched, and I think my eyes were bugging out.

  Wyatt took a step back, belatedly looking alarmed." -- Linda Howard]]>

	    <![CDATA["Encouragement requires empathy and seeing the world from your spouse's perspective. We must first learn what is important to our spouse. Only then can we give encouragement. With verbal encouragement, we are trying to communicate, &quot;I know. I care. I am with you. How can I help?&quot; We are trying to show that we believe in him and in his abilities. We are giving credit and praise." -- Gary Chapman]]>

	    <![CDATA["What really knocks me out is a book that, when you're all done reading it, you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it. That doesn't happen much, though." -- J.D. Salinger]]>

&quot;Of course he does. Men love to be forgiven. It makes us feel better about our inability to learn from our mistakes." -- Lisa Kleypas]]>
