	    <![CDATA["Gilan hesitated. &quot;I wouldn't advise  anyone to face a battleax with just two knives,&quot; he said carefully.
So what should I do?&quot; Will joined in.  Gilan glared from one boy to the other.  He had the feeling he was being set up.
Shoot him,&quot; he said shortly.  Will shook his head, grinning.
Can't,&quot; he said. &quot;My bowstring's broken.&quot;
Then run and hide,&quot; said Gilan, between gritted teeth.
But there's a cliff,&quot; Horace pointed out. &quot;A sheer drop behind him and an angry axman coming at him.&quot;
What do I do?&quot; prompted Will.
Gilan took a deep breath and lookd them both in the eye, one after the other.
Jump off the cliff.  It'll be less messy that way." -- John Flanagan]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Passion. It lies in all of us. Sleeping... waiting... and though unwanted, unbidden, it will stir... open its jaws and howl. It speaks to us... guides us. Passion rules us all. And we obey. What other choice do we have? Passion is the source of our finest moments. The joy of love... the clarity of hatred... the ecstasy of grief. It hurts sometimes more than we can bear. If we could live without passion, maybe we'd know some kind of peace. But we would be hollow. Empty rooms, shuttered and dank. Without passion, we'd be truly dead." -- Joss Whedon]]>

So what's Digby got to complain about?&quot; Rodney asked.  It was obvious from his tone that he felt no sympathy for the recalcitrant commander of Barga Hold.
The Baron gestured for Lady Pauline to explain.
Apparently,&quot; she said,&quot;Halt threw him into the moat." -- John Flanagan]]>

	    <![CDATA["I wonder,&quot; she said. &quot;Does this castle have a moat?&quot;

A group of servants were busy emptying the privy buckets into the moat when they were startled by a sudden drawn-out cry.  They looked up in time see a scarlet-and-gold clad figure sail out of a first-story window, turn over once and then land with an enormus splash in the dark, rancid waters.  They shrugged and went back to work." -- John Flanagan]]>

The Ranger nodded.  &quot;More than I realized,&quot; he said.  Alyss urged her horse close beside his and learned over to kiss him on the cheek.
That's for Will when you see him.&quot; A ghost of a smile touched Halt's face.
You'll understand if I don't pass it on in person?&quot; he said.  Alyss smiled and leaned over and kissed  him again.
And that's for you, you jaded, bad-tempered old Ranger.&quot;
A little surprised by her own impulsivness, she urged her horse ahead of him.  Halt touched his cheek and looked at the slim blonde figure.
If I were twenty years younger...he began.
The he sighed and had to be honest with himself.  Make that thirty years, he thought." -- John Flanagan]]>
