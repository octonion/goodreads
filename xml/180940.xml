	    <![CDATA["While Catholics usually paint the Savior suffering, Mormon artists tend to depict Him as a rugged Idaho mountain man – the kind of Jesus you wouldn’t mind dating.

	    <![CDATA["I even tried to usher her into this century by explaining that wearing rainbows didn’t automatically mean a person was gay.  The Lucky Charms leprechaun was not necessarily a homosexual.  The Care Bear with the rainbow on his tummy did not have a life partner.  He didn’t even have genitals. (6)" -- Elna Baker]]>
