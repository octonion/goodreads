	    <![CDATA["I esteem myself happy to have as great an ally as [author:you|79396] in my search for truth. I will read [author:your|79396] work ... all the more willingly because I have for many years been a partisan of the [author:Copernican|3072638] view because it reveals to me the causes of many natural phenomena that are entirely incomprehensible in the light of the generally accepted hypothesis. To refute the latter I have collected many proofs, but I do not publish them, because I am deterred by the fate of our teacher [author:Copernicus|3072638] who, although he had won immortal fame with a few, was ridiculed and condemned by countless people (for very great is the number of the stupid).

{&lt;i&gt;Letter to fellow revolutionary astronomer [author:Johannes Kepelr|79396]&lt;/i&gt;}" -- Galileo Galilei]]>
