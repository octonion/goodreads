		<description>
	    <![CDATA["It is also important to notice that Satan enters the biblical scene as part of God’s creation. This means that he is not all powerful. He is only alive because God gives him life. He is a deadly deceiver, but his power is infinitely less than God’s power. So we shouldn’t be terrified of Satan’s power, but we do need to be wary of his lies and manipulation." -- Francis Chan]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The first sin was rebellion, idolatry, treason, and pride, all rolled into a single bite. Both Adam and Eve made a conscious choice to rebel against their Creator and live on their own terms. And we imitate their decision every time we choose our desires over God’s." -- Francis Chan]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Crawl underneath the hood of any growing church that is actually growing from the unchurched, and you will find that the number one reason newcomers attend is that they were invited by a friend. Churches grow from the unchurched because their members and attendees talk about it to their unchurched friends. It comes up in their conversations like the mention of a good movie, a favorite restaurant or a treasured vacation spot. There is a culture of invitation." -- Thom Rainer]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The churches delivering experiences that exceed guests' expectations are those to which people return, again and again, until they're no longer guests but full-fledged members of the church community. When a guest thinks &quot;Wow!&quot; it is because he or she feels affirmed and valued. The church has said, &quot;You matter.&quot;

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Our assignment is to make sure people can see Jesus clearly. This is the very reason we must meet them where they arc-consumer mentality and all. We must greet them with unconditional acceptance and respect. This is how people will begin to see Jesus clearly. Our goal should be to do anything and everything that helps our guests see Christ.

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The motivation to make a &quot;Wow!&quot; impression is not to better everyone else in town. It's not about stroking our egos, pleased with how excellent we are. &quot;Wow!&quot; impressions matter because people matter. What they think matters. What they believe matters. What they want matters. What they need matters.
First" -- Mark L. Waltz]]>
