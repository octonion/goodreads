	    <![CDATA["A genuine work of art must mean many things; the truer its art, the more things it will mean.  If my drawing, on the other hand, is so far from being a work of art that it needs THIS IS A HORSE written under it, what can it matter that neither you nor your child should know what it means?  It is there not so much to convey a meaning as to wake a meaning.  If it do not even wake an interest, throw it aside.  A meaning may be there, but it is not for you.  If, again, you do not know a horse when you see it, the name written under it will not serve you much.  At all events, the business of the painter is not to teach zoology." -- George MacDonald]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I am an absurd idealist.  But I believe that all that must come true.  For, unless it comes true, the world will be laid desolate.  And I believe that it can come true.  I believe that, by the grace of God, men will awake presently and be men again, and colour and laughter and splendid living will return to a grey civilisation.  But that will only come true because a few men will believe in it, and fight for it, and fight in its name against everything that sneers and snarls at that ideal." -- Leslie Charteris]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Conventionality is not morality.  Self-righteousness is not religion.  To attack the first is not to assail the last.  To pluck the mask from the face of the Pharisee, is not to lift an impious hand to the Crown of Thorns.

These things and deeds are diametrically opposed: they are as distinct as is vice from virtue.  Men too often confound them: they should not be confounded: appearance should not be mistaken for truth; narrow human doctrines, that only tend to elate and magnify a few, should not be substituted for the world-redeeming creed of Christ.  There is – I repeat it – a difference; and it is a good, and not a bad action to mark broadly and clearly the line of separation between them." -- Charlotte Brontë]]>

	    <![CDATA["Indeed taking all the evidence together, it is not too much to say that there is no single historic incident better or more variously supported than the Resurrection of Christ. Nothing but the antecedent assumption that it must be false could have suggested the idea of deficiency in the proof of it." -- Brooke Foss Westcott]]>
