		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The people cannot be all, and always, well informed. The part which is wrong will be discontented, in proportion to the importance of the facts they misconceive. If they remain quiet under such misconceptions, it is lethargy, the forerunner of death to the public liberty. ... What country before ever existed a century and half without a rebellion? And what country can preserve its liberties if their rulers are not warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance? Let them take arms. The remedy is to set them right as to facts, pardon and pacify them. What signify a few lives lost in a century or two? The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants. It is its natural manure." -- Thomas Jefferson]]>

There comes a time when one must take the position that is neither safe nor politic nor popular, but he must do it because conscience tells him it is right." -- Martin Luther King Jr.]]>

Will come when it will come." -- William Shakespeare]]>

[author:Diderot|11004], [author:D'Alembert|3295333], [author:D’Holbach|1228712], [author:Condorcet|6420223], are known to have been among the most virtuous of men. Their virtue, then, must have had some other foundation than the love of God.
