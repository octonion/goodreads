	    <![CDATA["It's because we're so trapped in our culture, in the being of being human on this planet with the brains we have, and the same two arms and legs everybody has. We're so trapped that any way we could imagine to escape would be just another part of the trap. Anything we want, we're trained to want." -- Chuck Palahniuk]]>

	    <![CDATA["It's just the problem with those things, and what i've learnt is this: they're meant to be a shortcut to the ultimate... thing, the plane, or whatever you want to say it like, yeah? It's meant to be: here's your thirty quid or whatever, take me to higher consciousness, please. And it don't work that way, bro. You don't get the full benefit. You've got to work your way up that tree, meaning that that is an allegory which is saying: you can't just fly up to the branches. You get me?" -- Zadie Smith]]>

	    <![CDATA["Emotions, in my experience, aren't covered by single words.
I don't believe in &quot;sadness&quot;, &quot;joy&quot;, or &quot;regret&quot;.
Maybe the best proof that the language is patriarchal is that is oversimplifies feeling. I'd like to have at my disposal complicated hybrid emotions." -- Jeffrey Eugenides]]>
