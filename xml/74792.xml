		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul. Lo-lee-ta: the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap, at three, on the teeth. Lo. Lee. Ta. She was Lo, plain Lo, in the morning, standing four feet ten in one sock. She was Lola in slacks. She was Dolly at school. She was Dolores on the dotted line. But in my arms she was always Lolita. Did she have a precursor? She did, indeed she did. In point of fact, there might have been no Lolita at all had I not loved, one summer, an initial girl-child. In a princedom by the sea. Oh when? About as many years before Lolita was born as my age was that summer. You can always count on a murderer for a fancy prose style. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, exhibit number one is what the seraphs, the misinformed, simple, noble-winged seraphs, envied. Look at this tangle of thorns." -- Vladimir Nabokov]]>

	    <![CDATA["It was, he thought, the difference between being dragged into the arena to face a battle to the death and walking into the arena with your head held high. Some people, perhaps, would say that there was little to choose between the two ways, but Dumbledore knew - and so do I, thought Harry, with a rush of fierce pride, and so did my parents - that there was all the difference in the world." -- J.K. Rowling]]>

	    <![CDATA["Well?&quot; Ron said finally, looking up at Harry. &quot;How was it?&quot;
Harry considered it for a moment. &quot;Wet,&quot; he said truthfully.
Ron made a noise that might have indicated jubilation or disgust, it was hard to tell.
&quot;Because she was crying,&quot; Harry continued heavily.
&quot;Oh,&quot; said Ron, his smile faded slightly. &quot;Are you that bad at kissing?&quot;
&quot;Dunno,&quot; said Harry, who hadn't considered this, and immediately felt rather worried. &quot;Maybe I am." -- J.K. Rowling]]>
