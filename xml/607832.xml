		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I have a friend who feels sometimes that the world is hostile to human life--he says it chills us and kills us.  But how could we be were it not for this planet that provided our very shape?  Two conditions--gravity and a livable temperature range between freezing and boiling--have given us fluids and flesh.  The trees we climb and the ground we walk on have given us five fingers and toes.  The &quot;place&quot; (from the root plat, broad, spreading, flat) gave us far-seeing eyes, the streams and breezes gave us versatile tongues and whorly ears.  The land gave us a stride, and the lake a dive.  The amazement gave us our kind of mind.  We should be thankful for that, and take nature's stricter lessons with some grace." -- Gary Snyder]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["At every moment you choose yourself.  But do you choose *your* self?  Body and soul contain a thousand possibilities out of which you can build many I's.  But in one of them is there a congruence of the elector and the elected.  Only one--which you will never find until you have excluded all those superficial and fleeting possibilities of being and doing with which you toy, out of curiosity or wonder or greed, and which hinder you from casting anchor in the experience of the mystery of life, and the consciousness of the talent entrusted to you which is your *I*." -- Dag Hammarskjöld]]>

	    <![CDATA["A heart pulsating in harmony with the circulation of sap and the flow of rivers?  A body with the rhythms of the earth in its movements?  No.  Instead: a mind, shut off from the oxygen of alert senses, that has wasted itself on 'treasons, stratagems and spoils'--of importance only within four walls.  A tame animal--in whom the strength of the species has outspent itself, to no purpose." -- Dag Hammarskjöld]]>

	    <![CDATA["Once to swim I sought the sea-side,
There to sport among the billows;
With the stone of many colors
Sank poor Aino to the bottom
Of the deep and boundless blue-sea,
Like a pretty son-bird, perished.
Never come a-fishing, father,
To the borders of these waters,
Never during all thy life-time,
As thou lovest daughter Aino.

Mother dear, I sought the sea-side,
There to sport among the billows;
With the stone of many colors,
Sank poor Aino to the bottom
Of the deep and boundless blue-sea,
Like a pretty song-bird perished.
Never mix thy bread, dear mother,
With the blue-sea's foam and waters,
Never during all thy life-time,
As thou lovest daughter Aino.
Brother dear, I sought the sea-side,
There to sport among the billows;
With the stone of many colors
Sank poor Aino to the bottom
Of the deep and boundless blue-sea,
Like a pretty song-bird perished.
Never bring thy prancing war-horse,
Never bring thy royal racer,
Never bring thy steeds to water,
To the borders of the blue-sea,
Never during all thy life-time,
As thou lovest sister Aino.

Sister dear, I sought the sea-side,
There to sport among the billows;
With the stone of many colors
Sank poor Aino to the bottom
Of the deep and boundless blue-sea,
Like a pretty song-bird perished.
Never come to lave thine eyelids
In this rolling wave and sea-foam,
Never during all thy life-time,
As thou lovest sister Aino.
All the waters in the blue-sea
Shall be blood of Aino's body;
All the fish that swim these waters
Shall be Aino's flesh forever;
All the willows on the sea-side
Shall be Aino's ribs hereafter;
All the sea-grass on the margin
Will have grown from Aino's tresses." -- Elias Lönnrot]]>

Soap and education are not as sudden as a massacre, but they are more deadly in the long run; because a half-massacred Indian may recover, but if you educate him and wash him, it is bound to finish him some time or other." -- Mark Twain]]>
