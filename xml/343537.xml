	    <![CDATA["Basic characteristics of an individual organism: to divide, to unite, to merge into the universal, to abide in the particular, to transform itself, to define itself, and as living things tend to appear under a thousand conditions, to arise and vanish, to solidify and melt, to freeze and flow, to expand and contract. Since these effects occur together, any or all may occur at the same moment." -- GOETHE JOHANN WOLFGANG VON]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["WIDE, the margin between carte blanche and the white page. Nevertheless it is not in the margin that you can find me, but in the yet whiter one that separates the word-strewn sheet from the transparent, the written page from the one to be written in the infinite space where the eye turns back to the eye, and the hand to the pen, where all we write is erased, even as you write it. For the book imperceptibly takes shape within the book we will never finish.

There is my desert." -- Edmond Jabès]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Most of my friends like words too well. They set them under the blinding light of the poem and try to extract every possible connotation from each of them, every temporary pun, every direct or indirect connection - as if a word could become an object by mere addition of consequences. Others pick up words from the streets, from their bars, from their offices and display them proudly in their poems as if they were shouting, &quot;See what I have collected from the American language. Look at my butterflies, my stamps, my old shoes!&quot; What does one do with all this crap?" -- Jack Spicer]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["It is very hard to live with silence.  The real silence is death and this is terrible.  To approach this silence, it is necessary to journey to the desert.  You do not go to the desert to find identity, but to loses it, to lose your personality, to be anonymous.  You make yourself void.  You &lt;I&gt;become&lt;/I&gt; silence.  You become more silent than the silence around you.  And then something extraordinary happens: you hear silence speak." -- Edmond Jabès]]>

	    <![CDATA["If there is a state where the soul can find a resting-place secure enough to establish itself and concentrate its entire being there, with no need to remember the past or reach into the future, where time is nothing to it, where the present runs on indefinitely but this duration goes unnoticed, with no sign of the passing of time, and no other feeling of deprivation or enjoyment, pleasure or pain, desire or fear than the simple feeling of  existence, a feeling that fills our soul entirely, as long as this state lasts, we can call ourselves happy, not with a poor, incomplete and relative happiness such as we find in the pleasures of life, but with a sufficient, complete and perfect happiness which leaves no emptiness to be filled in the soul." -- Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]>

Running alongside it and then forward is the deep blue Red Sea — with the edges of the land in very light turquoise blue rim, it is the rim. A very beautiful rim. The people are in the air. There are patches of sand in, as it goes in, the endless sea, the very light turquoise rimmed.  So it could be sky, which has white rainless clouds. In the sky or it could be in the sea.

Whatever is darker as shadows could be just in the air. Only in the air. Sand patches, rimmed or with the very light blue shallower sea.  But only if one's there." -- Leslie Scalapino]]>
