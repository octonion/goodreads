	    <![CDATA["I find the great thing in this world is not so much where we stand, as in what direction we are moving - we must sail sometimes with the wind and sometimes against it - but we must sail, and not drift, nor lie at anchor." -- Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr.]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Don't flatter yourself that friendship authorizes you to say disagreeable things to your intimates. The nearer you come into relation with a person, the more necessary do tact and courtesy become. Except in cases of necessity, which are rare, leave your friend to learn unpleasant things from his enemies; they are ready enough to tell them." -- Oliver Wendall Holmes]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["When men have realized that time has upset many fighting faiths, they may come to believe... that the ultimate good desired is better reached by free trade in ideas-- that the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market, and that truth is the only ground upon which their wishes safely can be carried out.  That at any rate is the theory of our Constitution.  It is an experiment.  As all life is an experiment.  Every year if not every day we wager our salvation upon some prophecy based upon imperfect knowledge.  " -- Oliver Wendell Holmes]]>
