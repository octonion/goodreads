	    <![CDATA["Once upon a time there was a bear and a bee who lived in a wood and were the best of friends. All summer long the bee collected nectar from morning to night while the bear lay on his back basking in the long grass. When winter came the bear realised he had nothing to eat and thought to himself 'I  hope that busy little bee will share some of his honey with me.' But the bee was nowhere to be found -  he had died of a stress induced coronary disease." -- Banksy]]>

	    <![CDATA["No wonder so many adults long to return to university, to all those deadlines - ahhh, that structure! Scaffolding to which we may cling! Even if it is arbitrary, without it, we're lost, wholly incapable of separating the Romantic from the Victorian in our sad, bewildering lives..." -- Marisha Pessl]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["In our twenties, when there is still so much time ahead of us, time that seems ample for a hundred indecisions, for a hundred visions and revisions—we draw a card, and we must decide right then and there whether to keep that card and discard the next, or discard the first card and keep the second. And before we know it, the deck has been played out and the decisions we have just made will shape our lives for decades to come." -- Amor Towles]]>
