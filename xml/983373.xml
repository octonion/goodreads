	    <![CDATA["It isn't Narnia, you know,&quot; sobbed Lucy. &quot;It's you. We shan't meet you there. And how can we live, never meeting you?&quot;
 &quot;But you shall meet me, dear one,&quot; said Aslan.
 &quot;Are -are you there too, Sir?&quot; said Edmund.
 &quot;I am,&quot; said Aslan. &quot;But there I have another name. You must learn to know me by that name. This was the very reason why you were brought to Narnia, that by knowing me here for a little, you may know me better there." -- C.S. Lewis]]>
