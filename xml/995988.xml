	    <![CDATA["Book of Mormon
4 Neiphi. 1: 4, 15-20

4  And it came to pass that the thirty and seventh year passed away also, and there still continued to be peace in the land. 
      •  •  •
  15   And it came to pass that there was no contention in the land, because of the love of God which did dwell in the hearts of the people. 
  16   And there were no envyings, nor strifes, nor tumults, nor horedoms, nor lyings, nor murders, nor any manner of lasciviousness; and surely there could not be a happier people among all the people who had been created by the hand of God. 
  17   There were no robbers, nor murderers, neither were there Lamanites, nor any manner of -ites; but they were in one, the children of Christ, and heirs to the kingdom of God. 
  18   And how blessed were they! For the Lord did bless them in all their doings; yea, even they were blessed and prospered until an *hundred and ten years had passed away; and the first generation from Christ had passed away, and there was no contention in all the land.
