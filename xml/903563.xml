		<description>
	    <![CDATA["In the things that really matter--our covenants, the commandments, and following the prophet--we need to be completely united.  In the non-essentials, we have our agency to handle things as we see fit.  But, in all things, regardless of whether we make the same choices or not, we are to treat each other with dignity and respect, both of which are evidences of charity in our hearts and lives." -- Sheri L.

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["It is not possible to sin enough to be happy. It isn't possible to buy enough to be happy, or to entertain or indulge or pamper ourselves enough to be happy. It is not possible to hide enough or run far enough away from trials and troubles to be happy. Happiness and joy come only when we are living up to who we are...

I have never met anyone who was happier because he was immoral, or because he was addicted to something, or because he was dishonest and compromised his integrity. " -- Sheri L. Dew]]>
