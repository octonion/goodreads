	    <![CDATA["If you were to say to the grown-ups: &quot;I saw a beautiful house made of rosy brick, with geraniums in the windows and doves on the roof,&quot; they would not be able to get any idea of that house at all. You would have to say to them, &quot;I saw a house that cost $20,000.&quot; Then they would exclaim, &quot;Oh, what a pretty house that is!" -- Antoine de Saint Exupéry]]>

	    <![CDATA["There's never been a true war that wasn't fought between two sets of people who were certain they were in the right. The really dangerous people believe they are doing whatever they are doing solely and only because it is without question the right thing to do. And that is what makes them dangerous." -- Neil Gaiman]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["This sentence has five words. Here are five more words. Five-word sentences are fine. But several together become monotonous. Listen to what is happening. The writing is getting boring. The sound of it drones. It’s like a stuck record. The ear demands some variety. Now listen. I vary the sentence length, and I create music. Music. The writing sings. It has a pleasant rhythm, a lilt, a harmony. I use short sentences. And I use sentences of medium length. And sometimes, when I am certain the reader is rested, I will engage him with a sentence of considerable length, a sentence that burns with energy and builds with all the impetus of a crescendo, the roll of the drums, the crash of the cymbals–sounds that say listen to this, it is important." -- Gary Provost]]>
