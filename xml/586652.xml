	    <![CDATA["Each relationship between two persons is absolutely unique.  That is why you cannot love two people the same.  It simply is not possible.  You love each person differently because of who they are and the uniqueness that they draw out of you." -- William P. Young]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["You build your world around someone, and then what happens when he disappears?  Where do you go- into pieces, into atoms, into the arms of another man?  You go shopping, you cook dinner, you work odd hours, you make love to someone else on June nights.  But you're not really there, you're someplace else where there is blue sky and a road you don't recognize.  If you squint your eyes, you think you see him, in the shadows, beyond the trees.  You always imagine that you see him, but he's never there.  It's only his spirit, that's what's there beneath the bed when you kiss your husband, there when you send your daughter off to school.  It's in your coffee cup, your bathwater, your tears.  Unfinished business always comes back to haunt you, and a man who swears he'll love you forever isn't finished with you until he's done." -- Alice Hoffman]]>
