	    <![CDATA["I will find you,&quot; he whispered in my ear.  &quot;I promise.  If I must endure two hundred years of purgatory, two hundred years without you - then that is my punishment, which I have earned for my crimes.  For I have lied, and killed, and stolen; betrayed and broken trust.  But there is the one thing that shall lie in the balance.  When I shall stand before God, I shall have one thing to say, to weigh against the rest.&quot;

His voice dropped, nearly to a whisper, and his arms tightened around me.

Lord, ye gave me a rare woman, and God!  I loved her well." -- Diana Gabaldon]]>

	    <![CDATA["I prayed all the way up that hill yesterday, he said softly. Not for you to stay; I didna think that would be right. I prayed I'd be strong enough to send ye away. He shook his head, still gazing up the hill, a faraway look in his eyes. 
I said 'Lord, if I've never had courage in my life before, let me have it now. Let me be brave enough not to fall on my knees and beg her to stay.' He pulled his eyes away from the cottage and smiled briefly at me. 
Hardest thing I ever did, Sassenach." -- Diana Gabaldon]]>

In return for which ye call me names, insult my manhood, kick me in the ballocks and claw my face. Then I beat you half to death and tell ye all the most humiliating things have ever happened to me, and ye say ye love me.&quot; He laid his head on his knees and laughed some more. Finally he rose and held out a hand to me, wiping his eyes with the other. 
       &quot;You're no verra sensible, Sassenach, but I like ye fine. Let's go." -- Diana Gabaldon]]>
