	    <![CDATA["Read, read, read. Read everything -- trash, classics, good and bad, and see how they do it. Just like a carpenter who works as an apprentice and studies the master. Read! You'll absorb it.
Then write. If it's good, you'll find out. If it's not, throw it out of the window." -- William Faulkner]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I decline to accept the end of man... I refuse to accept this.  I believe that man will not merely endure: he will prevail.  He is immortal, not because he alone among the creatures has an inexhaustible voice, but because he has a soul, a spirit capable of compassion and sacrifice and endurance.  The poet's, the writer's, duty is to write about these things.  It is his privilege to help man endure by lifting his heart, by reminding him of the courage and honor and hope and pride and compassion and pity and sacrifice which have been the glory of his past.  The poet's voice need not merely be the record of man, it can be one of the props, the pillars to help him endure and prevail." -- William Faulkner]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The sense of unhappiness is so much easier to convey than that of happiness. In misery we seem aware of our own existence, even though it may be in the form of a monstrous egotism: this pain of mine is individual, this nerve that winces belongs to me and to no other. But happiness annihilates  us: we lose our identity." -- Graham Greene]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I don't care a damn about men who are loyal to the people who pay them, to organizations...I don't think even my country means all that much.  There are many countries in our blood, aren't there, but only one person.  Would the world be in the mess it is if we were loyal to love and not to countries?" -- Graham Greene]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Time has its revenges, but revenge seems so often sour.  Wouldn’t we all do better not trying to understand, accepting the fact that no human being will ever understand another, not a wife with a husband, nor a parent a child?  Perhaps that’s why men have invented God – a being capable of understanding. " -- Graham Greene]]>

	    <![CDATA["The power of the dead is that we think they see us all the time.  The dead have a presence. Is there a level of energy composed solely of the dead?  They are also in the ground, of course, asleep and crumbling.  Perhaps we are what they dream." -- Don DeLillo]]>
