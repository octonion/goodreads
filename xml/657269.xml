	    <![CDATA["The moment I laid eyes on you, I knew you were trouble.&quot;
&quot;Ditto.&quot;
&quot;I wanted to drag you between the shelves, fuck you senseless, and send you home.&quot;
&quot;If you'd done that, I never would have left.&quot;
&quot;You're still here anyway.&quot;
&quot;You don't have to sound so sour about it.&quot;
&quot;You're upsetting my entire existence.&quot;
&quot;Fine, I'll leave.&quot;
&quot;Try and I'll chain you up." -- Karen Marie Moning]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["One day you do meet a man who kisses you and you can’t breathe around it and you realize you don’t need air.  Oxygen is trivial.  Desire makes life happen.  Makes it matter.  Makes everything worth it.  Desire is life.  Hunger to see the next sunrise or sunset.  To touch the one you love.  To try again." -- Karen Marie Moning]]>

	    <![CDATA["I didn’t ask. Some things are better left unsaid.
He looked at me and I shivered. I never get enough of him. 
Never will.
He lives.
I breathe.
I want. Him. Always.
Fire to my ice. Ice to my fever.
Later we would go to bed, and when he rose over me, dark and vast and eternal, I’d know joy." -- Karen Marie Moning]]>

	    <![CDATA["I don't have any idea what to wear anymore, so I tried to cover all bases.&quot;
&quot;Try skin.&quot;
&quot;Little chilly for that.&quot;
We looked at each other across the coffee table.
His eyes didn't say, &lt;i&gt;I'd heat you up,&lt;/i&gt; and mine didn't say &lt;i&gt;What are you waiting for?&lt;/i&gt; He didn't reply, &lt;i&gt;Fuck if I'm making the first move,&lt;/i&gt; so I was careful not to say, &lt;i&gt;I wish you would, because I can't, because I'm...&lt;/i&gt; and he didn't snap &lt;i&gt;...choking on your pride?!&lt;/i&gt;
&quot;As if you aren't.&quot;
&quot;Excuse me?&quot;
&quot;Really Barrons,&quot; I said drily. &quot;I'm not the only one who didn't just not have that conversation, and you know it.&quot;
There was the faint, sexy lift of his lip. &quot;You're a piece of work, Ms. Lane.&quot;
&quot;Right back at you." -- Karen Marie Moning]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Ancient eyes had stared at me, filled with ancient grief. And something more. Something so alien and unexpected that I'd almost burst into tears. I'd seen many things in his eyes in the time that I'd known him: lust, amusement, sympathy, mockery, caution, fury. But I had never seen this. 

Hope. Jericho Barrons had hope, and I was the reason for it. 

I would never forget his smile. It had illuminated him from the inside out." -- Karen Marie Moning]]>

Rainbow Girl. Was that who I was?
