		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Any father…must finally give his child up to the wilderness and trust to the providence of God.  It seems almost a cruelty for one generation to beget another when parents can secure so little for their children, so little safety, even in the best circumstances.  Great faith is required to give the child up, trusting God to honor the parents’ love for him by assuring that there will indeed be angels in that wilderness." -- Marilynne Robinson]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["…at the root of real honor is always the sense of the sacredness of the person who is its object…When you love someone to the degree you love her, you see her as God sees her, and that is an instruction in the nature of God and humankind and of Being itself." -- Marilynn Robinson]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Sinners are not all dishonorable people, not by any means.  But those who are dishonorable never really repent and never really reform.  Now, I may be wrong here.  No such distinction occurs in Scripture.  And repentance and reformation are matters of the soul which only the Lord can judge.  But, in my experience, dishonor is recalcitrant.  When I see it, my heart sinks, because I feel I have no help to offer a dishonorable person…" -- Marilynn Robinson]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Oh, what strange wonderful clocks women are. They nest in Time. They make the flesh that holds fast and binds eternity. They live inside the gift, know power, accept, and need not mention it. Why speak of time when you are Time, and shape the universal moments, as they pass, into warmth and action?" -- Ray Bradbury]]>
