		<description>
	    <![CDATA["If in the past people would listen to music out of love for music, nowadays it roars everywhere and all the time, &quot;regardless whether we want to hear it&quot;, it roars from loudspeakers, in cars, in restaurants, in elevators, in the streets, in waiting rooms, in gyms, in the earpieces of Walkmans, music rewritten, reorchestrated, abridged, and stretched out, fragments of rock, of jazz, of opera, a flood of everything jumbled together so that we don't know who composed it (music become noise is anonymous), so that we can't tell beginning from end (music become noise has no form): sewage-water music in which music is dying." -- Milan Kundera]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["To die; to decide to die; that's much easier for an adolescent than for an adult. What? Doesn't death strip an adolescent of a far larger portion of future?
