	    <![CDATA["Every fairy tale, it seems, concludes with the bland phrase &quot;happily ever after.&quot; Yet every couple I have ever known would agree that nothing about marriage is forever happy. There are moments of bliss, to be sure, and lengthy spans of satisfied companionship. Yet these come at no small effort, and the girl who reads such fiction dreaming her troubles will end ere she departs the altar is well advised to seek at once a rational women to set her straight." -- Catherine Gilbert Murdock]]>
