	    <![CDATA["I promise I'll never tell.&quot;

&quot;Don't promise that,&quot; he said in an ultraserious voice. &quot;If they try to hurt you and the only way to protect yourself is to tell them what you know about me, then you tell them. Straight off, okay?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot; 

&quot;Promise me.&quot;

&quot;No!&quot;

&quot;I will possess your heart.&quot;

Heat flared along the back of my neck. &quot;What did you say?&quot;

&quot;My favorite song. 'I Will Possess Your Heart.'&quot;

&quot;By Death Cab for Cutie?&quot;

He snorted. &quot;No, the little known T.I. Hip-hop remix. Yes, Death Cab for Cutie.&quot;

... &quot;Why? What's wrong with it?&quot;

&quot;Nothing, but it doesn't seem to fit you. It's kind of a sad song.&quot; 

&quot;No it's pure confident. It's not 'I want' or 'I need', none of that crap.&quot; He slipped his hand over mine. &quot;It's 'I will.'&quot;

A nervous laugh bubbled up. &quot;You will, huh?&quot;

His fingers brushed my cheek, then slid into my hair. &quot;I will." -- Jeri Smith-Ready]]>

Straightening up, Zachary rubbed the back of his neck and smirked. &quot;I might, I might.&quot;

I was talking to Liz and she said maybe coming back to your old life would be too painful, that maybe it'd be easier for you to erase us. And that would suck, but I'd do it. I can lose you like that if I don't lose you today. I'll let you go. If you stay." -- Gayle Forman]]>

	    <![CDATA["I walked in without knocking. The screen door banged to a close behind me announcing my presence. I followed my nose to the kitchen and found Kaleb standing by the stove. He stirred something that smelled absolutely delicious a wooden spoon in one hand and a huge chef’s knife in the other.

“Are you sober ” I asked from the doorway.
 
He turned and leveled a smile at me that made me a little wobbly. “I am.&quot;
 
“Good. Because if not I was going to take the deadly kitchen utensil away from you.” I crossed the room and pulled myself up to sit on the counter beside the stove. A cutting board full of green peppers and two uncut stalks of celery waited for attention from the knife. Melted butter and diced onions bubbled in a sauté pan on the stove. “You cook&quot;
 
Kaleb was so pretty I was jealous. Pretty with ripped muscles and a tattoo of a red dragon covering most of his upper body. “Yes ” he said. “I cook.”
 
“Do you usually wear a wife beater and ” I pushed him back a little by his shoulder “an apron that says ‘Kiss the Cook’ while you’re doing it ”
 
He leaned so close to me my heart skipped a couple of beats. “I’ll wear it all the time if you’ll consider it." -- Myra McEntire]]>
