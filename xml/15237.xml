	    <![CDATA["After the small woman had left, Ushikawa stared at the door for the longest time. She had shut the door behind her, but there was still a strong sense of her in the room.

And what could it possibly mean?" -- Haruki Murakami]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Every moral precept is an delusion. Even the stars are a mirage. The truth is darkness, and the only thing that matters is making a statement before one enters it. Cutting the skin of the world and leaving a scar. That's all history is, after all: scar tissue." -- Steven King]]>
