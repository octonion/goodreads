	    <![CDATA["Just because you're naked 
doesn't mean you're sexy, 
Just because you're cynical 
Doesn't mean you're cool.  
You may tell the greatest lies 
And wear a brilliant digsuise 
But you can't escape the eyes 
of the one who sees right through you.  In the end what will prevail 
Is your passion not your tale.  
For love is the Holy Grail, 
Even in Cognito.  
So better listen to me, sister, 
and pay close attention, mister: 
It's very good to play the game, 
Amuse the gods, avoid the pain, 
But don't trust fortune, don't trust fame, 
Your real self doesn't know your name And in that we're all the same: 
We're all incognito." -- Tom Robbins]]>

	    <![CDATA["It doesn't matter how sensitive you are or how damn smart and educated you are, if you're not both at the same time, if your heart and your brain aren't connected, aren't working together harmoniously, well, you're just hopping through life on one leg. You may think you're walking, you may think you're running a damn marathon, but you're only on a hop trip. The connections gotta be maintained." -- Tom Robbins]]>
