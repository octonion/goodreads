		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I have a history of making decisions very quickly about men.  I have always fallen in love fast and without measuring risks.  I have a tendency not only to see the best in everyone, but to assume that everyone is emotionally capable of reaching his highest potential.  I have fallen in love more times than I care to count with the highest potential of a man, rather than with the man himself, and I have hung on to the relationship for a long time (sometimes far too long) waiting for the man to ascend to his own greatness.  Many times in romance I have been a victim of my own optimism." -- Elizabeth Gilbert]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I agree with yours of the 22d that &lt;b&gt;a professorship of Theology should have no place in our institution&lt;/b&gt;. but we cannot always do what is absolutely best. those with whom we act, entertaining different views, have the power and the right of carrying them into practice. truth advances, &amp; error recedes step by step only; and to do to our fellow-men the most good in our power, we must lead where we can, follow where we cannot, and still go with them, watching always the favorable moment for helping them to another step.

[&lt;i&gt;Comment on establishing Jefferson's University of Virginia, a secular college, in a letter to Thomas Cooper 7 October 1814&lt;/i&gt;]" -- Thomas Jefferson]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["and when love came to us twice 
and lied to us twice 
we decided to never love again 
that was fair 
fair to us 
and fair to love itself. 

we ask for no mercy or no 
miracles; 
we are strong enough to live 
and to die and to 
kill flies, 

attend the boxing matches, go to the racetrack, 
live on luck and skill, 
get alone, get alone often, 
and if you can't sleep alone 
be careful of the words you speak in your sleep; 
and 
ask for no mercy 
no miracles; 

and don't forget: 
time is meant to be wasted, 
love fails
and death is useless." -- Charles Bukowski]]>

the light in the window 
your records 
your books 
our morning coffee 
our noons our nights 
our bodies spilled together 
sleeping 
the tiny flowing currents 
immediate and forever 
your leg my leg 
your arm my arm 
your smile and the warmth 
of you 
who made me laugh 
again." -- Charles Bukowski]]>
