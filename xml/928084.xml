		<description>
	    <![CDATA["For years now I've kind of operated under an informal shopping cycle. A bit like a farmer's crop rotation system. Except, instead of wheat, maize, barley, and fallow, mine pretty much goes clothes, makeup shoes, and clothes (I don't bother with fallow). Shopping is actually very similar to farming a field. You can't keep buying the same thing, you have to have a bit of variety. Otherwise you get bored and stop enjoying yourself." -- Sophie Kinsella]]>

	    <![CDATA["Jennifer Aniston and Her New Man'&quot; I read the words aloud uncertainly. &quot;What new man? Why would she need a new man?&quot;

&quot;Oh yes.&quot; Nicole follows my gaze, unconcerned. &quot;You know she split up from Brad Pitt?&quot;

&quot;Jennifer and Brad split?&quot; I stare up at her, aghast. &quot;You can't be serious! They can't have done!&quot;

&quot;He went off with Angelina Jolie. They've got a daughter.&quot;

&quot;No!&quot; I wail. &quot;But Jen and Brad were so perfect together! They looked so good and they had that lovely wedding picture and everything....&quot;

&quot;They're divorced now.&quot; Nicole shrugs, like it's no big deal.

I can't get over this. Jennifer and Brad divorced. The world is a different place." -- Sophie Kinsella]]>

	    <![CDATA["Remember, if the time should come when you have to make a choice between what is right and what is easy, remember what happened to a boy who was good, and kind, and brave, because he strayed across the path of Lord Voldemort.  Remember Cedric Diggory." -- J.K. Rowling]]>

	    <![CDATA["You'd think people had better things to gossip about,&quot; said Ginny as she sat on the common room floor, leaning against Harry’s legs and reading the Daily Prophet. &quot;Three Dementor attacks in a week, and all Romilda Vane does is ask me if it’s true you’ve got a Hippogriff tattooed across your chest.&quot;
Ron and Hermione both roared with laughter. Harry ignored them.
What did you tell her?&quot;
I told her it's a Hungarian Horntail,&quot; said Ginny, turning a page of the newspaper idly. &quot;Much more macho.&quot;
Thanks,&quot; said Harry, grinning. &quot;And what did you tell her Ron’s got?&quot;
A Pygmy Puff, but I didn’t say where." -- J.K. Rowling]]>

	    <![CDATA["How do you feel, Georgie?&quot; whispered Mrs. Weasley.
George's fingers groped for the side of his head.
&quot;Saintlike,&quot; he murmured.
&quot;What's wrong with him?&quot; croaked Fred, looking terrified. &quot;Is his mind affected?&quot;
&quot;Saintlike,&quot; repeated George, opening his eyes and looking up at his brother. &quot;You see...I'm HOLEY, Fred, geddit?" -- J.K. Rowling]]>
