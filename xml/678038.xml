	    <![CDATA["I visited a certain king
who had a certain fool
the king was gray with wisdom got
from forty years of school

the fool was pink with nonsense
and could barely write his name
but he new a lot of little songs
and sang them just the same

the fool was gay; the king was not
now tell me if you can
which was perhaps the greater fool
and which the wiser man?" -- natalie babbit?]]>

	    <![CDATA["From that time on, the world was hers for the reading. She would never be lonely again, never miss the lack of intimate friends. Books became her friends and there was one for every mood. There was poetry for quiet companionship. There was adventure when she tired of quiet hours. There would be love stories when she came into adolescence and when she wanted to feel a closeness to someone she could read a biography. On that day when she first knew she could read, she made a vow to read one book a day as long as she lived." -- Betty Smith]]>
