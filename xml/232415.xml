	    <![CDATA["I invent stories, confront one with another, and by this means I ask questions.  The stupidity of people comes from having an answer to everything.  The wisdom of the novel comes from having a question for everything." -- Milan Kundera]]>

	    <![CDATA["One glance at (a book) and you hear the voice of another person - perhaps someone dead for thousands of years.  Across the millenia, the author is speaking, clearly and silently, inside your head, directly to you.  Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions, binding together people, citizens of distant epochs, who never knew one another.  Books break the shackles of time." -- Carl Sagan]]>
