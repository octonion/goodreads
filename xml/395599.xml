		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Sometimes, looking at the many books I have at home, I feel I shall die before I come to the end of them, yet I cannot resist the temptation of buying new books. Whenever I walk into a bookstore and find a book on one of my hobbies — for example, Old English or Old Norse poetry — I say to myself, “What a pity I can’t buy that book, for I already have a copy at home." -- Jorge Luis Borges]]>

	    <![CDATA["A book is a physical object in a world of physical objects. It is a set of dead symbols.
