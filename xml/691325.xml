	    <![CDATA["Behind me, I heard a young woman of 25 say, &quot;If it weren’t for my horse, I wouldn’t have spent that year in college.&quot; Now, I'm gonna repeat that, because it bears repeating. &quot;If it weren't for my horse...&quot; as in, giddyup, giddyup, let's go — &quot;I wouldn't have spent that year in college,&quot; which is a degree-granting institution. Don't think about that too long, or BLOOD will shoot out your NOSE!" -- Lewis Black]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["[Referring to passage by Alice Munro] Finally, the passage contradicts a form of bad advice often given young writers -- namely, that the job of the author is to show, not tell. Needless to say, many great novelists combine &quot;dramatic&quot; showing with long sections of the flat-out authorial narration that is, I guess, what is meant by telling. And the warning against telling leads to a confusion that causes novice writers to think that everything should be acted out -- don't tell us a character is happy, show us how she screams &quot;yay&quot; and jumps up and down for joy -- when in fact the responsibility of showing should be assumed by the energetic and specific use of language." -- Francine Prose]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["With so much reading ahead of you, the temptation might be to speed up. But in fact it’s essential to slow down and read every word. Because one important thing that can be learned by reading slowly is the seemingly obvious but oddly underappreciated fact that language is the medium we use in much the same way a composer uses notes, the way a painter uses paint. I realize it may seem obvious, but it’s surprising how easily we lose sight of the fact that words are the raw material out of which literature is crafted." -- Francine Prose]]>
