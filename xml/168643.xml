		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I wish to Heaven I was married,&quot; she said resentfully as she attacked the yams with loathing. &quot;I'm tired of everlastingly being unnatural and never doing anything I want to do. I'm tired of acting like I don't eat more than a bird, and walking when I want to run and saying I feel faint after a waltz, when I could dance for two days and never get tired. I'm tired of saying, 'How wonderful you are!' to fool men who haven't got one-half the sense I've got, and I'm tired of pretending I don't know anything, so men can tell me things and feel important while they're doing it... I can't eat another bite." -- Margaret Mitchell]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["THAT crazed girl improvising her music.
Her poetry, dancing upon the shore,

Her soul in division from itself
Climbing, falling She knew not where,
Hiding amid the cargo of a steamship,
Her knee-cap broken, that girl I declare
A beautiful lofty thing, or a thing
Heroically lost, heroically found.

No matter what disaster occurred
She stood in desperate music wound,
Wound, wound, and she made in her triumph
Where the bales and the baskets lay
No common intelligible sound
But sang, 'O sea-starved, hungry sea" -- William Butler Yeats]]>

	    <![CDATA["Since he knew things at the beginning, maybe at the end he knew things too.  That we had gone as far as chance would take us.  That nothing is more sacred than youth or more hopeful than turning yourself over to someone and saying ~ I have this time, it is not a long time, but it is my best time and my best gift, and I give it to you.  When I revisit my youth, I re-visit you." -- Hilary Thayer Hamann]]>
