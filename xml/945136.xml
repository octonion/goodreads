	    <![CDATA["If there is no struggle, there is no progress. Those who profess to favor freedom, and yet depreciate agitation, are men who want crops without plowing up the ground. They want rain without thunder and lightning. They want the ocean without the awful roar of its many waters. This struggle may be a moral one; or it may be a physical one; or it may be both moral and physical; but it must be a struggle." -- Frederick Douglass]]>

	    <![CDATA["Experience, as we know, is deceptive: one judges the world through the prism of what has happened to oneself and considers this a just and reasonable approach, when in fact it is quite obviously the perfect tactic for never learning anything about anything." -- Juan Bonilla]]>
