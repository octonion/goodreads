	    <![CDATA["A wager?&quot; I repeated.
&quot;Yes,&quot; he said, and gave me a slow smile, bright with challenge. ...
&quot;Stake?&quot; I asked cautiously. He was still smiling, an odd sort of smile, hard to define.
&quot;A kiss.&quot; My first reaction was outrage, but then I remembered that I was on my way to Court, and that had to be the kind of thing they did at Court. And if I win I don't have to collect. I hesitated only a moment longer, lured by the thought of open sky, and speed, and winning.
&quot;Done,&quot; I said." -- Sherwood Smith, ]]>

	    <![CDATA["Well,” said the frog, “what are you going to do about it?”

“Marrying Therandil? I don’t know. I’ve tried talking to my parents, but they won’t listen, and neither will Therandil.”

“I didn’t ask what you’d said about it,” the frog snapped. “I asked what you’re going to do. Nine times out of ten, talking is a way of avoiding doing things." -- Patricia C. Wrede]]>
