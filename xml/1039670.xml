	    <![CDATA["I don't want to analyze myself or anything, but I think, in fact I know this to be true, that I enter the world through what I write. 
I grew up believing, and continue to believe, that I am a screw-up, that growing up with my family and friends, I had nothing to offer in any conversation. 
But when I started writing, suddenly there was something that I brought to the party that was at a high-enough level." -- Aaron Sorkin]]>
