	    <![CDATA["I remember it all: every word, every breath, every tick of the clock . . . everything that happened is with me forever.
I can never forget it.
But that dosen't mean I can live it again. You can't live what's gone, you can only remember it, and memories have no life. They're just pale reminders of a time that's gone - like faded photographs, or a dried-up daisy chain at the back of a drawer. They have no substance. They can't take you back. Nothing can take you back.
Nothing can be the same as it was.
Nothing is.

All I can do is tell it." -- Kevin M. Brooks]]>
