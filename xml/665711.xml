		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I wrote to find beauty and purpose, to know that love is possible and lasting and real, to see day lilies and swimming pools, loyalty and devotion, even though my eyes were closed, and all that surrounded me was a darkened room.  I wrote because that was who I was at the core, and if I was too damaged to walk around the block, I was lucky all the same.  Once I got to my desk, once I started writing, I still believed anything was possible." -- Alice Hoffman]]>

	    <![CDATA["Feel lucky for what you have when you have it. Isn't that the point? Happily ever after doesn't mean happy forever. The ever after, what precisely was that? Your dreams, your life, your death, your everything. Was it the blank space that went on without us? The forever after we were gone? " -- Alice Hoffman]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["You build your world around someone, and then what happens when he disappears?  Where do you go- into pieces, into atoms, into the arms of another man?  You go shopping, you cook dinner, you work odd hours, you make love to someone else on June nights.  But you're not really there, you're someplace else where there is blue sky and a road you don't recognize.  If you squint your eyes, you think you see him, in the shadows, beyond the trees.  You always imagine that you see him, but he's never there.  It's only his spirit, that's what's there beneath the bed when you kiss your husband, there when you send your daughter off to school.  It's in your coffee cup, your bathwater, your tears.  Unfinished business always comes back to haunt you, and a man who swears he'll love you forever isn't finished with you until he's done." -- Alice Hoffman]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["If every life is a river, then it's little wonder that we do not even notice the changes that occur until we are far out in the darkest sea.  One day you look around and nothing is familiar, not even your own face.
     My name once meant daughter, grandaughter, friend, sister, beloved. Now those words mean only what their letters spell out; Star in the night sky. Truth in the darkness.
I have crossed over to a place where I never thought I'd be.  I am someone I would have never imagined.   A secret. A dream.  I am this, body and soul. Burn me. Drown me. Tell me lies.  I will still be who I am." -- Alice Hoffman]]>
