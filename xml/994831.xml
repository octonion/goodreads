	    <![CDATA["A good working definition of fanaticism is that you are so convinced of your views and policies that you are sure that anyone who opposed them must be either stupid and decieved or have some ulterior motive.  We are today a nation where almost everyone in the public eye displays fanaticism with every utterance." -- Orson Scott Card]]>

	    <![CDATA["The paradox of vengefulness is that it makes men dependent upon those who have harmed them, believing that their release from pain will come only when they make their tormentors suffer. In seeking the Bird's death to free himself, Louie had chained himself, once again, to his tyrant. During the war, the Bird had been unwilling to let go of Louie; after the war, Louie was unable to let go of the Bird." -- Laura Hilenbrand]]>
