	    <![CDATA["Elmore Leonard's Ten Rules of Writing

1. Never open a book with weather.
2.  Avoid prologues.
3. Never use a verb other than &quot;said&quot; to carry dialogue.
4. Never use an adverb to modify the verb &quot;said”…he admonished gravely.
5. Keep your exclamation points under control. You are allowed no more than two or three per 100,000 words of prose. 
6. Never use the words &quot;suddenly&quot; or &quot;all hell broke loose.&quot;
7. Use regional dialect, patois, sparingly.
8. Avoid detailed descriptions of characters.
9. Don't go into great detail describing places and things.
10. Try to leave out the part that readers tend to skip.

My most important rule is one that sums up the 10.

If it sounds like writing, I rewrite it." -- Elmore Leonard]]>

	    <![CDATA["I believe that, through the act of living, the discovery of oneself is made concurrently with the discovery of the world around us, which can mold us, but which can also be affected by us. A balance must be established between these two worlds—the one inside us and the one outside us." -- Henri Cartier-Bresson]]>
