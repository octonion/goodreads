	    <![CDATA["Love entered in my heart one day
A sad, unwelcome guest.
But when it begged that it might stay
I let it stay and rest

It broke my nights with sorrowing
It filled my heart with fears
And, when my soul was prone to sing,
It filled my eyes with tears.

But...now that it has gone its way,
I miss the dear ole pain.
And, sometimes, in the night I pray
That Love might come again." -- J. California Cooper]]>

	    <![CDATA["When someone you love dies, and you're not expecting it, you don't lose her all at once; you lose her in pieces over a long time—the way the mail stops coming, and her scent fades from the pillows and even from the clothes in her closet and drawers. Gradually, you accumulate the parts of her that are gone. Just when the day comes—when there's a particular missing part that overwhelms you with the feeling that she's gone, forever—there comes another day, and another specifically missing part." -- John Irving]]>

	    <![CDATA["First they came for the communists, and I did not speak out—
    because I was not a communist;
Then they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out—
    because I was not a socialist;
Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out—
    because I was not a trade unionist;
Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—
    because I was not a Jew;
Then they came for me—
    and there was no one left to speak out for me." -- Martin Niemöller]]>

	    <![CDATA["Let someone love you just the way you are – as flawed as you might be, as unattractive as you sometimes feel, and as unaccomplished as you think you are. To believe that you must hide all the parts of you that are broken, out of fear that someone else is incapable of loving what is less than perfect, is to believe that sunlight is incapable of entering a broken window and illuminating a dark room." -- Marc Hack]]>
