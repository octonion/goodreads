		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The only thing worth writing about is people. People. Human beings. Men and women whose individuality must be created, line by line, insight by insight. If you do not do it, the story is a failure. [...] There is no nobler chore in the universe than holding up the mirror of reality and turning it slightly, so we have a new and different perception of the commonplace, the everyday, the 'normal', the obvious. People are reflected in the glass. The fantasy situation into which you thrust them is the mirror itself. And what we are shown should illuminate and alter our perception of the world around us. Failing that, you have failed totally." -- Harlan Ellison]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["We walked for some time, and grew to know each other, as best as we'd allow.  These are some of the high points.  They lack continuity.  I don't apologize.  I merely  pointed it out, adding with some truth, I feel, that most liaisons lack continuity.  We find ourselves in odd places at various times, and for a brief span we link our lives to others and then, our time elapsed, we move apart.  Through a haze of pain occasionally, usually through a veil of memory that clings, then passes, sometimes as though we have never touched." -- Harlan Ellison]]>

	    <![CDATA["The unreal is more powerful than the real. Because nothing is as perfect as you can imagine it. Because its only intangible ideas, concepts, beliefs, fantasies that last. Stone crumbles. Wood rots. People, well, they die. But things as fragile as a thought, a dream, a legend, they can go on and on. If you can change the way people think. The way they see themselves. The way they see the world. You can change the way people live their lives. That's the only lasting thing you can create." -- Chuck Palahniuk]]>
