	    <![CDATA["Life is made up of meetings and partings. People come into your life everyday, you say good morning, you say good evening, some stay for a few minutes, some stay for a few months, some a year, others a whole lifetime. No matter who it is, you meet and then you part. I'm so glad I met you Elizabeth Egan; I'll thank my lucky stars for that. I think I wished for you all of my life&quot; He whispered. &quot;But now it is time for us to part." -- Cecelia Ahern]]>

	    <![CDATA["The important thing is not what we look like, but the role we play in our
best friend’s life. Friends choose certain friends because that’s the kind of company they are looking for at that specific time, not because they’re the
correct height, age, or have the right hair color" -- Cecelia Ahern]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["From the very beginning— from the first moment, I may almost say— of my acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form the groundwork of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry." -- Jane Austen]]>
