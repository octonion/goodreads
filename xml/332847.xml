	    <![CDATA["They were quiet for a time, alone with their thoughts, but then John sat up straight, struck by a thought. &quot;There's a passage in Exodus - God tells Moses, 'No one can see My face, but I will protect you with My hand until I have passed by you, and then I will remove My hand and you will see My back.' Remember that?&quot; 
Emilio nodded, listening. 
Well I always thought that was a physical metaphor,&quot; John said, &quot;but, you know - I wonder now if it isn't really about time? Maybe that was God's way of telling us that we can never know His intentions, but as time goes on...we'll understand. We'll see where He was: we'll see His back." -- Mary Doria Russell]]>
