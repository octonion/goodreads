		<description>
	    <![CDATA["When the fiddle had stopped singing Laura called out softly, &quot;What are days of auld lang syne, Pa?&quot;
&quot;They are the days of a long time ago, Laura,&quot; Pa said. &quot;Go to sleep, now.&quot;
But Laura lay awake a little while, listening to Pa's fiddle softly playing and to the lonely sound of the wind in the Big Woods,…
She was glad that the cozy house, and Pa and Ma and the firelight and the music, were now. They could not be forgotten, she thought, because now is now. It can never be a long time ago." -- Laura Ingalls Wilder]]>

	    <![CDATA["I don't know many rules to live by,' he'd said.  'But here's one. It's simple. Don't put anything unnecessary into yourself. No poisons or chemicals, no fumes or smoke or alcohol, no sharp objects, no inessential needles--drug or tattoo--and...no inessential penises either.'

'Inessential penises?' Karou had repeated, delighted with the phrase in spite of her grief. 'Is there any such thing as an essential one?'

'When an essential one comes along, you'll know,' he'd replied." -- Laini Taylor]]>
