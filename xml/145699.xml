	    <![CDATA["I have always swung back and forth between alienation and relatedness.  As a child, I would run away from the beatings, from the obscene words, and always knew that if I could run far enough, then any leaf, any insect, any bird, any breeze could bring me to my true home.  I knew I did not belong among people.  Whatever they hated about me was a human thing; the nonhuman world has always loved me.  I can't remember when it was otherwise.  But I have been emotionally crippled by this.  There is nothing romantic about being young and angry, or even about turning that anger into art.  I go through the motions of living in society, but never feel a part of it.  When my family threw me away, every human on earth did likewise." -- Wendy Rose]]>

	    <![CDATA["The tears I feel today
I'll wait to shed tomorrow.
Though I'll not sleep this night
Nor find surcease from sorrow.
My eyes must keep their sight:
I dare not be tear-blinded.
I must be free to talk
Not choked with grief, clear-minded.
My mouth cannot betray
The anguish that I know.
Yes, I'll keep my tears til later:
But my grief will never go." -- Anne McCaffrey]]>
