	    <![CDATA["You've got this life and while you've got it, you'd better kiss like you only have one moment, try to hold someone's hand like you will never get another chance to, look into people's eyes like they're the last you'll ever see, watch someone sleeping like there's no time left, jump if you feel like jumping, run if you feel like running, play music in your head when there is none, and eat cake like it's the only one left in the world!" -- C. JoyBell C.]]>

in my mouth.
that rush
through my veins
making my heartache
my pulse quicken
my head-
just a bit dizzy.
my legs-
just a bit numb.
my tongue
years for more
more of you
right now.
now.
i can't wait anymore.
this is torture.
seriously.
i'm in hell.
waiting for you.
i just want to shout
to this giant crowd of people
&quot;how hard is it to make a latte, fuckers?&quot;
i love you, coffee." -- Pamela Ribon]]>

	    <![CDATA["Girls get screwed.
Not that kind of screwed, what I mean is, they're always on the short end of things.

The way things work, how 
guys feel great, but make girls feel
cheap for doing
exactly what 
they beg for.

The way they get to play you, 
all the while claiming they 
love you and making you 
believe it's 
true.

The way it's okay to gift their heart one day, a backhand the next, 
to move on to the apricot
when the peach blushes and bruises.

These things make me believe God's a man after all." -- Ellen  Hopkins]]>

	    <![CDATA["Life is too short to waste any amount of time on wondering what other people think about you. In the first place, if they had better things going on in their lives, they wouldn't have the time to sit around and talk about you. What's important to me is not others' opinions of me, but what's important to me is my opinion of myself." -- C. JoyBell C.]]>
