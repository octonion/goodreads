	    <![CDATA["Eliza—” I said, “so many of the books I’ve read to you said love was the most important thing of all. Maybe I should tell you that I love you now.” 
   “Go ahead,” she said. 
   “I love you, Eliza,” I said.
   She thought about it. “No,” she said at last, “I don’t like it.”
   “Why not?” I said.
          ”It’s as though you were pointing a gun at my head,” she said. “It’s just a   
           way of getting somebody to say something they probably don’t mean. What 
           else can I say, or anybody say, but, ‘I love you, too’?" -- Kurt Vonnegut]]>
