	    <![CDATA["Compassion hurts. When you feel connected to everything, you also feel responsible for everything. And you cannot turn away. Your destiny is bound with the destinies of others. You must either learn to carry the Universe or be crushed by it. You must grow strong enough to love the world, yet empty enough to sit down at the same table with its worst horrors." -- Andrew Boyd]]>

	    <![CDATA["Maddie took the top of her egg off.  The hot bright yolk was like summer sun breaking through cloud.  The first daffodil in the snow.  A gold sovereign wrapped in a white silk handkerchief.  She dipped her spoon in it and licked it." -- Elizabeth Wein]]>
