	    <![CDATA["Aren't you a Republican? Just about everyone is in the whole town of Learning.&quot;

&quot;No, I'm not a Republican. And I'm not no Democrat. I'm not nothing.&quot;

&quot;Why not?&quot;

&quot;Because I'm not allowed to vote.&quot;

&quot;Me either. You have to be twenty-one to vote. I'm only twelve.&quot;

&quot;Reckon I'm soon looking at sixty.&quot;

&quot;Then why can't you vote? Is it because you're a Shaker?&quot;

&quot;No, it's account of I can't read or write. When a man cannot do these things, people think his head is weak. Even when he's proved his back is strong.

&quot;Who decides?&quot;

&quot;Men who look at me and take me not for what I be. Men who only see my mark, my X, when I can't sign my name. They can't see how I true a beam to build our barn, or see that the rows of corn in my field are straight as fences. They just seem me walk the street in Learning in clothes made me by my own woman. They do not care that my coat is strudy and keeps me warm. They'll not care that I owe no debt and I am beholding to no man." -- Robert Newton Peck]]>
