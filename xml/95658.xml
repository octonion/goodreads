	    <![CDATA["What are you doing?&quot; 
&quot;Ya!&quot; said Jane, whirling around, her hands held up menacingly. 
It was Mr. Nobley with coat, hat, and cane, watching her with wide eyes. Jane took several quick (but oh so casual) steps away from Martin's window. 
&quot;Um, did I just say, 'Ya'?&quot; 
&quot;You just said 'Ya,'&quot; he confirmed. &quot;If I am not mistaken, it was a battle cry, warning that you were about to attack me.
I, uh...&quot; She stopped to laugh. &quot;I wasn't aware until this precise and awkward moment that when startled in a startled in a strange place, my instincts would have me pretend to be a ninja." -- Shannon Hale]]>

	    <![CDATA["Derek caught my arm again as I started to move--at this rate, it was going to be as sore as my injured one.
&quot;Dog,&quot; he said, jerking his chin toward the fenced yard.  &quot;It was inside earlier.&quot;
Expecting to see a Doberman slavering at the fence, I followed his gaze to a little puff of white fur, the kind of dog women stick in their purses.  It wasn't even barking, just staring at us, dancing in place.
&quot;Oh, my God!  It's a killer Pomeranian.&quot;  I glanced up at Derek.  &quot;It's a tough call, but I think you can take him." -- Kelley Armstrong]]>

In spite ow what 'women's lib' teaches you, chivalry does not imply that women are powerless. On the contrary, chivalry is an admission of women's superiority. An acknowledgment of &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; power over &lt;i&gt;us&lt;/i&gt;. This is the only form of servitude a Vladescu ever practices, and I perform it gladly for you. You, in turn, are obligated to accept graciously." -- Beth Fantaskey]]>

&quot;What?&quot; I say, wanting to laugh and he hasn't even told me the punch line.
He grins.  Unbelievable how gorgeous he is.  And that he's mine.  He loves me and I love him and how rare and beautiful is that?

Dexter wiped a hand over his face, and glanced down the road. &quot;The women. Indeed, dear squire, they perplex me as well.&quot;
&quot;Ah, the fair Remy,&quot; John Miller said grandly, and I felt a flush run up my face. Lissa, in the front seat, put a hand to her mouth.
&quot;The fair Remy,&quot; Dexter repeated, &quot;did not see me as a worthwhile risk.&quot;
&quot;Indeed.&quot;
&quot;I am, of course, a rogue. A rapscallion. A musician. I would bring her nothing but poverty, shame, and bruised shins from my flailing limbs. She is the better for our parting.&quot;
John Miller pantomined stabbing himself in the heart. &quot;Cold words, my squire.&quot;
&quot;Huffah,&quot; Dexter agreed.
