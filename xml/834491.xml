	    <![CDATA["This is the true joy in life, the being used for a purpose recognized by yourself as a mighty one; the being thoroughly worn out before you are thrown on the scrap heap; the being a force of Nature instead of a feverish selfish little clod of ailments and grievances complaining that the world will not devote itself to making you happy." -- George Bernard Shaw]]>

	    <![CDATA["Well,&quot; said Pooh, &quot;what I like best,&quot; and then he had to stop and think.  Because although Eating Honey was a very good thing to do, there was a moment just before you began to eat it which was better than when you were, but he didn't know what it was called." -- A. A. Milne]]>

	    <![CDATA["I'm selfish, impatient and a little insecure. I make mistakes, I am out of control and at times hard to handle. But if you can't handle me at my worst, then you sure as hell don't deserve me at my best." -- Marilyn Monroe]]>

	    <![CDATA["In communities, at work, but particularly in families, people are put together in something like a three-legged race.  God means us to cross the finish line together, and all the other people tied together with us play some part in our progress.  They are oftentimes to rouse our stubborn sins to the surface, where we can deal with them and overcome them.  Bundled together in families, a giant seven or nine or fifteen legged pack, we seem to make very poor progress indeed and fall to the ground in bickering heaps with some regularity.  But God has put us together - has appointed each person in your bundle specifically for you, and you for them.  And so, 'little children, let us love one another' with might and main, and keep hopping together toward the finish line." -- Frederica Mathewes-Green]]>
