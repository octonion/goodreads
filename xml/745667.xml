There was something distinctly German about the centaurs." -- Lev Grossman]]>

	    <![CDATA["He was indulgent to women and to the poor, oppressed by the weight of society. &quot;The faults of women, children, and servants,&quot; he said, &quot;and of the weak, the poor and the ignorant, are the faults of husbands, fathers and masters, and of the strong, the rich and the learned.&quot; He also said: &quot;Teach the ignorant as much as you can. Society is to blame for not giving free education; it is responsible for the darkness it creates. The soul in darkness sins, but the real sinner is he who caused the darkness." -- Victor Hugo]]>
