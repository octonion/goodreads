	    <![CDATA["Our goal should be to live life in radical amazement.  ....get up in the morning and look at the world in a way that takes nothing for granted.  Everything is phenomenal; everything is incredible; never treat life casually.  To be spiritual is to be amazed." -- Abraham Joshua Heschel]]>

	    <![CDATA["to become aware of the ineffable is to part company with words...the tangent to the curve of human experience lies beyond the limits of language. the world of things we perceive is but a veil.  It’s flutter is music, its ornament science, but what it conceals is inscrutable.  It’s silence remains unbroken; no words can carry it away. Sometimes we wish the world could cry and tell us about that which made it pregnant with fear--filling grandeur.
    Sometimes we wish our own heart would speak of that which made it heavy with wonder.
