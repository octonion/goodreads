	    <![CDATA["Do you think I'm wonderful?  she asked him one day as they leaned against the trunk of a petrified maple.  No, he said.  Why?  Because so many girls are wonderful.  I imagine hundreds of men have called their loves wonderful today, and it's only noon.  You couldn't be something that hundreds of others are." -- Jonathan Safran Foer]]>

	    <![CDATA["I started inventing things, and then I couldn't stop, like beavers, which I know about. People think they cut down trees so they can build dams, but in reality it's because their teeth never stop growing, and if they didn't constantly file them down by cutting through all of those trees, their teeth would start to grow into their own faces, which would kill them. That's how my brain was." -- Jonathan Safran Foer]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["JEWS HAVE SIX SENSES
Touch, taste, sight, smell, hearing … memory.  While Gentiles experience and process the world through the traditional senses, and use memory only as a second-order means of interpreting events, for Jews memory is no less primary than the prick of a pin, or its silver glimmer, or the taste of the blood it pulls from the finger.  The Jew is pricked by a pin and remembers other pins.  It is only by tracing the pinprick back to other pinpricks – when his mother tried to fix his sleeve while his arm was still in it, when his grandfather’s fingers fell asleep from stroking his great-grandfather’s damp forehead, when Abraham tested the knife point to be sure Isaac would feel no pain – that the Jew is able to know why it hurts.
When a Jew encounters a pin, he asks:  What does it remember like?" -- Jonathan Safran Foer]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The disgraced Usurer Yankel D took the baby girl home that evening...  He made a bed of crumpled newspaper in a deep baking pan and gently tucked it in the oven, so that she wouldn't be disturbed by the noise of the small falls outside...  When he pulled her out to feed her or just hold her, her body was tattooed with the newsprint...  Sometimes he would rock her to sleep in his arms, and read her left to right, and know everything he needed to know about the world.  If it wasn't written on her, it wasn't important to him." -- Jonathan Safran Foer]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["And so it was when anyone tried to speak: their minds would become tangled in remembrance. Words became floods of thought with no beginning or end, and would drown the speaker before he could reach the life raft of the point he was trying to make. It was impossible to remember what one meant, what, after all of the words, was intended." -- Jonathan Safran Foer]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The unreal is more powerful than the real. Because nothing is as perfect as you can imagine it. Because its only intangible ideas, concepts, beliefs, fantasies that last. Stone crumbles. Wood rots. People, well, they die. But things as fragile as a thought, a dream, a legend, they can go on and on. If you can change the way people think. The way they see themselves. The way they see the world. You can change the way people live their lives. That's the only lasting thing you can create." -- Chuck Palahniuk]]>

In a world where everybody is waiting for some blind, random disaster or some sudden disease, the addict has the comfort of knowing what will most likely wait for him down the road. He's taken some control over his ultimate fate, and his addiction keeps the cause of his death from being a total surprise." -- Chuck Palahniuk]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Maybe the only thing each of us can see is our own shadow. 

Carl Jung called this his shadow work. He said we never see others. Instead we see only aspects of ourselves that fall over them. Shadows. Projections. Our associations. 

The same way old painters would sit in a tiny dark room and trace the image of what stood outside a tiny window, in the bright sunlight. 

The camera obscura. 

Not the exact image, but everything reversed or upside down." -- Chuck Palahniuk]]>
