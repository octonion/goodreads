	    <![CDATA["Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? 
Thou art more lovely and more temperate: 
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May, 
And summer's lease hath all too short a date: 
Sometimes too hot the eye of heaven shines, 
And too often is his gold complexion dimm'd: 
And every fair from fair sometimes declines, 
By chance or natures changing course untrimm'd; 
By thy eternal summer shall not fade, 
Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest; 
Nor shall Death brag thou wander'st in his shade, 
When in eternal lines to time thou growest: 
So long as men can breathe or eyes can see, 
So long lives this and this gives life to thee." -- William Shakespeare]]>

	    <![CDATA["Some say the world will end in fire,
Some say in ice.
From what I've tasted of desire,
I hold with those who favor fire. 
But if it had to perish twice
I think I know enough of hate
To say that for destruction ice
Is also great
And would suffice." -- Robert Frost]]>

	    <![CDATA["Words, those precious gems of queer shape and gay colours, sharp angles and soft contours, shades of meaning laid one over the other down history, so that for those far back one must delve among the lost  and lovely litter that strews the centuries.  They arrange themselves in the most elegant odd patterns; the sound the strangest sweet euphonious notes; they flute and sing and taber, and disappear, like apparitions, with a curious perfume and a most melodious twang." -- Rose Macaulay]]>
