That's how it is with us.  It's a shame, Kath, because we've loved each other all our lives.  But in the end, we can't stay together forever." -- Kazuo Ishiguro]]>

	    <![CDATA["I'm coming back into focus when Caesar asks him if he has a girlfriend back home. Peeta hesitates, then gives an unconvincing shake of his head.

Handsome lad like you. There must be some special girl. Come on, what’s her name?&quot; says Caesar.

Peeta sighs. &quot;Well, there is this one girl. I’ve had a crush on her ever since I can remember. But I’m pretty sure she didn’t know I was alive until the reaping.&quot;

Sounds of sympathy from the crowd. Unrequited love they can relate to.

She have another fellow?&quot; asks Caesar.

I don’t know, but a lot of boys like her,&quot; says Peeta.

So, here’s what you do. You win, you go home. She can’t turn you down then, eh?&quot; says Caesar encouragingly.

I don’t think it’s going to work out. Winning...won’t help in my case,&quot; says Peeta.

Why ever not?&quot; says Caesar, mystified.

Peeta blushes beet red and stammers out. &quot;Because...because...she came here with me." -- Suzanne Collins]]>

	    <![CDATA["If Peeta and I were both to die, or they thought we were....My fingers fumble with the pouch on my belt, freeing it.  Peeta sees it and his hand clamps on my wrist. &quot;No, I won't let you.&quot; &quot;Trust me,&quot; I whisper. He holds my gaze for a long moment then lets go. I loosen the top of the pouch and pour a few spoonfuls of berries into his palm. Then I fill my own. &quot;On the count of three?&quot; Peeta leans down and kisses me once, very gently. &quot;The count of three,&quot; he says. We stand, our backs pressed together, our empty hands locked tight. &quot;Hold them out. I want everyone to see,&quot; he says. I spread out my fingers, and the dark berries glisten in the sun. I give Peeta's hand one last squeeze as a signal, as a good-bye, and we begin counting. &quot;One.&quot; Maybe I'm wrong. &quot;Two.&quot; Maybe they don't care if we both die. &quot;Three!&quot; It's too late to change my mind. I lift my hand to my mouth taking one last look at the world. The berries have just passed my lips when the trumpets begin to blare. The frantic voice of Claudius Templesmith shouts above them. &quot;Stop! Stop! Ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to present the victors of the 74th Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark!  I give you - the tributes of District 12!" -- Suzanne Collins]]>
