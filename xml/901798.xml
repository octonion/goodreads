	    <![CDATA["The masters of information have forgotten about poetry, where words may have a meaning quite different from what the lexicon says, where the metaphoric spark is always one jump ahead of the decoding function, where another, unforeseen reading is always possible." -- J.M. Coetzee]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["They had been pathetically eager to have the wedding in the family church.  Their reaction though, as far as she could estimate the reactions of people who were now so remote from her, was less elated glee than a quiet, rather smug satisfaction, as though their fears about the effects of her university education, never stated but aways apparent, had been calmed at last.  They had probably been worried she would turn into a high-school teacher or a maiden aunt or a dope addict or a female executive, or that she would undergo some shocking physical transformation, like developing muscles and a deep voice or growing moss." -- Margaret Atwood]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The place didn't look the same but it felt the same; sensations clutched and transformed me.  I stood outside some concrete and plate-glass tower-block, picked a handful of eucalyptus leaves from a branch, crushed them in my hand, smelt, and tears came to my eyes.  Sixty-seven-year-old Claudia, on a pavement awash with packaged American matrons, crying not in grief but in wonder that nothing is ever lost, that everything can be retrieved, that a lifetime is not linear but instant.  That, inside the head, everything happens at once." -- Penelope Lively]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["We open our mouths and out flow words whose ancestries we do not even know. We are walking lexicons. In a single sentence of idle chatter we preserve Latin, Anglo-Saxon, Norse; we carry a museum inside our heads, each day we commemorate people of whom we have never heard. More than that, we speak volumes – our language is the language of everything we have read. Shakespeare and the Authorised Version surface in supermarkets, on buses, chatter on radio and television. I find this miraculous. I never cease to wonder at it. That words are more durable than anything, that they blow with the wind, hibernate and reawaken, shelter parasitic on the most unlikely hosts, survive and survive and survive." -- Penelope Lively]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Children are not like us.  They are beings apart: impenetrable, unapproachable.  They inhabit not our world but a world we have lost and can never recover.  We do not remember childhood -- we imagine it.  We search for it, in vain, through layers of obscuring dust, and recover some bedraggled shreds of what we think it was.  And all the while the inhabitants of this world are among us, like aborigines, like Minoans, people from elsewhere safe in their own time-capsule." -- Penelope Lively]]>
