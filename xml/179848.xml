		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Well, basically there are two sorts of opera,&quot; said Nanny, who also had the true witch's ability to be confidently expert on the basis of no experience whatsoever. &quot;There's your heavy opera, where basically people sing foreign and it goes like &quot;Oh oh oh, I am dyin', oh I am dyin', oh oh oh, that's what I'm doin'&quot;, and there's your light opera, where they sing in foreign and it basically goes &quot;Beer! Beer! Beer! Beer! I like to drink lots of beer!&quot;, although sometimes they drink champagne instead. That's basically all of opera, reely." -- Terry Pratchett]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["See, forgiveness doesn't happen all at once. It's not an event -- it's a process. Forgiveness happens while you're asleep, while you're dreaming, while you're inline at the coffee shop, while you're showering, eating, farting, jerking off. It happens in the back of your mind, and then one day you realize that you don't hate the person anymore, that your anger has gone away somewhere. And you understand. You've forgiven them. You don't know how or why. It sneaked up on you. It happened in the small spaces between thoughts and in the seconds between ideas and blinks. That's where forgiveness happens. Because anger and hatred, when left unfed, bleed away like air from a punctured tire, over time and days and years. Forgiveness is stealth. At least, that's what I hope." -- Barry Lyga]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the western spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun. Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-two million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape-descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea." -- Douglas Adams]]>

	    <![CDATA["I like writing that is restrained and invisible. I don't mean that I like things to be simple and easy to decode, the opposite. I like writers who deal with ambiguities, biased viewpoint and subjective truth; I like the writing to be clean but everything behind the writing to be complex. I like to feel that there are things going on in the spaces and behind the lines." -- S.U. Pacat]]>

	    <![CDATA["Never mind that it's not owned by a black person anymore. You can still learn a lot from BET. Primarily, you will learn that black people love reruns, and if you're lucky, you'll catch the Tyler Perry movie! I know the Internet Movie Database says Perry has written over ten films, and there may be several titles and even different casts, but if you've seen one Tyler Perry movie, you've experienced the entire cannon. The man has only made one film, and you can catch it on BET, repeatedly." -- Baratunde Thurston]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["There are three possible parts to a date, of which at least two must be offered: entertainment, food, and affection. It is customary to begin a series of dates with a great deal of entertainment, a moderate amount of food, and the merest suggestion of affection. As the amount of affection increases, the entertainment can be reduced proportionately. When the affection IS the entertainment, we no longer call it dating. Under no circumstances can the food be omitted." -- Judith Martin]]>
