It demanded to be accepted by simple faith, not dissected or questioned, and at the same time, it begged to be doubted and probed." -- Charles de Lint]]>

At the same time I know that this can never be.  The world has grown so complex that one voice can do little to alter it any longer.  That doesn't stop me from doing what I can, but it makes the task hard.  The successes are so small, the failures so large and many.  It's like trying to stem a storm with one's bare hands." -- Charles de Lint]]>

Of course, in honest moments.  But I can be just as honest and think that we aren't a spiritual waste but a spiritual potential waiting to grow." -- Deepak Chopra]]>
