		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Once on a yellow piece of paper with green lines
	he wrote a poem
And he called it &quot;Chops&quot;
	because that was the name of his dog

And that's what it was all about
And his teacher gave him an A
	and a gold star
And his mother hung it on the kitchen door
	and read it to his aunts
That was the year Father Tracy
	took all the kids to the zoo

And he let them sing on the bus
And his little sister was born
	with tiny toenails and no hair
And his mother and father kissed a lot
And the girl around the corner sent him a
Valentine signed with a row of X's

	and he had to ask his father what the X's meant
And his father always tucked him in bed at night
And was always there to do it

Once on a piece of white paper with blue lines
	he wrote a poem
And he called it &quot;Autumn&quot;

	because that was the name of the season
And that's what it was all about
And his teacher gave him an A
	and asked him to write more clearly
And his mother never hung it on the kitchen door
	because of its new paint

And the kids told him
	that Father Tracy smoked cigars
And left butts on the pews
And sometimes they would burn holes
That was the year his sister got glasses
	with thick lenses and black frames
And the girl around the corner laughed

	when he asked her to go see Santa Claus
And the kids told him why
	his mother and father kissed a lot
And his father never tucked him in bed at night
And his father got mad
	when he cried for him to do it.


Once on a paper torn from his notebook
	he wrote a poem
And he called it &quot;Innocence: A Question&quot;
	because that was the question about his girl
And that's what it was all about
And his professor gave him an A

	and a strange steady look
And his mother never hung it on the kitchen door
	because he never showed her
That was the year that Father Tracy died
And he forgot how the end
	of the Apostle's Creed went

And he caught his sister
	making out on the back porch
And his mother and father never kissed
	or even talked
And the girl around the corner
	wore too much makeup
That made him cough when he kissed her

	but he kissed her anyway
	because that was the thing to do
And at three a.m. he tucked himself into bed
	his father snoring soundly

That's why on the back of a brown paper bag
	he tried another poem

And he called it &quot;Absolutely Nothing&quot;
Because that's what it was really all about
And he gave himself an A
	and a slash on each damned wrist
And he hung it on the bathroom door
	because this time he didn't think

	he could reach the kitchen." -- Stephen Chbosky]]>

	    <![CDATA["I think that if I ever have kids, and they are upset, I won't tell them that people are starving in China or anything like that because it wouldn't change the fact that they were upset. And even if somebody else has it much worse, that doesn't really change the fact that you have what you have." -- Stephen Chbosky]]>
