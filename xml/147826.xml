	    <![CDATA["Russ decided the best defense was a good offense. &quot;I'm Russell Van Alstyne, Millers Kill chrief of police.&quot; He held out his hand. She shook firm, like a guy.

&quot;Clare Fergusson,&quot; she said. &quot;I'm the new priest at Saint Alban's. That's the Episcopal Church. At the corner of Elm and Church.&quot; there was a faint testiness in her voice. Russ relaxed a fraction. A woman priest. If that didn't beat all.

&quot;I know which it is. There are only four churches in town.&quot; He saw the fog creeping along the edges of his glasses again and snatched them off, fishing for a tissue in his pocket. &quot;Can you tell me what happened, um...&quot; What was he supposed to call her? &quot;Mother?&quot;

&quot;I go by Reverend, Chief. Ms. is fine, too.&quot;

&quot;Oh. Sorry. I never met a woman priest before.&quot;

&quot;We're just like the men priests, except we're willing to pull over and ask directions." -- Julia Spencer-Fleming]]>
