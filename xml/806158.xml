		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The many troubles in your household will tend to your edification, if you strive to bear them all in gentleness, patience, and kindness.  Keep this ever before you, and remember constantly that God's loving eyes are upon you amid all these little worries and vexations, watching whether you take them as He would desire.  Offer up all such occasions to Him, and if sometimes you are put out, and give way to impatience, do not be discouraged, but make haste to regain your lost composure." -- Francis De Sales]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["If we wished to gain contentment, we might try such rules as these: 
1.  Allow thyself to complain of nothing, not even of the weather. 
2.  Never picture thyself to thyself under any circumstances in which thou art not. 
3.  Never compare thine own lot with that of another. 
4.  Never allow thyself to dwell on the wish that this or that had been, or were, otherwise than it was, or is.  God Almighty loves thee better and more wisely than thou dost thyself. 
5.  Never dwell on the morrow.  Remember that it is God's, not thine.  The heaviest part of sorrow often is to look forward to it.  &quot;The Lord will provide." -- Edward Bouverie Pusey]]>

	    <![CDATA["You know, I once read an interesting book which said that, uh, most people lost in the wilds, they, they die of shame.  Yeah, see, they die of shame. 'What did I do wrong? How could I have gotten myself into this?' And so they sit there and they... die. Because they didn't do the one thing that would save their lives. Thinking." -- David Mamet]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["There are only two possibilities in life:

1.  Things don't always go the way you want, and you don't understand why you're having trouble; yet there is a hand of providence behind everything and a purpose for all that happens. 

2.  Things don't always go the way you want, and you don't understand why you're having trouble; but there is no hand of providence behind everything and no purpose for all that happens.  

The first possibility gives hope in the midst of trials, the second produces only despair." -- Fred Klett]]>
