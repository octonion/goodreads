		<description>
	    <![CDATA["How much evil throughout history could have been avoided had people exercised their moral acuity with convictional courage and said to the powers that be, 'No, I will not.  This is wrong, and I don't care if you fire me, shoot me, pass me over for promotion, or call my mother, I will not participate in this unsavory activity.'  Wouldn't world history be rewritten if just a few people had actually acted like individual free agents rather than mindless lemmings?" -- Joel Salatin]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["On a grander scale, when a society segregates itself, the consequences affect the economy, the emotions, and the ecology. That's one reason why it's easy for pro-lifers to eat factory-raised animals that disrespect everything sacred about creation. And that is why it's easy for rabid environmentalists to hate chainsaws even though they snuggle into a mattress supported by a black walnut bedstead." -- Joel Salatin]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["A farm includes the passion of the farmer's heart, the interest of the farm's customers, the biological activity in the soil, the pleasantness of the air about the farm -- it's everything touching, emanating from, and supplying that piece of landscape.  A farm is virtually a living organism.  The tragedy of our time is that cultural philosophies and market realities are squeezing life's vitality out of most farms.  And that is why the average farmer is now 60 years old.  Serfdom just doesn't attract the best and brightest." -- Joel Salatin]]>

	    <![CDATA["We don't need a law against McDonald's or a law against slaughterhouse abuse--we ask for too much salvation by legislation. All we need to do is empower individuals with the right philosophy and the right information to opt out en masse." -- Joel Salatin]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The first supermarket supposedly appeared on the American landscape in 1946.  That is not very long ago.  Until then, where was all the food?  Dear folks, the food was in homes, gardens, local fields, and forests.  It was near kitchens, near tables, near bedsides.  It was in the pantry, the cellar, the backyard." -- Joel Salatin]]>
