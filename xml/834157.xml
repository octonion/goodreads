	    <![CDATA["Our revels now are ended. These our actors,         
As I foretold you, were all spirits and  
Are melted into air, into thin air:  
And, like the baseless fabric of this vision,  
The cloud-cappâ€™d towers, the gorgeous palaces,  
The solemn temples, the great globe itself,         
Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve  
And, like this insubstantial pageant faded,  
Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff  
As dreams are made on, and our little life  
Is rounded with a sleep." -- William Shakespeare]]>
