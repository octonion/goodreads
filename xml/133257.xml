	    <![CDATA["Shakespeare, Leonardo da Vinci, Benjamin Franklin and Abraham Lincoln never saw a movie, heard a radio or looked at television.  They had 'Loneliness' and knew what to do with it.  They were not afraid of being lonely because they knew that was when the creative mood in them would work." -- Carl Sandburg]]>

	    <![CDATA["And when the universe has finished exploding all the stars will slow down, like a ball that has been thrown into the air, and they will come to a halt and they will all begin to fall towards the centre of the universe again. And then there will be nothing to stop us seeing all the stars in the world because they will all be moving towards us, gradually faster and faster, and we will know that the world is going to end soon because when we look up into the sky at night there will be no darkness, just the blazing light of billions and billions of stars, all falling." -- Mark Haddon]]>
