	    <![CDATA["Nothing ever begins. 
There is no first moment; no single word or place from which this or any story springs. 
The threads can always be traced back to some earlier tale, and the tales that preceded that; though as the narrator's voice recedes the connections will seem to grow more tenuous, for each age will want the tale told as if it were of its own making." -- Clive Barker]]>

	    <![CDATA["You cut up a thing that's alive and beautiful to find out how it's alive and why it's beautiful, and before you know it, it's neither of those things, and you're standing there with blood on your face and tears in your sight and only the terrible ache of guilt to show for it." -- Clive Barker]]>
