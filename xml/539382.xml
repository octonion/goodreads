	    <![CDATA["It is more than probable that I am not understood; but I fear, indeed, that it is in no manner possible to convey to the mind of the merely general reader, an adequate idea of that nervous intensity of interest with which, in my case, the powers of meditation (not to speak technically) busied and buried themselves, in the contemplation of even the most ordinary objects of the universe." -- Edgar Allan Poe]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["There is eloquence in the tongueless
wind, and a melody in the flowing brooks and the rustling of the
reeds beside them, which by their inconceivable relation to something
within the soul, awaken the spirits to a dance of breathless
rapture, and bring tears of mysterious tenderness to the eyes, like
the enthusiasm of patriotic success, or the voice of one beloved
singing to you alone." -- Percy Bysshe Shelley]]>

	    <![CDATA["To comprehend Crowley, one must comprehend what he meant by &quot;Magick&quot;—the &quot;discredited&quot; tradition he swore to &quot;rehabilitate.&quot;

Magick, for Crowley, is a way of life that takes in every facet of life.  The keys to attainment within the magical tradition lie in the proper training of the human psyche itself—more specifically, in the development of the powers of will and imagination.  The training of the will—which Crowley so stressed, thus placing himself squarely within that tradition—is the focusing of one's energy, one's essential being.  The imagination provides, as it were, the target for this focus, by its capacity to ardently envision—and hence bring into magical being—possibilities and states beyond those of consensual reality.  The will and imagination must work synergistically.  For the will, unilluminated by imagination, becomes a barren tool of earthly pursuits.  And the imagination, ungoverned by a striving will, lapses into idle dreams and stupor." -- Lawrence Sutin]]>
