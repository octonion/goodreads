	    <![CDATA["I picked up one of the books and flipped through it.  Don't get me wrong, I like reading.  But some books should come with warning labels: Caution: contains characters and plots guaranteed to induce sleepiness.  Do not attempt to operate heavy machinery after ingesting more than one chapter.  Has been known to cause blindness, seizures and a terminal loathing of literature.  Should only be taken under the supervision of a highly trained English teacher.  Preferably one who grades on the curve." -- Laurie Halse Anderson]]>
