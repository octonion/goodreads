		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The earth was warm under me, and warm as I crumbled it through my fingers...I kept as still as I could.  Nothing happened.  I did not expect anything to happen.  I was something that lay under the sun and felt it, like the pumpkins, and I did not want to be anything more.  I was entirely happy.  Perhaps we feel like that when we die and become a part of something entire, whether it is sun and air, or goodness and knowledge.  At any rate, that is happiness; to be dissolved into something complete and great.  When it comes to one, it comes as naturally as sleep." -- Willa Cather]]>

	    <![CDATA["Yet the summer which was to change everything was coming nearer every day.  When boys and girls are growing up, life can't stand still, not even in the quietest of country towns; and they have to grow up, whether they will or no.  That is what their elders are always forgetting." -- Willa Cather]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I wanted to walk straight on through the red grass and over the edge of the world, which could not be very far away.  The light and air abot me told me that the world ended here:  only the ground and sun and sky were left, and if one went a little farther there would only be sun and sky, and one would float off into them, like the tawny hawks which sailed over our heads making slow shadows on the grass." -- Willa Cather]]>

	    <![CDATA["Thw windy springs and the blazing summers, one after another, had enriched and mellowed that flat tableland; all the human effort that had gone into it was coming back in long, sweeping lines of fertility.  The changes seemed beautiful and harmonious to me; it was like watching the growth of a great man or a great idea." -- Willa Cather (My Antonia)]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Still Dev missed him.  Not all the time or even very often, but now and then, missing would hit Dev, throw him off balance, a sudden, undeniable ache to know his father, how his voice sounded, what his face did when he read the paper or looked at his son.  And the missing wasn't fair; it wasn't earned.  In fact, the missing, the searching, the imagining were so unfair that when you put them all together, they looked a lot like betrayal." -- Marisa de los Santos]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Knowing can be a curse on a person's life. I'd traded in a pack of lies for a pack of truth, and I didn't know which one was heavier. Which one took the most strength to carry around? It was a ridiculous question, though, because once you know the truth, you can't ever go back and pick up your suitcase of lies. Heavier or not, the truth is yours now." -- Sue Monk Kidd]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["When you are five, you know your age down to the month.  Even in your twenties, you know how old you are. I'm twenty-three you say, or maybe twenty-seven. But then in your thirties, something strange starts to happen.  It is a mere hiccup at first, an instant of hesitation.  How old are you?  Oh, I'm--you start confidently, but then you stop.  You were going to say thirty-three, but you are not.  You're thirty-five.  And then you're bothered, because you wonder if this is the beginning of the end.  It is, of course, but it's decades before you admit it." -- Sara Gruen]]>

Then, after I met Miss Debbie and Mr. Ron, I worried that I was so different from them that we wadn't ever gon' have no kind a' future.  But I found out everybody's different - the same kind of different as me.  We're all just regular folks walkin down the road God done set in front of us.  The truth about it is, whether we is rich or poor or somethin in between, this earth ain't no final restin place.  So in a way, we is all homeless - just workin our way toward home." -- Denver Moore]]>

	    <![CDATA["Among other things, you'll find that you're not the first person who was ever confused and frightened and even sickened by human behavior. You're by no means alone on that score, you'll be excited and stimulated to know. Many, many men have been just as troubled morally and spiritually as you are right now. Happily, some of them kept records of their troubles. You'll learn from them—if you want to. Just as someday, if you have something to offer, someone will learn something from you. It's a beautiful reciprocal arrangement. And it isn't education. It's history. It's poetry." -- J.D. Salinger]]>
