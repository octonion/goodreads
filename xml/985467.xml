	    <![CDATA["Why do I read?
I just can't help myself.
I read to learn and to grow, to laugh   
 and to be motivated.
I read to understand things I've never 
 been exposed to.
I read when I'm crabby, when I've just 
 said monumentally dumb things to the 
 people I love.
I read for strength to help me when I 
 feel broken, discouraged, and afraid.
I read when I'm angry at the whole 
 world.
I read when everything is going right.
I read to find hope.
I read because I'm made up not just of 
 skin and bones, of sights, feelings, 
 and a deep need for chocolate, but I'm 
 also made up of words.
Words describe my thoughts and what's
 hidden in my heart.
Words are alive--when I've found a
 story that I love, I read it again and
 again, like playing a favorite song 
 over and over.
Reading isn't passive--I enter the
 story with the characters, breathe
 their air, feel their frustrations,
 scream at them to stop when they're
 about to do something stupid, cry with
 them, laugh with them.
Reading for me, is spending time with a
 friend.
A book is a friend.
You can never have too many." -- Gary Paulsen]]>
