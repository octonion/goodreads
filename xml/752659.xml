	    <![CDATA["[Stephanie] &quot;This won't be so bad,&quot; I said to her, making an effort at convincing myself. &quot;How about your blanket? We could wrap him up in the blanket. Then we could pick him up without actually touching him.&quot; 

&quot;I suppose that'd be all right,&quot; Lula said. &quot;We could give it a try&quot; 

I spread the blanket on the ground beside Elliot Harp, took a deep breath, hooked my fingers around his belt and rolled him onto the blanket. I jumped back, squeezed my eyes closed tight and exhaled. No matter how much violent death I saw, I would never get used to it. &quot;I'm gonna definitely have the runs,&quot; Lula said. &quot;I can feel it coming on.&quot; 

&quot;Forget about the runs and help me with this body!&quot;  Lula grabbed hold of the head end of the blanket, and I grabbed hold of the foot end. Harp had full rigor and wouldn't bend, so we put him in the trunk headfirst with his legs sticking out. We carefully closed the lid on Harp's knees and secured the lid with a piece of rope Lula had in her trunk.  

&quot;Hold on,&quot; Lula said, pulling a red flowered scarf from her coat pocket, tying the scarf on Harp's foot like a flag. &quot;Don't want to get a ticket. I hear the police are real picky about having things sticking out of your trunk.&quot; 

Especially dead guys." -- Janet Evanovich]]>

	    <![CDATA["I'm not sure what I am.  I just know there's something dark in me.  I hide it.  I certainly don't talk about it, but it's there always, this Dark Passenger.  And when he's driving, I feel alive, half sick with the thrill of complete wrongness.  I don't fight him, I don't want to.  He's all I've got.  Nothing else could love me, not even... especially not me.  Or is that just a lie the Dark Passenger tells me?  Because lately there are these moments when I feel connected to something else... someone.  It's like the mask is slipping and things... people... who never mattered before are suddenly starting to matter.  It scares the hell out of me." -- Jeff Lindsay]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Addie, please.&quot; More tears dripped down her cheeks. &quot;Don't be so hard.&quot;
&quot;Oh, please,&quot; I muttered...and that was as far as I got. 'You broke my heart' were the words that had risen to my mouth, but I couldn't say them. That was what you said to a boyfriend, a lover, not your best friend. She'd laugh. And I'd had enough of being laughed at. I'd worked hard to get to a place where it didn't happen anymore, where I didn't move through life like a walking target, where it was just me and my paints and brushes and my big empty bed every night. &quot;You weren't a good friend,&quot; I said instead." -- Jennifer Weiner]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I am not shy about admitting my modest talents.  For example, I am happy to admit that I am better than average at clever remarks, and I also have a flair for getting people to like me.  But to be perfectly fair to myself, I am ever-ready to confess my shortcomings, too, and a quick round of soul-searching forced me to admit that I had never been any good at all at breathing water.  As I hung there from the seat belt, dazed and watching the water pour in and swirl around my head, this began to seem like a very large character flaw." -- Jeff Lindsay]]>

No wonder our world was such a mean and violent place...if we teach children that killing is fun, can we really be surprised if now and then someone is smart enough to learn?" -- Jeff Lindsay]]>
