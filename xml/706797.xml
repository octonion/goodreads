	    <![CDATA["He has achieved success who has lived well, laughed often, and loved much;
Who has enjoyed the trust of pure women, the respect of intelligent men and the love of little children;
Who has filled his niche and accomplished his task;
Who has never lacked appreciation of Earth's beauty or failed to express it;
Who has left the world better than he found it,
Whether an improved poppy, a perfect poem, or a rescued soul;
Who has always looked for the best in others and given them the best he had;
Whose life was an inspiration;
Whose memory a benediction." -- Bessie Anderson Stanley]]>

But conversely, the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man&amp;mdash;for precisely the same reasons." -- Douglas Adams]]>

I am in the next seat.
My shoulder is against yours.

not in masses, 
nor kirtans, 
not in legs winding around your own neck, 
nor in eating nothing but vegetables.
When you really look for me, 
you will see me instantly —
you will find me in the tiniest house of time.
Kabir says: Student, tell me, what is God? 
He is the breath inside the breath." -- Kabir]]>
