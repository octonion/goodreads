		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The rims of his eyelids were burning. A blow received straightens a man up and makes the body move forward, to return that blow, or a punch-to jump, to get a hard-on, to dance: to be alive.  But a blow received may also cause you to bend over, to shake, to fall down, to die.  When we see life, we call it beautiful.  When we see death, we call it ugly.  But it is more beautiful still to see oneself living at great speed, right up to the moment of death.  Detectives, poets, domestic servants and priests rely on abjection.  From it, they draw their power.  It circulates in their veins.  It nourishes them." -- Jean Genet]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["In spite of everything I loved you, and will go on loving you―on my knees, with my shoulders drawn back, showing my heels to the headsman and straining my goose neck―even then.  And afterwards―perhaps most of all afterwards―I shall love you, and one day we shall have a real, all-embracing explanation, and then perhaps we shall somehow fit together, you and I, and turn ourselves in such a way that we form one pattern, and solve the puzzle: draw a line from point A to point B... without looking, or, without lifting the pencil... or in some other way... we shall connect the points, draw the line, and you and I shall form that unique design for which I yearn.  If they do this kind of thing to me every morning, they will get me trained and I shall become quite wooden." -- Vladimir Nabokov]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Children of her type contrive the purest philosophies. Ada had worked out her own little system. Hardly a week had elapsed since Van’s arrival when he was found worthy of being initiated in her web of wisdom. An individual’s life consisted of certain classified things: &quot;real things&quot; which were unfrequent and priceless, simply &quot;things&quot; which formed the routine stuff of life; and &quot;ghost things,&quot; also called &quot;fogs,&quot; such as fever, toothache, dreadful disappointments, and death. Three or more things occurring at the same time formed a &quot;tower,&quot; or, if they came in immediate succession, they made a &quot;bridge.&quot; &quot;Real towers&quot; and &quot;real bridges&quot; were the joys of life, and when the towers came in a series, one experienced supreme rapture; it almost never happened, though. In some circumstances, in a certain light, a neutral &quot;thing&quot; might look or even actually become &quot;real&quot; or else, conversely, it might coagulate into a fetid &quot;fog.&quot; When the joy and the joyless happened to be intermixed, simultaneously or along the ramp of duration, one was confronted with &quot;ruined towers&quot; and &quot;broken bridges." -- Vladimir Nabokov]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The sky was so heartless and dark, and her body, her head, and particularly those damned thirsty trousers, felt clogged with Oceanus Nox, n,o,x. At every slap and splash of cold wild salt, she heaved with anise-flavored nausea and there was an increasing number, okay, or numbness in her neck and arms. As she began losing track of herself, she thought it proper to inform a series of receding Lucettes -- telling them to pass it on and on in a trick-crystal regression -- that what death amounted to was only a more complete assortment of the infinite fractions of solitude." -- Vladimir Nabokov]]>

	    <![CDATA["And you really will have to make it through that violent, metaphysical, symbolic storm. No matter how metaphysical or symbolic it might be, make no mistake about it: it will cut through flesh like a thousand razor blades. People will bleed there, and you will bleed too. Hot, red blood. You'll catch that blood in your hands, your own blood and the blood of others. And once the storm is over you won't remember how you made it through, how you managed to survive. You won't even be sure, in fact, whether the storm is really over. But one thing is certain. When you come out of the storm you won't be the same person who walked in. That's what this storm's all about." -- Haruki Murakami]]>

	    <![CDATA["There is a loneliness that can be rocked.  Arms crossed, knees drawn up, holding, holding on, this motion, unlike a ship's, smooths and contains the rocker.  It's an inside kind--wrapped tight like skin.  Then there is the loneliness that roams.  No rocking can hold it down.  It is alive.  On its own.  A dry and spreading thing that makes the sound of one's own feet going seem to come from a far-off place." -- Toni Morrison]]>
