		<description>
	    <![CDATA["If you have never wept bitter tears because a wonderful story has come to an end and you must take your leave of the characters with whom you have shared so many adventures, whom you have loved and admired, for whom you have hoped and feared, and without whose company life seems empty and meaningless.

If such things have not been part of your own experience, you probably won't understand what Bastian did next." -- Michael Ende]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["People never seemed to notice that, by saving time, they were losing something else.  No one cared to admit that life was becoming ever poorer, bleaker and more monotonous.  The ones who felt this most keenly were the children, because no one had time for them any more.  But time is life itself, and life resides in the human heart.  And the more people saved, the less they had." -- Michael Ende]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["This sentence has five words. Here are five more words. Five-word sentences are fine. But several together become monotonous. Listen to what is happening. The writing is getting boring. The sound of it drones. It’s like a stuck record. The ear demands some variety. Now listen. I vary the sentence length, and I create music. Music. The writing sings. It has a pleasant rhythm, a lilt, a harmony. I use short sentences. And I use sentences of medium length. And sometimes, when I am certain the reader is rested, I will engage him with a sentence of considerable length, a sentence that burns with energy and builds with all the impetus of a crescendo, the roll of the drums, the crash of the cymbals–sounds that say listen to this, it is important." -- Gary Provost]]>
