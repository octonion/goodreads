		<description>
	    <![CDATA["In a car you're always in a compartment, and because you're used to it you don't realize that through that car window everything you see is just more TV.  You're a passive observer and it is all moving by you boringly in a frame.  

On a cycle the frame is gone.  You're completely in contact with it all.  You're &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; the scene, not just watching it anymore, and the sense of presence is overwhelming." -- Robert M. Pirsig]]>

	    <![CDATA["You’ve got to live right, too. It’s the way you live that predisposes you to avoid the traps and see the right facts. You want to know how to paint a perfect painting? It’s easy. Make yourself perfect and then just paint naturally. That’s the way all the experts do it. The making of a painting or the fixing of a motorcycle isn’t separate from the rest of your existence. If you’re a sloppy thinker the six days of the week you aren’t working on your machine, what trap avoidance, what gimmicks, can make you all of a sudden sharp on the seventh? It all goes together ... The real cycle you're working in is a cycle called yourself. The machine that appears to be &quot;out there&quot; and the person that appears to be &quot;in here&quot; are not two separate things. They grow toward Qaulity or fall away from Qaulity together." -- Robert M. Pirsig]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Any effort that has self-glorification as its final destination is bound to end in disaster.When you try to climb a mountain to prove how big you are, you almost never make it. And even if you do,it's a hollow victory. In order to sustain the victory, you have to prove yourself again and again in some other way, and again and again and again, driven forever to fill a false image, haunted by the fear that the image is not true and someone will find out. That's never the way." -- Robert Pirsig]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Of the value traps, the most widespread and pernicious is value rigidity. This is an inability to revalue what one sees because of commitment to previous values. In motorcycle maintenance, you MUST rediscover what you do as you go.  Rigid values makes this impossible." -- Robert M. Pirsig]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["So green this summer and so fresh. There are white and gold daisies among the grass in front of an old wire fence, a meadow with some cows and far in the distance a low rising of the land with something golden on it. Hard to know what it is. No need to know." -- Robert M. Pirsig]]>

	    <![CDATA["If you get careless or go romanticizing scientific information, giving it a flourish here and there, Nature will soon make a complete fool out of you.  It does it often enough anyway even when you don't give it opportunities." -- Robert M. Pirsig]]>
