	    <![CDATA["There are many roles that people play and many images that they project. There is, for example, the &quot;nice&quot; man who is always smiling and agreeable. &quot;Such a nice man,&quot; people say. &quot;He never gets angry.&quot; The facade always covers its opposite expression. Inside, such a person is full of rage that he dares not acknowledge or show. Some men put up a tough exterior to hide a very sensitive, childlike quality. Even failure can be a role. Many masochistic characters engage in the game of failure to cover an inner feeling of superiority. An outward show of superiority could bring down on them the jealous wrath of the father and the threat of castration. As long as they act like failures they can retain some sexuality, since they are not a threat to her father." -- Alexander Lowen]]>
