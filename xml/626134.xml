	    <![CDATA["Why should our rulers, normally phlegmatic men, react with sudden hysteria to the pinpricks of terrorism when for decades they were able to go about their everyday business unruffled, in full awareness that in a deep bunker somewhere in the Urals an enemy watched and waited with a finger on a button, ready if provoked to wipe them and their cities from the face of the earth?" -- J.M. Coetzee]]>

	    <![CDATA["A few days ago I heard a performance of the Sibelius fifth symphony. As the closing bars approached, I experienced exactly the large, swelling emotion that the music was written to elicit. What would it have been like, I wondered, to be a Finn in the audience at the first performance of the symphony in Helsinki nearly a century ago, and feel that swell overtake one? The answer: one would have felt proud, proud that one of us could put together such sounds, proud that out of nothing we human beings can make such stuff. Contrast with that oneÂ´s feelings of shame that we, our people, have made Guantanamo. Musical creation on the one hand, a machine for inflicting pain and humiliation on the other: the best and the worst that human beings are capable of." -- J.M. Coetzee]]>

	    <![CDATA["Home.  When it rains, you can smell the leaves in the forest and the sand.  It's all so small and mild, the landscape surrounding the lake, so manageable.  The leaves and the sand are so close, it's as if you might, if you wanted, pull them on over your head.  And the lake always laps at the shore so gently, licking the hand you dip into it like a young dog, and the water is soft and shallow." -- Jenny Erpenbeck]]>
