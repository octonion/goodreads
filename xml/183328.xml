	    <![CDATA["Rebecca was an academic star. Her new book was on the phenomenon of word casings, a term she'd invented for words that no longer had meaning outside quotation marks. English was full of these empty words--&quot;friend&quot; and &quot;real&quot; and &quot;story&quot; and &quot;change&quot;--words that had been shucked of their meanings and reduced to husks. Some, like &quot;identity&quot; and &quot;search&quot; and &quot;cloud,&quot; had clearly been drained of life by their Web usage. With others, the reasons were more complex; how had &quot;American&quot; become an ironic term? How had &quot;democracy&quot; come to be used in an arch, mocking way?" -- Jennifer Egan]]>
