	    <![CDATA["You're an interesting species. An interesting mix. You're capable of such beautiful dreams, and such horrible nightmares. You feel so lost, so cut off, so alone, only you're not.

Isaboe gave a small gasp when he leaned forward, his lips an inch away from hers. &quot;I will die for you,&quot; he whispered.
