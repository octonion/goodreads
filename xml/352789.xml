		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["There are two kinds of love...in the safe kind you look for someone who's exactly like you. It's what most folks settle for. But then there's the other kind of love. Everyone's born with a ragged edge, and some folks crave that piece that's a perfect fit. You'll search for it forever, if you have to. And if you're lucky enough to find it, it looks so &lt;I&gt;right&lt;/I&gt;, you start to tear at your own seams, thinking, &lt;I&gt;maybe I could look just as perfect&lt;/I&gt;. But then, of course, when you try to get close to their other half, you don't fit anymore. That kind of love...you come out of it a different person than you were when you started." -- Jodi Picoult]]>
