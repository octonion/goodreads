	    <![CDATA["For ever and ever, we say when we are young, or in our prayers. Twice, we say it. Old One, do we not? For ever and ever ... so that a thing may be for ever, a life or a love or a quest, and yet begin again, and be for ever just as before. And any ending that may seem to come is not truly an ending, but an illusion. For Time does not die, Time has neither beginning nor end, and so nothing can end or die that has once had a place in Time." -- Susan Cooper]]>

	    <![CDATA["You said 'God is cruel' the way a person who's lived his whole life on Tahiti might say 'Snow is cold'. You knew, but you didn't understand.&quot; He stepped close to David and put his palms on the boy's cold cheeks. &quot;Do you know how cruel your God can be, David. How fantastically cruel?" -- Stephen King]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["In many interviews he had identified himself as a man outraged by death, but that was pretty much the same old big-balls crap he'd been selling throughout his career.  He was &lt;i&gt;terrified&lt;/i&gt; of death, that was the truth, and as a result of spending his life honing his imagination, he could see it coming from at least four dozen different directions... and late at night when he couldn't sleep, he was apt to see it coming from four dozen different directions &lt;i&gt;at once&lt;/i&gt;.  Refusing to see the doctor, to have a checkup and let them peek under the hood, would not cause any of those diseases to pause in their approach or their feeding upon him--if, indeed, the feeding had already begun--but if he stayed away from the doctors and their devilish machines, &lt;i&gt;he wouldn't have to know&lt;/i&gt;.  You didn't have to deal with the monster under the bed or lurking in the corner if you never actually turned on the bedroom lights, that was the thing.  And what no doctor in the world seemed to know was that, for men like Johnny Marinville, fearing was sometimes better than finding.  Especially when you'd put out the welcome mat for every disease going." -- Stephen King]]>

	    <![CDATA["I do not aim with my hand; he who aims with his hand has forgotten the face of his father.
I aim with my eye.

I do not shoot with my hand; he who shoots with his hand has forgotten the face of his father.
I shoot with my mind.

I do not kill with my gun; he who kills with his gun has forgotten the face of his father.
I kill with my heart." -- Stephen King]]>
