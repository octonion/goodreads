		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Barrons Books and Baubles had been ransacked! 
 
Tables were overturned, books torn from shelves and strewn everywhere, baubles broken. Even my little TV behind the counter had been destroyed. 
 
&quot;Barrons?&quot; I called warily. It was night and the lights were on. My illusory Alina had told me more than an hour had passed. Was it the same night, nearly dawn? Or was it the night following our theft attempt? Had Barrons come back from Wales yet? Or was he still there, searching for me? When I‘d been so rudely ripped from reality, who or what had come through those basement doors? 
 
I heard footsteps, boots on hardwood, and turned expectantly toward the connecting doors. 
 
Barrons was framed in the doorway. His eyes were black ice. He stared at me a moment, raking me from head to toe. &quot;Nice tan, Ms. Lane. So, where the fuck have you been for the past month?" -- Karen Marie Moning]]>

We don't drink light beer, drive Smart cars, or admit to knowing the names of more than about five or six colors. And we don't wax our chests, ever." -- Lisa Kleypas]]>

I turned my back to him with a shrug. “I named my ovaries, too, but they don’t get out as much." -- Darynda Jones]]>

	    <![CDATA["What? I took it because of the girls in the class. Anyway, I see a bit of a &lt;i&gt;P and P&lt;/i&gt; dynamic going on between you and Payton.&quot;

J.D. didn't think he wanted to know. Really. But he asked anyway. &quot;&lt;i&gt;P and P&lt;/i&gt;?&quot;

Tyler shot him a look, appalled. &quot;Uh, hello--&lt;i&gt;Pride and Prejudice&lt;/i&gt;?&quot; His tone said only a cretin wouldn't know this.

&quot;Oh right, &lt;i&gt;P and P&lt;/i&gt;,&quot; J.D. said. &quot;You know, Tyler, you might want to pick up your balls--I think they just fell right off when you said that." -- Julie James]]>

Twelve hands flew straight into the air.
And unbelievably, Payton laughed." -- Julie James]]>
