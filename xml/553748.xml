	    <![CDATA["The big difference between my mom and me-- besides the fact that she is dead normal and I'm a magic-handling freak-- is that she's the real thing. She may have a slight problem seeing other people's points of view, but she's &lt;i&gt;honest&lt;/i&gt; about it. She's a brass-bound bitch because she believes she knows best. I'm a brass-bound bitch because I don't want anyone getting close enough to find out what a whiny little knot of naked nerve endings I really am. " -- Robin McKinley]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["This is the most important thing I will ever say to you.  The human mind is the ultimate testing device.  You can take all the notes you want on the technical data, anything you forget you can look up again, but this must be engraved on your hearts in letters of fire. There is nothing, nothing, nothing, more important to me in the men and women I train than their absolute personal integrity.  Whether you function as welders or inspectors, the laws of physics are implacable lie detectors.  You may fool men.  You will never fool metal.  That’s all." -- Lois McMaster Bujold]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Even if a tamed wolf makes a good sheepdog, he will never understand how the sheep feel....You are most fortunate.  For having been, as you thought, a coward, and helpless to fight - you know what that is like.  You know what bitterness that feeling breeds - you know in your own heart what kind of evil it brings.  And so you are most fit to fight it where it occurs." -- Elizabeth Moon]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I’ve no surety that it is. I know only parts of what I feel; I may be misnaming the whole. You dwell in my mind like a household spirit. All that I think is followed with, ‘I shall tell that thought to Eddi.’ Whatever I see or hear is colored by what I imagine you will say of it. What is amusing is twice so, if you have laughed at it. There is a way you have of turning your head, quickly with a little tilt, that seems more wonderful to me than the practiced movements of dancers. All this, taken together, I’ve come to think of as love, but it may not be.

It is not a comfortable feeling. But I find that, even so, I would wish the same feeling on you. The possibility that I suffer it alone–that frightens me more than all the host of the Unseelie Court." -- Emma Bull]]>

Simply dreadful." -- Ilona Andrews]]>
