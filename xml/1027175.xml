	    <![CDATA["Perfection is something we should all strive for.  It's a duty and a joy to perfect one's nature... The most difficult thing is love.  A loveless, driving person that just competes in the rat race is far from perfection in my book." -- R.D. Laing]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The expansionary dynamic of Western culture has been the root, the denominating constant, of modern history.  The grandeur of Western liberalism, its material abundance, the flourishing of its arts and sciences, its painful construction of constitutional democracy -- these interconnected achievements have been financed by the sustained theft called imperialism." -- Carl Oglesby]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["And I imagine... with great pleasure... all the horrible stirrings of the nonmanifested to bring forth the scream which creates the universe.  Maybe one day I'll see you trembling, and you'll go into convulsion and grow larger and smaller until your mouth opens and the world will come from your mouth, escaping through the window like a river, and it will flood the city.  And then we'll begin to live. " -- Alexandro Jodorowsky]]>

	    <![CDATA["The rational approach start from the idea that everything is explainable and that mystery is in some sense the enemy. This means that it prefers pejorative, and even wrong, answers to admitting its own lack of understanding." -- Jeremy Narby]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Give up defining yourself - to yourself or to others. You won't die. You will come to life. And don't be concerned with how others define you. When they define you, they are limiting themselves, so it's their problem. Whenever you interact with people, don't be there primarily as a function or a role, but as the field of conscious Presence. You can only lose something that you have, but you cannot lose something that you are." -- Eckhart Tolle]]>
