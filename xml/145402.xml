	    <![CDATA["Right before you head out running, it can be hard to remember exactly why you're doing it. You often have to override a nagging sense of futility, lacing up your shoes, telling yourslef that no matter how unlikely it seems right now, after you finish you will be glad you went. It's only afterward that it makes sense, although even then it's hard to rationalize why. You just feel right. After a run, you feel at one with the world, as though some unspecified, innate need has been fulfilled." -- Adharanand Finn]]>

	    <![CDATA["H. L. Mencken called it “the one authentic rectum of civilization,” but for most people Hollywood was a place of magic. In 1927, the iconic sign on the hillside above the city actually said HOLLYWOODLAND. It had been erected in 1923 to advertise a real estate development and had nothing to do with motion pictures. The letters, each over forty feet high, were in those days also traced out with electric lights. (The LAND was removed in 1949.)" -- Bill Bryson]]>

	    <![CDATA["Magazines were new. The Gentleman’s Magazine—the first periodical called a “magazine”—appeared in London in 1731. It offered “a Monthly Collection, to treasure up, as in a Magazine, the most remarkable Pieces.”3 The metaphor is to weapons. A magazine is, literally, an arsenal; a piece is a firearm." -- Jill Lepore]]>
