	    <![CDATA["All the books we own, both read and unread, are the fullest expression of self we have at our disposal. ... But with each passing year, and with each whimsical purchase, our libraries become more and more able to articulate who we are, whether we read the books or not." -- Nick Hornby]]>

	    <![CDATA["Andras Riedlmayer described a colleague who survived the siege of Sarajevo.  In the winter, the scholar and his wife ran out of firewood, and so began to burn their books for heat and cooking.  'This forces one to think critically,' Riedlmayer remembered his friend saying.  'One must prioritize.  First you burn old college textbooks, which you haven't read in thirty years.  Then there are the duplicates.  But eventually, you're forced to make tougher choices.  Who burns today: Dostoevsky or Proust?'  I asked Riedlmayer if his friend had any books left when the war was over.  'Oh yes,' he replied, his face lit by a flickering smile.  'He still had many books.  Sometimes, he told me, you look at the books and just choose to go hungry." -- Matthew Battles]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I always thought that being a librarian combined the skills of
bookseller, a psychologist, a social worker, and a used-car
salesman, with a strong dash of trapeze artist, politician, revival
preacher, and just a smidgen of can-can dancer." -- California Children´s Librarian Marian Drabkin]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["And on the subject of burning books: I want to congratulate librarians, not famous for their physical strength or their powerful political connections or their great wealth, who, all over this country, have staunchly resisted anti-democratic bullies who have tried to remove certain books from their shelves, and have refused to reveal to thought police the names of persons who have checked out those titles.

So the America I loved still exists, if not in the White House or the Supreme Court or the Senate or the House of Representatives or the media. The America I love still exists at the front desks of our public libraries." -- Kurt Vonnegut]]>
