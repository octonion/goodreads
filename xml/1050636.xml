The slogan Press On! has solved and always will solve the problems of the human race." -- Calvin Coolidge]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I want to see you.

Know your voice.

Recognize you when you
first come 'round the corner.

Sense your scent when I come 
into a room you've just left.

Know the lift of your heel,
the glide of your foot.

Become familiar with the way 
you purse your lips
then let them part, 
just the slightest bit,
when I lean in to your space
and kiss you.

I want to know the joy 
of how you whisper 
&quot;more" -- Mawlana Jalal-al-Din Rumi]]>
