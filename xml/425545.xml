	    <![CDATA["Here you go on this long long dream. Don't even try to wake up. Just let it go on until it is over. You will learn many things. Just relax and observe because there is pain and that's it mostly and you aren't going to be able to escape no matter what. Eventually it will all be over anyway. Good luck." -- Francesca Lia Block]]>

	    <![CDATA["I am looking for friends. What does that mean -- tame?&quot;

&quot;It is an act too often neglected,&quot; said the fox. &quot;It means to establish ties.&quot; 

&quot;To establish ties?&quot; 

&quot;Just that,&quot; said the fox. &quot;To me, you are still nothing more than a little boy who is just like a hundred thousand other little boys. And I have no need of you. And you, on your part, have no need of me. To you I am nothing more than a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes. But if you tame me, then we shall need each other. To me, you will be unique in all the world. To you, I shall be unique in all the world...." -- Antoine de Saint-Exupéry]]>

She has dreamed of that freedom, that power, and fears the wildness in herself that wants to live as beasts live, moved purely by need and desire. She has felt torn between the heat of her limbs and the thoughts in her mind telling her to be careful and good and always calm" -- Francesca Lia Block]]>
