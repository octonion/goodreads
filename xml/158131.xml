	    <![CDATA["It's a blessing Madame Gamache and I had at our wedding.  It was read at the end of the ceremony.

&lt;i&gt;Now you will feel no rain
For each of you will be shelter for the other
Now you will feel no cold
For each of you will be warmth for the other
Now there is no loneliness for you
Now there is no more loneliness.
Now you are two persons, but there is one life before you.
Go now to your dwelling place
To enter into the days of your togetherness.
And may your days be good and long upon this earth.&lt;/i&gt;

(Apache Blessing)" -- Louise Penny]]>

	    <![CDATA["Did I ever tell you the difference between a Northern fairy tale and a Southern one?&quot; she asked him, indulging herself and letting her head rest on his shoulder.  God, he felt good.  Her man.  Where her head was meant to lie, right there, on him. 
&quot;What's the difference?&quot;
&quot;A Northern one starts 'once upon a time,' while a Southern one starts 'y'all ain't going to believe this shit." -- Erin McCarthy]]>
