	    <![CDATA["The plot is deceptively simple. Condensed even fur- ther, it might read as a personal ad in some questfinder’s forum: Unlikely hero to save world from cataclysm. Seeks motley assortment of companions. Sidequests guaranteed." -- Michael P. Williams]]>

	    <![CDATA["Is Lavos a selfish conqueror of the world, or a planetary farmer simply following its instincts? How sentient is Lavos, and if it can speak to us, why won’t it? Do apiarists palaver with their bees, or do they just mind the hives and collect the honey? It’s painful to imagine our species as insects, as fodder for something bigger, more powerful. Something that could plummet from above and ruin us in the blink of an eye." -- Michael P. Williams]]>

	    <![CDATA["Frog speaks in a “Ye Olde Englishy” dialogue that is as charming as it is grammatically suspect. No one else in 600 AD talks like Frog. Not even Glenn, the boy Frog used to be." -- Michael P. Williams]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The Runaway Five's obvious influence is The Blues Brothers. During localization, their black and white suits were made more colorful to avoid legal action from Universal Pictures or the film's producers. When I told my wife Aviva about this, she admitted she had never seen The Blues Brothers film. Having grown up on a steady diet of Saturday Night Live-spawned movies, I told her that her innocence here was blasphemous. That night, we marveled together at James Brown's hair." -- Ken Baumann]]>

	    <![CDATA["I wrote this book to fill a blind spot in our history, to remind us that outsider amateur game-makers creating personal games have always been here. Since before your Xbox. Since before your PlayStation.

Lest we forget where we come from. Lest we forget what we're capable of." -- Anna Anthropy]]>
