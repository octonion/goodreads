		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Our hero's unreasoning rage was fed by a not unreasonable jealousy.  It was clear to him that Zuleika had forgotten his existence.  To-day, as soon as he had killed her love, she had shown him how much less to her was his love than the crowd's.  And now again it was only the crowd she cared for.  He followed with his eyes her long slender figure as she threaded her way in and out of the crowd, sinuously, confidingly, producing a penny from one lad's elbow, a threepenny-bit from between another's neck and collar, half a crown from another's hair, and always repeating in that flute-like voice of hers: &quot;Well, this is rather queer!" -- Max Beerbohm]]>

	    <![CDATA["Passion such as hers is all consent, asking little in return. I had merely to enter a room where she was to see her face take on that peaceful expression of one who is resting in bed. If I touched her, I had the impression that all the blood in her veins was turning to honey." -- Marguerite Yourcenar]]>

Archer received this strange communication in silence. His eyes remained unseeingly fixed on the thronged sunlit square below the window. At length he said in a low voice: &quot;She never asked me." -- Edith Wharton]]>
