	    <![CDATA["Aim high, but do not aim so high that you totally miss the target. What really matters is that he will love you, that he will respect you, that he will honor you, that he will be absolutely true to you, that he will give you the freedom of expression and let you fly in the development of your own talents. He is not going to be perfect, but if he is kind and thoughtful, if he knows how to work and earn a living, if he is honest and full of faith, the chances are you will not go wrong, that you will be immensely happy." -- Gordon B.

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Love is the very essence of life.  It is the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.  Yet it is not found only at the end of the rainbow.  Love is at the beginning also, and from it springs the beauty that arched across the sky on a stormy day.  Love is the security for which children weep, the yearning of youth, the adhesive that binds marriage, and the lubricant that prevents devastating friction in the home; it is the peace of old age, the sunlight of hope shining through death.  How rich are those who enjoy it in their associations with family, friends, and neighbors!  Love, like faith, is a gift of God.  It is also the most enduring and most powerful virtue." -- Gordon B. Hinckley]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The remedy for most marital stress is not in divorce.  It is in repentance and forgiveness, in sincere expressions of charity and service.  It is not in separation.  It is in simple integrity that leads a man and a woman to square up their shoulders and meet their obligations.  It is found in the Golden Rule, a time-honored principle that should first and foremost find expression in marriage." -- Gordon B. Hinckley]]>
