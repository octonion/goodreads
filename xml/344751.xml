		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I believe in the baby Jesus, and I believe he is handsome and lives in the sky with his pet cow.  I believe that it is essential the cow like you, and if you pet the cow with your mind, it will lick your hand and give you cash.  But if you make the cow angry, it will turn away from you, forget you exist, and your life will fall into shambles.  I believe that as long as the cow likes you, you can get what you want.  In order to keep the cow’s favor, you need to ‘let go and let God,’ meaning you can’t obsess about controlling every little thing.  You have to let things unfold naturally, and not try to change things you cannot change.  On the other hand, I believe that if you’ve made the cow happy by living this way, you’re allowed to ask for favors..." -- Augusten Burroughs]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["It turns out that (he) has a condition known as micropenis. This means his penis is less than three inches long, fully erect. It looks like a large clitoris, sticking out above two balls.
&quot;Suck my big, fat cock, &quot; he tells me. &quot;You like that big dick?&quot;
I am dizzy. I am literally dizzy. I was so shocked to encounter the micropenis and now am even more shocked to encounter the apparent lack of knowledge about the micropenis. I grip it in my hand, and it's lost, so I use my thumb and index finger to jerk it.
&quot;Yeah, &quot; he says. &quot;Yeah, man, stroke that long, hard cock. Work it.&quot;
I am now engaged in what I consider volunteer work. I am jerking him off purely out of pity. This is really no different from donating five percent of my paycheck to United Way every month, and it occurs to me that maybe now I don't need to give to the United Way and instead can keep the cash for myself for dating, which I am obviously going to have to do quite a bit more of." -- Augusten Burroughs]]>

&quot;You're so oral.  You'll never make it to genital!  The most you can ever hope for is to reach anal, you immature, frigid old maid,&quot; Natalie yelled.

&quot;Stop antagonizing me,&quot; Hope shouted.  &quot;Just stop transfering all this anger onto me.&quot;

&quot;Your avoidance tactics are not giong to work, Miss Hope,&quot; Natalie warned.  &quot;I'm not going to let you just slink away from me.  You hate me and you have to confront me." -- Augusten Burroughs]]>

And I'm standing on the edge of some crazy cliff.  What I have to do, I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff - I mean if they're running and they don't look where they're going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them.  That's all I do all day.  I'd just be the catcher in the rye and all.  I know it's crazy, but that's the only thing I'd really like to be." -- J. D. Salinger]]>
