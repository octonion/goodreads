		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, 'Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous?' Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It's not just in some of us; it's in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others." -- Marianne Williamson]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["For every nine people who denounce innovation only one will encourage it...For every nine people who do things the way they have always been done, only one will ever wonder if there is a better way.  For every nine people who stand in line in front of a locked building, only one will ever come around and check the back door.  Our progress as a species rests squarely on the shoulders of that tenth person.  The nine are satisfied with things they are told valuable.  Person 10 determines from himself what has value." -- Za Rinpoche]]>
