	    <![CDATA["By my love for you. I realized I loved you more than life itself, and I would rather give myself into your power than live without you. Nothing the magic could do to me could be worse than living without you. I was willing to give it all over to you. I offered the power everything I have. All of my love for you. Once I realized how much I loved you, I was willing to be yours on any terms. I understood that there could be nothing for the magic to harm. I’m already devoted to you; it didn’t need to change me. I was protected, because I have already been untouched by your love. I had utter faith that you felt the same, and had no fear of what would happen. Had I had any doubt, the magic would have latched on to that crack and taken me, but I had no doubt. My love for you is smooth and seamless. My love for you protected me from the magic." -- Terry Goodkind]]>

	    <![CDATA["Teasingly she took the apple from his mouth. Juice ran down his chin. Slowly, deliberately, she leaned over and licked the sweet juice from his chin.
I will have to admit though, that I will never look at an apple in quite the same way." -- Terry Goodkind]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I love you,&quot; she whispered.
Richard pulled her tight against him. His fingers traced a trail down the bumps of her spine.
&quot;I feel so frustrated that there aren't any better words than &quot;I love you,&quot;&quot; he said. &quot;It doesn't seem enough for the way I feel about you. I'm sorry there aren't any better words to tell you.&quot;
&quot;They are words enough for me.&quot;
&quot;Then, I love you, Kahlan. A thousand times, a million times, I love you. Forever." -- Terry Goodkind]]>
