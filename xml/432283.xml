But he’d paid me a compliment.) &quot;Too bad you can’t remember it,&quot; I concluded with a modest smile.
Eric looked like I’d hit him in the forehead with a mallet. For all of thirty seconds his reaction was completely gratifying." -- Charlaine Harris]]>

	    <![CDATA["Glass shattered, vampires roared, humans screamed. The noise battered at me, just as the tidal wave of scores of brains at high gear washed over me. When it began to taper off, I looked up into Eric's eyes. Incredibly, he was excited. He smiled at me. &quot;I knew I'd get on top of you somehow,&quot; he said.
Are you trying to make me mad so I'll forget how scared I am?&quot;
No, I'm just opportunistic.&quot;
I wiggled, trying to get out from under him, and he said, &quot;Oh, do that again. It felt great." -- Charlaine Harris]]>

	    <![CDATA["Let go,&quot; he advised me, and I loosened my grip on his hands. &quot;No, not of me,&quot; he said, smiling. &quot;You can hold on to me as long as you want. Let go of the pain, Sookie. Let go. You need to drift away.&quot;
It was the first time I had relinquished my will to someone else. As I looked at him, it became easy, and I retreated from the suffering and uncertainty of this strange place." -- Charlaine Harris]]>
