	    <![CDATA["I've owned a thousand houses that I've never built,&quot; she said.  &quot;Never had the money to build.  Couldn't have used if I had had the money.  Never really wanted to build maybe.  But I still own the houses.&quot;--Karen Holmes in From Here To Eternity" -- James Jones]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["It's difficult to explain, but I just somehow feel that I never really *have* lived; that I never really will live--exist or whatever--in the sense that other people do.  It drives me crazy.  I was terribly aware of it all those nights waiting for you in the Ritz bar looking around at what seemed to be real grown-up lives.  I just find everybody else's life surrounded by plate glass.  I mean I'd like to break through it just once and actually touch one." -- Elaine Dundy]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Mr. Casaubon had never had a strong bodily frame, and his soul was sensitive without being enthusiastic: it was too languid to thrill out of self-consciousness into passionate delight; it went on fluttering in the swampy ground where it was hatched, thinking of its wings and never flying." -- George Eliot]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Don't you know that love isn't just going to bed? Love isn't an act, it's a whole life. It's staying with her now because she needs you; it's knowing you and she will still care about each other when sex and daydreams, fights and futures -- when all that's on the shelf and done with. Love -- why, I'll tell you what love is: it's you at seventy-five and her at seventy-one, each of you listening for the other's step in the next room, each afraid that a sudden silence, a sudden cry, could mean a lifetime's talk is over." -- Brian Moore]]>
