	    <![CDATA["Can knowledge be conveyed that isn't felt?
But if transport's the problem -
they tell me get a job and earn yourself
an automobile-I'd rather collect my parts
as I go: chair, desk, house
and crankshaft Shakespeare.
Generator boy, Paul, love is carried
if it's held." -- Lorine Niedecker]]>

	    <![CDATA["Where did the men get the gold
So extraordinarily
Leaving little of me left
And from what men
(The men that burn in my heart)
I should escape. I am ashamed.
If the men turn towards me
Where are the rights of my solitude?" -- Lisa Robertson]]>

	    <![CDATA["It is always easy to mock 'distress,' but we are its contemporaries; we are at the endpoint of what Nous, ratio, &amp; Logos, still today the framework for what we are, cannot have failed to show: that murder is the first thing to count on, and elimination the surest means of identification. Today, everywhere, against this black but 'enlightened' background, remaining reality is disappearing in the mire of a 'globalized' world. Nothing, not even the most obvious phenomena, not even the purest, most wrenching love, can escape this era's shadow: a cancer of the subject, whether in the ego or in the masses..." -- Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe]]>
