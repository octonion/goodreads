	    <![CDATA["She said, 'Believe it or not, I used to be idealistic.'  I asked her what 'idealistic' meant.  'It means you live by what you think is right.'  'You don't do that anymore?'  'There are questions I don't ask anymore." -- Jonathan Safran Foer]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["You can see the most beautiful things from the observation deck of the Empire State Building. I read somewhere that people on the street are supposed to look like ants, but that's not true. They look like little people. And the cars look like little cars. And even the buildings look little. It's like New York is a miniature replica of New York, which is nice, because you can see what it's really like, instead of how it feels when you're in the middle of it." -- Jonathan Safran Foer]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The burden borne by mankind is a heavy and a crushing thing.  The word Jesus used means a load carried or toil borne to the point of exhaustion.  Rest is simply release from that burden.  It is not something we do, it is what comes to us when we cease to do. His own meekness, that is the rest." -- A.W. Tozer]]>
