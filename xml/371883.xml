		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The best remedy for those who are afraid, lonely or unhappy is to go outside, somewhere where they can be quite alone with the heavens, nature and God.  Because only then does one feel  that all is as it should be and that God wishes to see people happy, amidst the simple beauty of nature.  As longs as this exists, and it certainly always will, I know that then there will always be comfort for every sorrow, whatever the circumstances may be.  And I firmly believe that nature brings solace in all troubles." -- Anne Frank]]>
