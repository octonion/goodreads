		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Nobody reads poetry, we are told at every inopportune moment.  I read poetry.  I am somebody.  I am the people, too.  It can be allowed that an industrious quantity of contemporary American poetry is consciously written for a hermetic constituency; the bulk is written for the bourgeoisie, leaving a lean cut for labor.  Only the hermetically aimed has a snowball's chance in hell of reaching its intended ears.  One proceeds from this realization.  A staggering figure of vibrant, intelligent people can and do live without poetry, especially without the poetry of their time.  This figure includes the unemployed, the rank and file, the union brass, banker, scientist, lawyer, doctor, architect, pilot, and priest.  It also includes most academics, most of the faculty of the humanities, most allegedly literary editors and most allegedly literary critics.  They do so--go forward in their lives, toward their great reward, in an engulfing absence of poetry--without being perceived or perceiving themselves as hobbled or deficient in any significant way.  It is nearly true, though I am often reminded of a Transtromer broadside I saw in a crummy office building in San Francisco:

 

We got dressed and showed the house

You live well the visitor said

The slum must be inside you.

 

If I wanted to understand a culture, my own for instance, and if I thought such an understanding were the basis for a lifelong inquiry, I would turn to poetry first.  For it is my confirmed bias that the poets remain the most 'stunned by existence,' the most determined to redeem the world in words.." -- C.D. Wright]]>

	    <![CDATA["Batter my heart, three-person'd God ; for you
As yet but knock ; breathe, shine, and seek to mend ;
That I may rise, and stand, o'erthrow me, and bend
Your force, to break, blow, burn, and make me new.
I, like an usurp'd town, to another due,
Labour to admit you, but O, to no end.
Reason, your viceroy in me, me should defend,
But is captived, and proves weak or untrue.
Yet dearly I love you, and would be loved fain,
But am betroth'd unto your enemy ;
Divorce me, untie, or break that knot again,
Take me to you, imprison me, for I,
Except you enthrall me, never shall be free,
Nor ever chaste, except you ravish me." -- John Donne]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Once the process of falsification is set in motion, it won't stop. We're in a country where everything that can be falsified has been falsified: paintings in museums, gold ingots, bus tickets. The counterrevolution and the revolution fight with salvos of falsification: the result is that nobody can be sure what is true and what is false, the political police simulate revolutionary actions and the revolutionaries disguise themselves as policemen.&quot;

And who gains by it, in the end?&quot;

It's too soon to say. We have to see who can best exploit the falsifications, their own and those of the others: whether it's the police or our organization.&quot;

The taxi driver is pricking up his ears. You motion Corinna to restrain herself from making unwise remarks.

But she says, &quot;Don't be afraid. This is a fake taxi. What really alarms me, though, is that there is another taxi following us.&quot;

Fake or real?&quot;

Fake, certainly, but I don't know whether it belongs to the police or to us." -- Italo Calvino]]>

	    <![CDATA["Be patient toward all that is unsolved in your heart and try to love the questions themselves, like locked rooms and like books that are now written in a very foreign tongue. Do not now seek the answers, which cannot be given you because you would not be able to live them. And the point is, to live everything. Live the questions now. Perhaps you will then gradually, without noticing it, live along some distant day into the answer." -- Rainer Maria Rilke]]>
