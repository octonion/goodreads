	    <![CDATA["Mad Girl's Love Song

I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead;
I lift my lids and all is born again.
(I think I made you up inside my head.)

The stars go waltzing out in blue and red,
And arbitrary blackness gallops in:
I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead.

I dreamed that you bewitched me into bed
And sung me moon-struck, kissed me quite insane.
(I think I made you up inside my head.)

God topples from the sky, hell's fires fade:
Exit seraphim and Satan's men:
I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead.

I fancied you'd return the way you said,
But I grow old and I forget your name.
(I think I made you up inside my head.)

I should have loved a thunderbird instead;
At least when spring comes they roar back again.
I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead.
(I think I made you up inside my head.)" -- Sylvia Plath]]>

	    <![CDATA["When You Are Old&quot;


WHEN you are old and grey and full of sleep, 
And nodding by the fire, take down this book, 
And slowly read, and dream of the soft look 
Your eyes had once, and of their shadows deep; 
  
How many loved your moments of glad grace, 
And loved your beauty with love false or true, 
But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you, 
And loved the sorrows of your changing face; 
  
And bending down beside the glowing bars, 
Murmur, a little sadly, how Love fled 
And paced upon the mountains overhead 
And hid his face amid a crowd of stars." -- W.B. Yeats]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["If you want to write, if you want to create, you must be the most sublime fool that God ever turned out and sent rambling. You must write every single day of your life. You must read dreadful dumb books and glorious books, and let them wrestle in beautiful fights inside your head, vulgar one moment, brilliant the next. You must lurk in libraries and climb the stacks like ladders to sniff books like perfumes and wear books like hats upon your crazy heads. I wish you a wrestling match with your Creative Muse that will last a lifetime. I wish craziness and foolishness and madness upon you. May you live with hysteria, and out of it make fine stories — science fiction or otherwise. Which finally means, may you be in love every day for the next 20,000 days. And out of that love, remake a world." -- Ray Bradbury]]>

	    <![CDATA["Comedy is hard.  In many ways, it's like singing: If you have perfect pitch, it's much easier.  But you can still go a long way toward mastering the rudiments if you must trust your voice.  Most of the mistakes I've seen people make in trying to write funny is that they don't trust their own senses of humor.  They don't think they're funny, and they set out to write funny the way they've read other people being funny with a grim determination that pretty much precludes any chance that anybody is going to have fun.  Relax, listen to your characters, exploit their fears and flaws, and mine their situations for places in which they can use their own brands of humor." -- Jennifer Crusie]]>

	    <![CDATA["&lt;i&gt;What's going on with you?&lt;/i&gt; Jared asked out of the blue.
&lt;i&gt;Beginning a new era of journalistic history,&lt;/i&gt; Kami told him, sending her cheer through their connection.  &lt;i&gt;Also, to be perfectly honest, Angela and I were slapping our asses.&lt;/i&gt;

	    <![CDATA["I can't be any more addicted to it than I already am,&quot;Jamie said slowly, as though he'd rehearsed this, and then waiting for a cue Nick obviously had no intention of giving.&quot; Think about crack!&quot; Jamie added, clearly struck by insperation. &quot;Yes! It's like I'm a crack addict, and you're my friend the drug dealer who gives me crack for free, and I know you're just trying to be a good friend, but every time I think 'Wow, this crack might be a little bit of a problem for me,' you're there to say, 'Have some more delicious crack.'
