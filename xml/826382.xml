	    <![CDATA["Life is like a box of crayons.  Most people are the 8 color boxes, but what you're really looking for are the 64 color boxes with the sharpeners on the back.  I fancy myself to be a 64 color box, though I've got a few missing.  It's okay though, because I've got some more vibrant colors like periwinkle at my disposal.  I have a bit of a problem though in that I can only meet the 8 color boxes.  Does anyone else have that problem?  I mean there are so many different colors of life, of feeling, of articulation.  So when I meet someone who's an 8 color type...I'm like, hey girl, Magenta! and she's like, oh, you mean purple! and she goes off on her purple thing, and I'm like, no I want Magenta!" -- John Mayer]]>
