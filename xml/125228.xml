	    <![CDATA["At that moment, in the sunset on Watership Down, there was offered to General Woundwort the opportunity to show whether he was really the leader of vision and genius which he believed himself to be, or whether he was no more than a tyrant with the courage and cunning of a pirate.  For one beat of his pulse the lame rabbit's idea shone clearly before him.  He grasped it and realized what it meant.  The next, he had pushed it away from him." -- Richard Adams]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["In Europe life retreats out of the cold, and exquisite fireside myths have resulted—Balder, Persephone—but [in India] the retreat is from the source of life, the treacherous sun, and no poetry adorns it because disillusionment cannot be beautiful. Men yearn for poetry though they may not confess it; they desire that joy shall be graceful and sorrow august and infinity have a form, and India fails to accommodate them." -- E. M. Forster]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Have you ever found your heart's desire and then lost it?  I had seen myself, a portrait of myself as a reader.  My childhood: days home sick from school reading Nancy Drew, forbidden books read secretively late at night.  Teenage years reading -trying to read- books I'd heard were important, Naked Lunch, and The Fountainhead, Ulysses and Women in Love... It was as though I had dreamt the perfect lover, who vanished as I woke, leaving me pining and surly." -- Audrey Niffenegger]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The master in the art of living makes little distinction between his work and his play, his labor and his leisure, his mind and his body, his information and his recreation, his love and his religion. He hardly knows which is which. He simply pursues his vision of excellence at whatever he does, leaving others to decide whether he is working or playing. To him he's always doing both.  " -- James A. Michener]]>
