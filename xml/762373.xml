		<description>
	    <![CDATA["One of the greatest myths in the world - &amp; the phrase 'greatest myths' is just a fancy way of saying 'big fat lies' -- is that troublesome things get less &amp; less troublesome if you do them more &amp; more. People say this myth when they are teaching children to ride bicycles, for instance, as though falling off a bicycle &amp; skinning your knee is less troublesome the fourteenth time you do it than it is the first time. The truth is that troublesome things tend to remain troublesome no matter how many times you do them, &amp; that you should avoid doing them unless they are absolutely urgent." -- Lemony Snicket]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["No long-term marriage is made easily, and there have been times when I've been so angry or so hurt that I thought my love would never recover. And then, in the midst of near despair, something has happened beneath the surface. A bright little flashing fish of hope has flicked silver fins and the water is bright and suddenly I am returned to a state of love again — till next time. I've learned that there will always be a next time, and that I will submerge in darkness and misery, but that I won't stay submerged. And each time something has been learned under the waters; something has been gained; and a new kind of love has grown. The best I can ask for is that this love, which has been built on countless failures, will continue to grow. I can say no more than that this is mystery, and gift, and that somehow or other, through grace, our failures can be redeemed and blessed." -- Madeleine L'Engle]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The written word, obviously, is very inward, and when we're reading, we're thinking. It's a sort of spiritual, meditative activity. When we're looking at visual objects, I think our eyes are obviously directed outward, so there's not as much reflective time. And it's the reflectiveness and the spiritual inwardness about reading that appeals to me." -- Joyce Carol Oates]]>
