	    <![CDATA["His heart beat faster and faster as Daisy’s white face came up to his own.  He knew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his unutterable visions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp again like the mind of God.  So he waited, listening for a moment longer to the tuning fork that had been struck upon a star.  Then he kissed her. At his lips’ touch she blossomed like a flower and the incarnation was complete." -- F. Scott Fitzgerald]]>
