	    <![CDATA["Atticus sat looking at the floor for a long time.  Finally he raised his head.  “Scout,” he said, “Mr. Ewell fell on his knife.  Can you possibly understand?”

Atticus looked like he needed cheering up.  I ran to him and hugged him and kissed him with all my might.  “Yes sir, I understand,” I reassured him.  “Mr. Tate was right.”

Atticus disengaged himself and looked at me.  “What do you mean?”

“Well, it’d be sort of like shootin’ a mockingbird, wouldn’t it?”

Atticus put his face in my hair and rubbed it.  When he got up and walked across the porch into the shadows, his youthful step had returned.  Before he went inside the house, he stopped in front of Boo Radley.  “Thank you for my children, Arthur.” he said." -- Harper Lee]]>

	    <![CDATA["The remainder of my schooldays were no more auspicious than the first.  Indeed, they were an endless Project that slowly evolved into a Unit, in which miles of construction paper and wax crayon were expended by the State of Alabama in its well-meaning but fruitless efforts to teach me Group Dynamics." -- Harper Lee]]>
