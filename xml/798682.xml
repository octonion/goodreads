	    <![CDATA["I DON'T CARE!&quot; Harry yelled at them, snatching up a lunascope and throwing it into the fireplace. &quot;I'VE HAD ENOUGH, I'VE SEEN ENOUGH, I WANT OUT, I WANT IT TO END, I DON'T CARE ANYMORE!&quot;
&quot;You do care,&quot; said Dumbledore. He had not flinched or made a single move to stop Harry demolishing his office. His expression was calm, almost detached. &quot;You care so much you feel as though you will bleed to death with the pain of it." -- J.K. Rowling]]>

&quot;I'm not as good as you,&quot; said Harry, very embarrassed, as she let go of him.
