	    <![CDATA["So this is it,&quot; said Arthur, &quot;We are going to die.&quot;
&quot;Yes,&quot; said Ford, &quot;except... no! Wait a minute!&quot; He suddenly lunged across the chamber at something behind Arthur's line of vision. &quot;What's this switch?&quot; he cried.
&quot;What? Where?&quot; cried Arthur, twisting round.
&quot;No, I was only fooling,&quot; said Ford, &quot;we are going to die after all." -- Douglas Adams]]>

	    <![CDATA["Miss Prism: Do not speak slightingly of the three-volume novel, Cecily. I wrote one myself in earlier days. 

Cecily: Did you really, Miss Prism? How wonderfully clever you are! I hope it did not end happily? I don't like novels that end happily. They depress me so much. 

Miss Prism: The good ended happily, and the bad unhappily. That is what fiction means." -- Oscar Wilde]]>
