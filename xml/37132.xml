	    <![CDATA["His hand rested on my hair, and without knowing quite how it happened, I found myself curled against him, my head just fitting in the hollow of his shoulder.

For so many years,&quot; he said, &quot;for so long, I have been so many things, so many different men.&quot;  I felt him swallow, and he shifted slightly, the linen of his nightshirt rustling with starch.

I was Uncle to Jenny's children, and Brother to her and Ian. 'Milord' to Fergus, and 'Sir' to my tenants.  'Mac Dubh' to the men of Ardsmuir and 'MacKenzie' to the other servants at Helwater. 'Malcolm the printer,' then, and 'Jamie Roy' at the docks.&quot;  The hand stroked my hair, slowly, with a whispering sound like the wind outside.  &quot;But here,&quot; he said, so softly I could barely hear him, &quot;here in the dark, with you...I have no name." -- Diana Gabaldon]]>
