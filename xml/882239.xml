		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Unlike Rosa, I can see no divine purpose behind the tangle of this existence, no ordering hand.  It is all a mystery, or more accurately, a mess.  There are no heroes or villains, no saviors or demons or angels.  Only those who have died and those of us who, for whatever reason, have survived.  None of this will keep me from believing in God.  I believe in Him, I just don't know that I will ever have faith in Him." -- Brady Udall]]>

	    <![CDATA["There was one difference I would come to realize, between white kids and Indians. Among white kids there are tattletales everywhere. Indians? An Indian wouldn't tattle to save his own mother. Indians, over the years, have learned the value of keeping their mouths shut." -- Brady Udall]]>

	    <![CDATA["Gratitude is a mark of a noble soul and a refined character. We like to be around those who are grateful. They tend to brighten all around them. They make others feel better about themselves. They tend to be more humble, more joyful, more likable." -- Joseph B. Wirthlin]]>

	    <![CDATA["My plea is that we stop seeking out the storms and enjoy more fully the sunlight...I am asking that we look a little deeper for the good, that we still our voices of insult and sarcasm, that we more generously compliment and endorse virtue and effort." -- Gordon B. Hinckley]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["For most affairs, this eventually becomes the most fundamental of questions, the only one that matters: Do we love each other more than the lives we already have? It is the question that hovers in the background of every secret phone call, flavors every tryst with the head of possibilities of apocalypse and renewal; and it is the answer to that question, or the lack thereof, that so often dooms an affair to failure." -- Brady Udall]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Because this, after all, was the basic truth they all chose to live by: that love was no finite commodity. That it was not subject to the cruel reckoning of addition and subtraction, that to give to one did not necessarily mean to take from another; that the heart, in its infinite capacity-even the confused and cheating heart of the man in front of her, even the paltry thing now clenched and faltering inside her own chest-could open itself to all who would enter, like a house with windows and doors thrown wide, like the heart of God itself, vast and accommodating and holy, a mansion of rooms without number, full of multitudes without end." -- Brady Udall]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["But Golden's dark form in the doorway had imprinted something new and painful on the hard plates of her chest: that old devil, hope. The kind of hope that abandons you in your worst moments and is suddenly there again, weeks later, trailing you like the stubborn, slinking dog who will not take no for an answer.  The kind of greedy hope that tricks you into believing that at least some of the things taken from you might be restored, that after everything, you might find your way back to something like happiness." -- Brady Udall]]>
