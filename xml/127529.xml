	    <![CDATA["I can finally see that all the terrible parts of my life, the embarrassing parts, the incidents I wanted to pretend never happened, and the things that make me &quot;weird&quot; and &quot;different,&quot; were actually the most important parts of my life.  They were the parts that made me ME." -- Jenny Lawson]]>

	    <![CDATA["Because you are defined not by life's imperfect moments, but by your reaction to them.  And because there is joy in embracing - rather than running from - the utter absurdity of life." -- Jenny Lawson]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["There are so many ways to be brave in this world. Sometimes bravery involves laying down your life for something bigger than yourself, or for someone else. Sometimes it involves giving up everything you have ever known, or everyone you have ever loved, for the sake of something greater.

But sometimes it doesn't.

Sometimes it is nothing more than gritting your teeth through pain, and the work of every day, the slow walk toward a better life. 

That is the sort of bravery I must have now." -- Veronica Roth]]>
