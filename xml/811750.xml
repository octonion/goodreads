	    <![CDATA["New mothers enter the world of parenting feeling much like Alice in Wonderland.
-	Being a mother is one of the most rewarding jobs on earth and also one of the most challenging.
-	Motherhood is a process. Learn to love the process.
-	There is a tremendous amount of learning that takes place in the first year of your baby’s life; the baby learns a lot, too.
-	It is sometimes difficult to reconcile the fantasy of what you thuoght motherhood would be like, and what you thought you would be like as a mother, with reality.
-	Take care of yourself. If Mommy isn’t happy, no one else in the family is happy either.
-	New mother generally need to lower their expectations.
-	A good mother learns to love her child as he is and adjusts her mothering to suit her child." -- Debra Gilbert Rosenberg]]>
