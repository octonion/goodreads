	    <![CDATA["Be patient toward all that is unsolved in your heart and try to love the questions themselves, like locked rooms and like books that are now written in a very foreign tongue. Do not now seek the answers, which cannot be given you because you would not be able to live them. And the point is, to live everything. Live the questions now. Perhaps you will then gradually, without noticing it, live along some distant day into the answer." -- Rainer Maria Rilke]]>

	    <![CDATA["Nothing is more practical than finding God, 
That is, than falling in a love in a quite absolute, final way. 
What you are in love with, what seizes your imagination will affect everything. 
It will decide what will get you out of bed in the mornings, 
What you will do with your evenings, 
How you spend your weekends, 
What you read, 
Who you know, 
What breaks your heart, 
And what amazes you with joy and gratitude. 
Fall in love, stay in love, and it will decide everything." -- Pedro Arrupe]]>
