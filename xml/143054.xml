	    <![CDATA["You should never read just for &quot;enjoyment.&quot; Read to make yourself smarter! Less judgmental. More apt to understand your friends' insane behavior, or better yet, your own. Pick &quot;hard books.&quot; Ones you have to concentrate on while reading. And for god's sake, don't let me ever hear you say, &quot;I can't read fiction. I only have time for the truth.&quot; Fiction is the truth, fool! Ever hear of &quot;literature&quot;? That means fiction, too, stupid." -- John Waters]]>
