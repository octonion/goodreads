		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The Ephebians believed that every man should have the vote (provided that he wasn't poor, foreign, nor disqualified by reason of being mad, frivolous, or a woman). Every five years someone was elected to be Tyrant, provided he could prove that he was honest, intelligent, sensible, and trustworthy. Immediately after he was elected, of course, it was obvious to everyone that he was a criminal madman and totally out of touch with the view of the ordinary philosopher in the street looking for a towel. And then five years later they elected another one just like him, and really it was amazing how intelligent people kept on making the same mistakes." -- Terry Pratchett]]>

	    <![CDATA["But is all this true?&quot; said Brutha.
Didactylos shrugged. &quot;Could be. Could be. We are here and it is now. The way I see it is, after that, everything tends towards guesswork.&quot;
&quot;You mean you don't KNOW it's true?&quot; said Brutha.
&quot;I THINK it might be,&quot; said Didactylos. &quot;I could be wrong. Not being certain is what being a philosopher is all about." -- Terry Pratchett]]>
