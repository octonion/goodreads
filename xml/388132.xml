		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Books, by their very nature and variety, help us grow in empathy for others, in tolerance and awareness.  But they should increase our skepticism as well as our humanity, for all good readers know how easy it is to misread.  What counts is to stay receptive and open, to reserve judgment and try to foresee consequences, to avoid the facile conclusion and be ready to change one's mind." -- Michael Dirda]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Though much is taken, much abides; and though
We are not now that strength which in old days
Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are;
One equal temper of heroic hearts,
Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will
To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield." -- Alfred Lord Tennyson]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Soon the childâ€™s clear eye is clouded over by ideas and opinions, preconceptions, and abstractions. Simple free being becomes encrusted with the burdensome armor of the ego. Not until years later does an instinct come that a vital sense of mystery has been withdrawn. The sun glints through the pines and the heart is pierced in a moment of beauty and strange pain, like a memory of paradise. After that day, we become seekers." -- Peter Matthiessen]]>
