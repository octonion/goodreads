		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Be patient toward all that is unsolved in your heart and try to love the questions themselves, like locked rooms and like books that are now written in a very foreign tongue. Do not now seek the answers, which cannot be given you because you would not be able to live them. And the point is, to live everything. Live the questions now. Perhaps you will then gradually, without noticing it, live along some distant day into the answer." -- Rainer Maria Rilke]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["If you could see how beautiful the forest is! I sometimes slip away there at days end after my work day and I always return overwhelmed. It has such a calm, such a terrible grandeur, to the point that I am surprised that I feel genuinely afraid. I don't know what the trees says amongst themselves, but they say something we don't speak the same language." -- Jean-François Millet]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["One generation after another falls like honeybees upon this memorable forest, rifle its sweets, pack themselves with vital memories, and when the theft is consummated depart again into life richer, but poorer also. The forest, indeed, they have possessed, from that day forward it is theirs dissolubly, and they will never return to walk in it at night in the fondest of their dreams, and use it forever in their books and pictures." -- Robert Louis Stevenson]]>

The roots on, let them
Dangle

And the dirt

Just to make clear
Where they come from." -- Charles Olson]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Isn't it strange how princes and kings,
and clowns that caper in sawdust rings,
and common people, like you and me,
are builders for eternity?

Each is given a list of rules;
a shapeless mass; a bag of tools.
And each must fashion, ere life is flown,
A stumbling block, or a Stepping-Stone." -- R.L.Sharpe]]>
