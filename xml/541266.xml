	    <![CDATA["What are you doing?&quot; 
&quot;Ya!&quot; said Jane, whirling around, her hands held up menacingly. 
It was Mr. Nobley with coat, hat, and cane, watching her with wide eyes. Jane took several quick (but oh so casual) steps away from Martin's window. 
&quot;Um, did I just say, 'Ya'?&quot; 
&quot;You just said 'Ya,'&quot; he confirmed. &quot;If I am not mistaken, it was a battle cry, warning that you were about to attack me.
I, uh...&quot; She stopped to laugh. &quot;I wasn't aware until this precise and awkward moment that when startled in a startled in a strange place, my instincts would have me pretend to be a ninja." -- Shannon Hale]]>

	    <![CDATA["Books can be possessive, can't they? You're walking around in a bookstore and a certain one will jump out at you, like it had moved there on its own, just to get your attention. Sometimes what's inside will change your life, but sometimes you don't even have to read it. Sometimes it's a comfort just to have a book around.  Many of these books haven't even had their spines cracked.  'Why do you buy books you don't even read?' our daughter asks us.  That's like asking someone who lives alone why they bought a cat.  For company, of course." -- Sarah Addison Allen]]>

	    <![CDATA["I'm Min's fairy godmother, Charm Boy,' Liza said, frowning down at him. 'And if you don't give her a happily ever after, I'm going to come back and beat you to death with a snow globe.'

What happened to &quot;bibbity bobbity boo&quot;?' Cal asked Min.

That was Disney, honey,' Min said. 'It wasn't a documentary." -- Jennifer Crusie]]>
