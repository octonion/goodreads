	    <![CDATA["May today there be peace within.   

May you trust God that you are exactly where you are meant to be.  
 
May you not forget the infinite possibilities that are born of faith.  
 
May you use those gifts that you have received, and pass on the love that has been given to you.   

May you be content knowing you are a child of God. 

 Let this presence settle into your bones, and allow your soul the freedom to sing, dance, praise and love.   

It is there for each and every one of us." -- Teresa of Ávila]]>
