	    <![CDATA["Everything ends, and Everything matters.  

Everything matters not in spite of the end of you and all that you love, but because of it.  Everything is all you’ve got…and after Everything is nothing.  So you were wise to welcome Everything, the good and the bad alike, and cling to it all.  Gather it in.  Seek the meaning in sorrow and don’t ever turn away, not once, from here until the end.  Because it is all the same, it is all unfathomable, and it is all infinitely preferable to the one dreadful alternative." -- Ron Currie Jr.]]>

	    <![CDATA["If you want to really hurt you parents, and you don't have the nerve to be gay, the least you can do is go into the arts. I'm not kidding. The arts are not a way to make a living. They are a very human way of making life more bearable. Practicing an art, no matter how well or badly, is a way to make your soul grow, for heaven's sake. Sing in the shower. Dance to the radio. Tell stories. Write a poem to a friend, even a lousy poem. Do it as well as you possible can. You will get an enormous reward. You will have created something." -- Kurt Vonnegut]]>

	    <![CDATA["&lt;i&gt;I will be very careful the next time I fall in love&lt;/i&gt;, she told herself. Also, she had made a promise to herself that she intended on keeping. She was never going to go out with another writer: no matter how charming, sensitive, inventive or fun they could be. They weren't worth it in the long run.  They were emotionally too expensive and the upkeep was complicated. They were like having a vacuum cleaner around the house that broke all the time and only Einstein could fix it. 
    She wanted her next lover to be a broom." -- Richard Brautigan]]>
