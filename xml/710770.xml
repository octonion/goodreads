	    <![CDATA["A great numb feeling washes over me as I let go of the past and look forward to the future. Pretend to be a vampire. I don't really need to pretend, because it's who I am, an emotional vampire. I've just come to expect it. Vampires are real. That I was born this way. That I feed off of other people's real emotions. Search for this night's prey. Who will it be?" -- Bret Easton Ellis]]>

	    <![CDATA["Got you. You're mine now. For the rest of the day, week, month, year, life. Have you guessed who I am? Sometimes I think you have. Sometimes when you're standing in a crowd I feel those sultry, dark eyes of yours stop on me. Are you too afraid to come up to me and let me know how you feel? I want to moan and writhe with you and I want to go up to you and kiss your mouth and pull you to me and say &quot;I love you I love you I love you&quot; while stripping. I want you so bad it stings. I want to kill the ugly girls that you're always with. Do you really like those boring, naive, coy, calculating girls or is it just for sex? The seeds of love have taken hold, and if we won't burn together, I'll burn alone." -- Bret Easton Ellis]]>

	    <![CDATA["I started inventing things, and then I couldn't stop, like beavers, which I know about. People think they cut down trees so they can build dams, but in reality it's because their teeth never stop growing, and if they didn't constantly file them down by cutting through all of those trees, their teeth would start to grow into their own faces, which would kill them. That's how my brain was." -- Jonathan Safran Foer]]>

	    <![CDATA["Clay, did you ever love me?&quot;
I'm studying a billboard and say that I didn't hear what she said.
&quot;I asked if you ever loved me?&quot;
On the terrace the sun bursts into my eyes and for one blinding moment I see myself clearly. I remember the first time we made love, in the house in Palm Springs, her body tan and wet, lying against cool, white sheets.
&quot;Don't do this, Blair,&quot; I tell her.
&quot;Just tell me.&quot;
I don't say anything.
&quot;Is it such a hard question to answer?&quot;
I look at her straight on.
&quot;Yes or no?&quot;
&quot;Why?&quot;
&quot;Damnit, Clay,&quot; she sighs.
&quot;Yeah, sure, I guess.&quot;
&quot;Don't lie to me.&quot;
&quot;What in the fuck do you want to hear?&quot;
&quot;Just tell me,&quot; she says, her voice rising.
&quot;No,&quot; I almost shout. &quot;I never did.&quot; I almost start to laugh.
She draws in a breath and says, &quot;Thank you. That's all I wanted to know.&quot; She sips her wine.
&quot;Did you ever love me?&quot; I ask her back, though by now I can't even care.
She pauses. &quot;I thought about it and yeah, I did once. I mean I really did. Everything was all right for a while. You were kind.&quot; She looks down and then goes on. &quot;But it was like you weren't there. Oh shit, this isn't going to make any sense.&quot; She stops.
I look at her, waiting for her to go on, looking up at the billboard. Disappear Here.
&quot;I don't know if any other person I've been with has been really there, either ... but at least they tried.&quot;
I finger the menu; put the cigarette out.
&quot;You never did. Other people made an effort and you just ... It was just beyond you.&quot; She takes another sip of her wine. &quot;You were never there. I felt sorry for you for a little while, but then I found it hard to. You're a beautiful boy, Clay, but that's about it.&quot;
I watch the cars pass by on Sunset.
&quot;It's hard to feel sorry for someone who doesn't care.&quot;
&quot;Yeah?&quot; I ask.
&quot;What do you care about? What makes you happy?&quot;
&quot;Nothing. Nothing makes me happy. I like nothing,&quot; I tell her.
&quot;Did you ever care about me, Clay?&quot;
I don't say anything, look back at the menu.
&quot;Did you ever care about me?&quot; she asks again.
&quot;I don't want to care. If I care about things, it'll just be worse, it'll just be another thing to worry about. It's less painful if I don't care.&quot;
&quot;I cared about you for a little while.&quot;
I don't say anything.
She takes off her sunglasses and finally says, &quot;I'll see you later, Clay.&quot; She gets up.
&quot;Where are you going?&quot; I suddenly don't want to leave Blair here. I almost want to take her back with me.
&quot;Have to meet someone for lunch.&quot;
&quot;But what about us?&quot;
&quot;What about us?&quot; She stands there for a moment, waiting. I keep staring at the billboard until it begins to blur and when my vision becomes clearer I watch as Blair's car glides out of the parking lot and becomes lost in the haze of traffic on Sunset. The waiter comes over and asks, &quot;Is everything okay, sir?&quot;
I look up and put my sunglasses on and try to smile. &quot;Yeah." -- Bret Easton Ellis]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["People are afraid to merge on freeways in Los Angeles. This is the first thing I hear when I come back to the city. Blair picks me up from LAX and mutters this under her breath as she drives up the onramp. She says, &quot;People are afraid to merge on freeways in Los Angeles.&quot; Though that sentence shouldn't bother me, it stays in my mind for an uncomfortably long time. Nothing else seems to matter. Not the fact that I'm eighteen and it's December and the ride on the plane had been rough and the couple from Santa Barbara, who were sitting across from me in first class, had gotten pretty drunk. Not the mud that had splattered on the legs of my jeans, which felt kind of cold and loose, earlier that day at an airport in  New Hampshire. Not the stain on the arm of the wrinkled, damp shirt I wear, a shirt which looked fresh and clean this morning. Not the tear on the neck of my gray argyle vest, which seems vaguely more eastern than before, especially next to Blair's clean tight jeans and her pale-blue shirt. All of this seems irrelevant next to that one sentence. It seems easier to hear that people are afraid to merge than &quot;I'm pretty sure Muriel is anorexic&quot; or the singer on the radio crying out about magnetic waves. Nothing else seems to matter to me but those ten words. Not the warm winds, which seem to propel the car down the empty asphalt freeway, or the faded smell of marijuana which still faintly permeates Blaire's car. All it comes down to is the fact that I'm a boy coming home for a month and meeting someone whom I haven't seen for four months and people are afraid to merge." -- Bret Easton Ellis]]>
