	    <![CDATA["I still remember the day I got my first calculator 

Teacher: All right, children, welcome to fourth grade math. Everyone take a calculator out of the bin. 
Me: What are these? 
Teacher: From now on we'll be using calculators. 
Me: What do these things do? 
Teacher: Simple operations, like multiplication and division. 
Me: You mean this device just...does them? By itself? 
Teacher: Yes. You enter in the problem and press equal. 
Me: You...you knew about this machine all along, didn't you? This whole time, while we were going through this...this charade with the pencils and the line paper and the stupid multiplication tables!...I'm sorry for shouting...It's just...I'm a little blown away. 
Teacher: Okay, everyone, today we're going to go over some word problems. 
Me: What the hell else do you have back there? A magical pen that writes book reports by itself? Some kind of automatic social studies worksheet that...that fills itself out? What the hell is going on? 
Teacher: If a farmer farms five acres of land a day-- 
Me: So that's it, then. The past three years have been a total farce. All this time I've been thinking, &quot;Well, this is pretty hard and frustrating but I guess these are useful skills to have.&quot; Meanwhile, there was a whole bin of these things in your desk. We could have jumped straight to graphing. Unless, of course, there's some kind of graphing calculator! 
Teacher: There is. You get one in ninth grade. 
Me: Is this...Am I on TV? Is this a prank show? 
Teacher: No.

	    <![CDATA["It is better to be alone, she figures, than to be with someone who can't see who you are.  It is better to lead than to follow.  It is better to speak up than stay silent.  It is better to open doors than to shut them on people.

She will not be simple and sweet.  She will not be what people tell her to be.  That Bunny Rabbit is dead." -- E. Lockhart]]>

	    <![CDATA["I do not mourn the loss of my sister because she will always be with me, in my heart,&quot; she says. &quot;I am, however, rather annoyed that my Tara has left me to suffer you lot alone. I do not see as well without her. I do not hear as well without her. I do not feel as well without her. I would be better off without a hand or a leg than without my sister. Then at least she would be here to mock my appearance and claim to be the pretty one for a change. We have all lost our Tara, but I have lost a part of myself as well." -- Erin Morgenstern]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["People think a soul mate is your perfect fit, and that's what everyone wants. But a true soul mate is a mirror, the person who shows you everything that is holding you back, the person who brings you to your own attention so you can change your life.  

A true soul mate is probably the most important person you'll ever meet, because they tear down your walls and smack you awake.  But to live with a soul mate forever?  Nah. Too painful.  Soul mates, they come into your life just to reveal another layer of yourself to you, and then leave.  

A soul mates purpose is to shake you up, tear apart your ego a little bit, show you your obstacles and addictions, break your heart open so new light can get in, make you so desperate and out of control that you have to transform your life, then introduce you to your spiritual master..." -- Elizabeth Gilbert]]>

	    <![CDATA["As the lightness buoys me, I wonder if maybe she was right.  Maybe it's not about looking hot for guys, but about feeling like a place acknowledged you, winked at you, accepted you.  It's strange because, of all the people in all the cities, I'd have thought that to Parisians I'd be invisible, but apparently I'm not.  Apparently in Paris, not only can I skate, but I practically qualify for the Olympics!" -- Gayle Forman]]>
