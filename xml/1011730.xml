	    <![CDATA["What was that?&quot; Belgarath asked, coming back around the corner.
&quot;Brill,&quot; Silk replied blandly, pulling his Murgo robe back on.
&quot;Again?&quot; Belgarath demanded with exasperation. &quot;What was he doing this time?&quot;
&quot;Trying to fly, last time I saw him.&quot; Silk smirked.
The old man looked puzzled.
&quot;He wasn't doing it very well,&quot; Silk added.
Belgarath shrugged. &quot;Maybe it'll come to him in time.&quot;
&quot;He doesn't really have all that much time.&quot; Silk glanced out over the edge.
&quot;From far below - terribly far below - there came a faint, muffled crash; then, after several seconds, another.  &quot;Does bouncing count?&quot; Silk asked.
Belgarath made a wry face. &quot;Not really.&quot;
&quot;Then I'd say he didn't learn in time.&quot; Silk said blithely." -- David Eddings]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["One word, Ma'am,&quot; he said, coming back from the fire; limping, because of the pain. &quot;One word. All you've been saying is quite right, I shouldn't wonder. I'm a chap who always liked to know the worst and then put the best face I can on it. So I won't deny any of what you said. But there's one more thing to be said, even so. Suppose we have only dreamed, or made up, all those things-trees and grass and sun and moon and stars and Aslan himself. Suppose we have. Then all I can say is that, in that case, the made-up things seem a good deal more important than the real ones. Suppose this black pit of a kingdom of yours is the only world. Well, it strikes me as a pretty poor one. And that's a funny thing, when you come to think of it. We're just babies making up a game, if you're right. But four babies playing a game can make a play-world which licks your real world hollow. That's why I'm going to stand by the play world. I'm on Aslan's side even if there isn't any Aslan to lead it. I'm going to live as like a Narnian as I can even if there isn't any Narnia. So, thanking you kindly for our supper, if these two gentlemen and the young lady are ready, we're leaving your court at once and setting out in the dark to spend our lives looking for Overland. Not that our lives will be very long, I should think; but that's a small loss if the world's as dull a place as you say." -- C.S. Lewis]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Libertarianism is good because it helps conservatives pass off a patently probusiness political agenda as a noble bid for human freedom.  Whatever we may think of libertarianism as a set of ideas, practically speaking, it is a doctrine that owes its visibility to the obvious charms it holds for the wealthy and the powerful.  The reason we have so many well-funded libertarians in American these days is not because libertarianism suddenly acquired an enormous grassroots following, but because it appeals to those who are able to fund ideas.  Like social Darwinism and Christian Science before it, libertarianism flatters the successful and rationalizes their core beliefs about the world.  They warm to the libertarian idea that taxation is theft because they themselves don’t like to pay taxes.  They fancy the libertarian notion that regulation is communist because they themselves find regulation intrusive and annoying.  Libertarianism is a politics born to be subsidized.  In the “free market of ideas,” it is a sure winner." -- Thomas Frank]]>
