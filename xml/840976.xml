	    <![CDATA["In college, I had a course in Latin, and one day the word &quot;divorce&quot; came up. I always figured it came from some root that meant &quot;divide.&quot; In truth, it comes from &quot;divertere,&quot; which means &quot;to divert.&quot;

I believe that. All divorce does is divert you, taking you away from everything you thought you knew and everything you thought you wanted and steering you into all kinds of other stuff, like discussions about your mother's girdle and whether she should marry someone else." -- Mitch Albom]]>
