	    <![CDATA["Parenthood is shit, snot, slime, fear, tears, spit, and spills. It’s as intense as combat, which is to say hours of tedium relieved by moments of alarm and flashes of joy to remind you that you’re alive. It is intensely practical and profoundly square, even if you’re not. It’s feeding, wiping, and picking up." -- Scott Simon]]>

	    <![CDATA["I cannot understand anti-abortion arguments that centre on the sanctity of life.  As a species we've fairly comprehensively demonstrated that we don't believe in the sanctity of life.  The shrugging acceptance of war, famine, epidemic, pain and life-long poverty shows us that, whatever we tell ourselves, we've made only the most feeble of efforts to &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; treat human life as sacred." -- Caitlin Moran]]>

	    <![CDATA["It's the silliness--the profligacy, and the silliness--that's so dizzying: a seven-year-old will run downstairs, kiss you hard, and then run back upstairs again, all in less than 30 seconds.  It's as urgent an item on their daily agenda as eating or singing.  It's like being mugged by Cupid." -- Caitlin Moran]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Ruth tells me at least once a day that old people, or people getting old, tend to disengage, back away, turn inward, listen only to themselves, and get self-righteous and censorious.  And they &lt;i&gt;mustn't.&lt;/i&gt;  (I mustn't.)" -- Wallace Stegner]]>
