	    <![CDATA["There are random moments - tossing a salad, coming up the driveway to the house, ironing the seams flat on a quilt square, standing at the kitchen window and looking out at the delphiniums, hearing a burst of laughter from one of my children's rooms - when I feel a wavelike rush of joy. This is my true religion: arbitrary moments of of nearly painful happiness for a life I feel privileged to lead." -- Elizabeth Berg]]>

	    <![CDATA["Sometimes I think illness sits inside every woman, waiting for the right moment to bloom.  I have known so many sick women all my life.  Women with chronic pain, with ever-gestating diseases.  Women with conditions.  Men, sure, they have bone snaps, they have backaches, they have a surgery or two, yank out a tonsil, insert a shiny plastic hip.  Women get consumed." -- Gillian Flynn]]>
