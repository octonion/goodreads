	    <![CDATA["Isn't your mom the goddess of inventors?&quot; I asked. 
Annabeth glared at me. &quot;Yes, but this is different. I'm good with &lt;i&gt;ideas&lt;/i&gt;. Not Mechanics.&quot;
If I was going to pick one person in the world to reattach my head,&quot; I said &quot;I'd pick you.&quot;
I just blurted it out - to give her confidence, I guess - but immediately I realized it sounded pretty stupid.
Awww...&quot; Silena sniffled and wiped her eyes. &quot;Percy that is &lt;i&gt;so&lt;/i&gt; sweet!" -- Rick Riordan]]>

She knows I hate that name, mostly because I never have a good comeback. She's the daughter of Athena, which doesn't give me a lot of ammunition. I mean, &quot;Owl-head&quot; and &quot;Wise Girl&quot; are kind of lame insults." -- Rick Riordan]]>

She didn't even wait for my answer before darting off into the woods.
I looked at Beckendorf. &quot;Did she just...ask me out?&quot;
He shrugged, completely disgusted. &quot;Who knows with girls? Give me a haywire dragon, any day.&quot;
So we sat together and waited while the girls won the game." -- Rick Riordan]]>

Grover cracked a smile. &quot;The dam snack bar?&quot;
Zoe blinked. &quot;Yes. What is funny?&quot;
&quot;Nothing,&quot; Grover said, trying to keep a straight face. &quot;I could use some dam french fries.&quot;
Even Thalia smiled at that. &quot;And I need to use the dam restroom.&quot;
...
I started cracking up, and Thalia and Grover joined in, while Zoe just looked at me. &quot;I do not understand.&quot;
&quot;I want to use the dam water fountain,&quot; Grover said.
&quot;And...&quot; Thalia tried to catch her breath. &quot;I want to buy a dam t-shirt." -- Rick Riordan]]>

	    <![CDATA["Grover was sniffing the wind, looking nervous. He fished out his acorns and threw them into the sand, then played his pipes. They rearranged themselves in a pattern that made no sense to me, but Grover looked concerned.

	    <![CDATA["In a way, it's nice to know that there are Greek gods out there, because you have somebody to blame when things go wrong. For instance, when you're walking away from a bus that's just been attacked by monster hags and blown up by lightning, and it's raining on top of everything else, most people might think that's just really bad luck; when you're a half-blood, you understand that some devine force is really trying to mess up your day." -- Rick Riordan]]>

	Apollo frowned. “Was it?”
	“Yes. What about &lt;i&gt;I am so bigheaded?”&lt;/i&gt;
	“No, no, that’s six syllable, hhhm.” He started muttering to himself.
Zoe Nightshade turned to us. “Lord Apollo has been going through this haiku phase ever since he visited Japan. Tis not as bad as the time he visited Limerick. If I’d had to hear one more poem that started with, &lt;i&gt;There once was a godess from Sparta-&quot;&lt;/i&gt;
	“I’ve got it!” Apollo announced. “&lt;i&gt;I am so awesome.&lt;/i&gt; That’s five syllables!” He bowed, looking very pleased with himself." -- Rick Riordan]]>

When he sat forward in his throne, shadowy faces appeared in the folds of his black robes, faces of torment,as if the garment was stitched of trapped souls from the Fields of Punishment, trying to get out.

	    <![CDATA["The real story of the Fleece: there were these two children of Zeus, Cadmus and Europa, okay? They were about to get offered up as human sacrifices, when they prayed to Zeus to save them. So Zeus sent this magical flying ram with golden wool, which picked them up in Greece and carried them all the way to Colchis in Asia Minor. Well, actually it carried Cadmus. Europa fell off and died along the way, but that's not important.&quot;
&quot;It was probably important to her." -- Rick Riordan]]>
