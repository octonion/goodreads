		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Have it compose a poem- a poem about a haircut!  But lofty, tragic, timeless, full of love, treachery, retribution, quiet heroism in the face of certain doom!  Six lines, cleverly rhymed, and every word beginning with the letter S!!” [sic]….
	Seduced, shaggy Samson snored.
	She scissored short.  Sorely shorn,
	Soon shackled slave, Samson sighed,
	Silently scheming
	Sightlessly seeking
	Some savage, spectacular suicide.&quot;

	(&quot;The First Sally (A) or The Electronic Bard&quot; 
THE CYBERIAD)" -- Stanislaw Lem]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["…the extent to which a society focuses on the needs of its lowest common denominator is the extent to which that society’ll be mired in mediocrity.  Whereas, if we would aim the bulk of our support at the brightest, most talented, most virtuous instead, then they would have the wherewithal to solve a lot of our problems, to uplift the whole culture, enlighten it or something, so that eventually there wouldn’t be so many losers and weaklings impeding evolution and dragging the whole species down….  Martyrs…just perpetuate human misery by catering to it….  Individuals have to take responsibility for their own lives and accept the consequences of their choices." -- Tom Robbins]]>

And you seek him for peace.

Wrestler of legends
A hive of hornets
