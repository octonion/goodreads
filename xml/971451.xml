	    <![CDATA["I can worship Nature, and that fulfills my need for miracles and beauty.  Art gives a spiritual depth to existence -- I can find worlds bigger and deeper than my own in music, paintings, and books.  And from my friends and family I receive the highest benediction, emotional contact, and personal affirmation.  I can bow before the works of Man, from buildings to babies, and that fulfills my need for wonder.  I can believe in the sanctity of Life, and that becomes the Revealed Word, to live my life as I believe it should be, not as I'm told to by self-appointed guides." -- Neil Peart]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The doctrine of the mean (the epithet 'golden' is un-Aristotelian) regularly occurs in later writers as a piece of moral advice -- a recipe or rule reminding us to 'observe the mean', to be moderate in all things and to avoid excess and deciciency.  (If the doctrine urges us not to drink too much wine, it equally urges us not to drink too little -- but that is something which the moralizers usually find it prudent to ignore.)" -- Jonathan Barnes]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Most problems of teaching are not problems of growth but helping cultivate growth.  As far as I know, and this is only from personal experience in teaching, I think about ninety percent of the problem in teaching, or maybe ninety-eight percent, is just to help the students get interested.  Or what it usually amounts to is to not prevent them from being interested.  Typically they come in interested, and the process of education is a way of driving that defect out of their minds.  But if children['s] ... normal interest is maintained or even aroused, they can do all kinds of things in ways we don't understand." -- Noam Chomsky]]>

	    <![CDATA["Napoleon said of Massena, that he was not himself until the battle began to go against him; then, when the dead began to fall in ranks around him, awoke his powers of combination, and he put on terror and victory as a robe.  So it is in rugged crises, in unweariable endurance, and in aims which put sympathy out of question, that the angel is shown." -- Ralph Waldo Emerson]]>
