	    <![CDATA["If we're going to die there's no harm in telling me pretty lies, In the end it won't matter, and I'll die happy.&quot;
&quot;I have no intention of letting either of us die. And then where would the lies get us?&quot;
&quot;If you manage to keep us alive then I promise I'll forget. Just tell me you care about me. If we're going to die then how important is the truth?&quot;
&quot;It's because we might die that the truth is particularly important,And telling you that I care about you is a waste of time. I wouldn't have crossed the ocean, come out of hiding and tracked you down if
you didn't matter to me.&quot;
&quot;Then come up with a better lie. Tell me you love me.&quot;
&quot;You don't need lies, Chloe,I do love you.&quot; he said." -- Anne Stuart]]>
