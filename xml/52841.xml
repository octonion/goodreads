		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The best thing for being sad,&quot; replied Merlin, beginning to puff and blow, &quot;is to learn something. That's the only thing that never fails. You may grow old and trembling in your anatomies, you may lie awake at night listening to the disorder of your veins, you may miss your only love, you may see the world about you devastated by evil lunatics, or know your honour trampled in the sewers of baser minds. There is only one thing for it then — to learn. Learn why the world wags and what wags it. That is the only thing which the mind can never exhaust, never alienate, never be tortured by, never fear or distrust, and never dream of regretting. Learning is the only thing for you. Look what a lot of things there are to learn." -- T.H. White]]>

	    <![CDATA["If there is no love in the world, we will make a new world, and we will give it walls, and we will furnish it with soft, red interiors, from the inside out, and give it a knocker that resonates like a diamond falling to a jeweller's felt so that we should never hear it. Love me, because love doesn't exist, and I have tried everything that does." -- Jonathan Safran Foer]]>

	    <![CDATA["She's had a long life. Now she's going to the Lord.&quot;
   &quot;Frankly it creeps me out a little when you say things like that,&quot; Simon said.
   &quot;It shouldn't. If you don't like 'Lord,' pick another word. She's going home. She's going back to the party. Whatever you like.&quot;
   &quot;I suppose you have some definite ideas about an afterlife.&quot;
   &quot;Sure. We get reabsorbed into the earthly and celestial mechanism.&quot;
   &quot;No heaven?&quot;
   &quot;That's heaven.&quot;
   &quot;What about realms of glory? What about walking around in golden slippers?&quot;
   &quot;We abandon consciousness as if we were waking from a bad dream. We throw it off like clothes that never fit us right. It's an ecstatic release we're physically unable to apprehend while we're in our bodies. Orgasm is our best hint, but it's crude and minor by comparison." -- Michael Cunningham]]>

	    <![CDATA["I wish for a moment that time would lift me out of this day, and into some more benign one. But then I feel guilty for wanting to avoid the sadness; dead people need us to remember them, even if it eats us, even if all we can do is say &quot;I'm sorry&quot; until it is as meaningless air." -- Audrey Niffenegger]]>

He tore apart the plot - see his music was immediately on top of his own life. Echoing. As if, when he was playing he was lost and hunting for the right accidental notes. Listening to him was like talking to Coleman. You were both changing direction with every sentence, sometimes in the middle, using each other as a springboard through the dark. You were moving so fast it was unimportant to finish and clear everything. He would be describing something in 27 ways. There was pain and gentleness everything jammed into each number." -- Michael Ondaatje]]>

I used to think I could teach young people the whole of life, but I know better now, and all my teaching of George has come down to this: beware of muddle." -- E. M. Forster]]>

	    <![CDATA["It isn't possible to love and part.  You will wish that it was.  You can transmute love, ignore it, muddle it, but you can never pull it out of you. I know by experience that the poets are right:  love is eternal." -- E.M. Forster]]>

	    <![CDATA["The kingdom of music is not the kingdom of this world; it will accept those whom breeding and intellect and culture have alike rejected. The commonplace person begins to play, and shoots into the empyrean without effort, whilst we look up, marvelling how he has escaped us, and thinking how we could worship him and love him, would he but translate his visions into human words, and his experiences into human actions. Perhaps he cannot; certainly he does not, or does so very seldom." -- E.M. Forster]]>
