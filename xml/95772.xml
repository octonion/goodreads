	    <![CDATA["THE MANY FACES OF SURVIVAL

Sunday, August 10th at 2:00 PST

Dachau Liberator, medical whistle-blower, award winning writer, college professor and world renowned garlic farmer, Chester Aaron, talks about the hard choices he’s had to make, why he made them, and how it’s changed his life.  

Mr. Aaron was recognized by the National Endowment for the Arts, and received the Huntington Hartford Foundation fellowship which was chaired by Aldous Huxley and Tomas Mann.  He also inspired Ralph Nader to expose the over-radiation of blacks in American hospitals. 

Now Mr. Aaron is a world-renowned garlic farmer who spends his days writing about the liberation of Dachau.  He is 86 years old and he has a thousand stories to tell. Although he has published over 17 books, he is still writing more and looks forward to publishing again soon." -- Judy Gregerson]]>
