	    <![CDATA["It seemed to him that he had stepped through a high window that looked on a vanished world. A light was upon it for which his language had no name. All that he saw was shapely, but the shapes seemed at once clear cut, as if they had been first conceived and drawn at the uncovering of his eyes, and ancient as if they had endured for ever. He saw no colour but those he knew, gold and white and blue and green, but they were fresh and poignant, as if he had at that moment first perceived them and made names for them new and wonderful. In winter here no heart could mourn for summer or for spring. No blemish or sickness or deformity could be seen in anything that grew upon the earth. On the land of Lorien there was no stain." -- J. R. R. Tolkien]]>

	    <![CDATA["For the love of men like Fitzpiers is unquestionably of such quality as to bear division and transference. He had indeed once declared, though not to her, that on one occasion he had noticed himself to be possessed by five distinct infatuations at the same time. If this were true, his differed from the highest affection as the lower orders of the animal world differ from advanced organisms, partition causing not death but a multiplied existence." -- Thomas Hardy]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I am a sick man... I am a spiteful man.  I am an unpleasant man.  I think my liver is diseased.  However, I don't know beans about my disease, and I am not sure what is bothering me.  I don't treat it and never have, though I respect medicine and doctors.  Besides, I am extremely superstitious, let's say sufficiently so to respect medicine.  (I am educated enough not to be superstitious, but I am.)  No, I refuse to treat it out of spite.  You probably will not understand that.  Well, but I understand it.  Of course I can't explain to you just whom I am annoying in this case by my spite.  I am perfectly well aware that I cannot &quot;get even&quot; with the doctors by not consulting them.  I know better than anyone that I thereby injure only myself and no one else.  But still, if I don't treat it, its is out of spite.  My liver is bad, well then-- let it get even worse!" -- Fyodor Dostoevsky]]>

	    <![CDATA["A man can love too.'
'No; -- hardly.  He can admire, and he can like, and he can fondle and be fond.  He can admire and approve, and perhaps worship.  He can know of a woman that she is part of himself, the most sacred part, and therefore will protect her from the very winds.  But all that will not make love.  It does not come to a man that to be separated from a woman is to be dislocated from his very self.  A man has but one centre, and that is himself.  A woman has two.  Though the second may never been seen by her, may live in the arms of another, may do all for that other that man can do for woman, -- still, still, though he be half the globe asunder from her, still he is to her the half of her existence.  If she really love, there is, I fancy no end of it." -- Anthony Trollope]]>
