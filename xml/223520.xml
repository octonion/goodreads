		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The moon changes each night but she does so in an understandable rhythm. And just as the tides ebb and flow and the moon waxes and wanes, our bodies’ hormones ebb and flow and our energies wax and wane. Our bodies are more like the rivers than like the rocks, more like the oceans than like machines. The more we can respect the cycles and changes and needs of our bodies, the more we can move with the flow of our lives.

In other words, swear by the moon.  Or, trust your body." -- Golda Poretsky]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I’m not saying that you should deny the difficult events of your life. But the fact that you survived is also a wonderful story to tell. And that story, the story of the way you came through a difficult situation, found resources within yourself or outside of yourself, gleaned from that experience what you wanted and what you didn’t want going forward — that is a story that can inspire you and others to heal and grow." -- Golda Poretsky]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I think fitting in is highly overrated. I’d rather just fit out... Fitting out means being who you are, even when people insist that you have to change. Fitting out means taking up space, not apologizing for yourself, and not agreeing with those who seek to label you with stereotypes." -- Golda Poretsky]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Body acceptance means, as much as possible, approving of and loving your body, despite its “imperfections”, real or perceived.  That means accepting that your body is fatter than some others, or thinner than some others, that your eyes are a little crooked, that you have a disability that makes walking difficult, that you have health concerns that you have to deal with — but that all of that doesn’t mean that you need to be ashamed of your body or try to change it.  Body acceptance allows for the fact that there is a diversity of bodies in the world, and that there’s no wrong way to have one." -- Golda Poretsky]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Weight and body oppression is oppressive to everyone. When you live in a society that says that one kind of body is bad and and other is good, those with “good” bodies constantly fear that their bodies will go “bad”, and those with “bad” bodies are expected feel shame and do everything they can to have “good” bodies.  In the process, we torture our bodies, and do everything from engage in disordered eating to invasive surgery to make ourselves okay.  Nobody wins in this kind of struggle." -- Golda Poretsky]]>

	    <![CDATA["Beauty shouldn’t be about changing yourself to achieve an ideal or be more socially acceptable. Real beauty, the interesting, truly pleasing kind, is about honoring the beauty within you and without you. It’s about knowing that someone else’s definition of pretty has no hold over you." -- Golda Poretsky]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Sometimes you need a reminder that negative comments about your body aren’t even really about your body, they’re about society and our society’s wrongheaded and impossibly narrow definition of a “good” body. Your body didn’t do anything wrong. What’s fucked up about your body is not your body at all, but that your body has to live in a society that thinks it has a right to say fucked up things about your body." -- Golda Poretsky]]>
