		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Over the years, I have perfected my “just rolled out of bed” style by, more often than not, just rolling out of bed. I’ve cultivated the look since I’ve found that ladies like my messy hair—it’s an excuse to run their fingers through it. More important, it’s yet another component to my whole strategy: nothing works better in a wolf’s quest for getting laid than looking like you’ve just gotten laid." -- Edward Vilga]]>

	    <![CDATA["All empires fall, eventually.” 
“But why? It’s not for lack of power. In fact, it seems to be the opposite. Their power lulls them into comfort. They become undisciplined. Those who had to earn power are replaced by those who have known nothing else. Who have no comprehension of the need to rise above base desires.[”]" -- Max Barry]]>

	    <![CDATA["She had been in situations like this, where people said, Convince me, and in none of those had they actually wanted to be convinced. She could lay down a perfect argument and they just invented new bullshit on the spot to justify why the answer was still no. When people said, Convince me, she knew it didn’t mean they had an open mind. It meant they had power and wanted to enjoy it a minute." -- Max Barry]]>

	    <![CDATA["Good words were the difference between Emily eating well and not. And what she had found worked best were not facts or arguments but words that tickled people’s brains for some reason, that just amused them. Puns, and exaggerations, and things that were true and not at the same time." -- Max Barry]]>
