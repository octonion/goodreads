Only that it’s yours. Similarly, why live your life? Because it’s yours. But what if such an answer becomes less and less convincing?" -- Julian Barnes]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["My education has been so unwitting I can't quite tell which of my thoughts come from me and which from my books, but that's how I've stayed attuned to myself and the world around me for the past thirty-five years. Because when I read, I don't really read; I pop a beautiful sentence into my mouth and suck it like a fruit drop, or I sip it like a liqueur until the thought dissolves in me like alcohol, infusing brain and heart and coursing on through the veins to the root of each blood vessel." -- Bohumil Hrabal]]>
