If I knew that this would be the last time you pass through this door, I’d embrace you, kiss you, and call you back for one more. If I knew that this would be the last time I would hear your voice, I’d take hold of each word to be able to hear it over and over again. If I knew this is the last time I see you, I’d tell you I love you, and would not just assume foolishly you know it already." -- Gabriel García Márquez]]>

	    <![CDATA["Unless a man has pity he is not truly a man.  If a man has not wept at the worlds pain he is only half a man, and there will always be pain in the world, knowing this does not mean that a man shall dispair.  A good man will seek to take pain out of things.  A foolish man will not even notice it, except in himself,  and the poor unfortunate evil man will drive pain deeper into things and spread it about wherever he goes." -- William Saroyan]]>
