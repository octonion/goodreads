	    <![CDATA["Loneliness is black coffee and late-night television; solitude is herb tea and soft music.  Solitude, quality solitude, is an assertion of self-worth, because only in the stillness can we hear the truth of our own unique voices." -- Pearl Cleage]]>

	    <![CDATA["I am an expression of the divine, just like a peach is, just like a fish is. I have a right to be this way...I can't apologize for that, nor can I change it, nor do I want to... We will never have to be other than who we are in order to be successful...We realize that we are as ourselves unlimited and our experiences valid. It is for the rest of the world to recognize this, if they choose." -- Alice Walker]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["When you need to be loved, you take love wherever you can find it. When you are desperate to be loved, feel love, know love, you seek out what you think love should look like. When you find love, or what you think love is, you will lie, kill, and steal to keep it. But learning about real love comes from within. It cannot be given. It cannot be taken away. It grows from your ability to re-create within yourself, the essence of loving experiences you have had in your life." -- Iyanla Vanzant]]>
