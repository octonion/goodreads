	    <![CDATA["America is the greatest engine of innovation that has ever existed, and it can't be duplicated anytime soon, because it is the product of a multitude of factors: extreme freedom of thought, an emphasis on independent thinking, a steady immigration of new minds, a risk-taking culture with no stigma attached to trying and failing, a noncorrupt bureaucracy, and financial markets and a venture capital system that are unrivaled at taking new ideas and turning them into global products." -- Thomas L. Friedman]]>

	    <![CDATA["I laugh at myself. 
I don't take myself completely seriously. 
I think that's another quality that people have to hold on to... you have to laugh, especially at yourself." -- Madonna]]>
