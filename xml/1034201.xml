		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The subtlest change in New York is something people don't speak much about but that is in everyone's mind. The city, for the first time in its long history, is destructible. A single flight of planes no bigger than a wedge of geese can quickly end this island fantasy, burn the towers, crumble the bridges, turn the underground passages into lethal chambers, cremate the millions. The intimation of mortality is part of New York now: in the sound of jets overhead, in the black headlines of the latest edition. (Written in 1949, 22 years before the World Trade Center was completed.)" -- E.B. White]]>

She was a traditionally built lady, after all, and she did not have to worry about dress size, unlike those poor, neurotic people who were always looking in mirrors and thinking that they were too big.  What was too big, anyway?  Who was to tell another person what size they should be?  It was a form of dictatorship, by the thin, and she was not having any of it.  If these thin people became any more insistent, then the more generously sized people would just have to sit on them.  Yes, that would teach them! Hah!" -- Alexander McCall Smith]]>
