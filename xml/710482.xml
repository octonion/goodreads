		<description>
	    <![CDATA["When you plant lettuce, if it does not grow well, you 
don't blame the lettuce.  You look for reasons it is not 
doing well.  It may need fertilizer, or more water, or 
less sun.  You never blame the lettuce. Yet if we have 
problems with our friends or family, we blame the other 
person. But if we know how to take care of them, they will 
grow well, like the lettuce.  Blaming has no positive 
effect at all, nor does trying to persuade using reason 
and argument. That is my experience.  No blame, no 
reasoning, no argument, just understanding. If you 
understand, and you show that you understand, you can 
love, and the situation will change" -- Thich Nhat Hanh]]>
