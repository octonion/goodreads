	    <![CDATA["Early love is exciting and exhilarating.  It's light and bubbly.  Anyone can love like that.  But after three children, after a separation and a near-divorce, after you've hurt each other and forgiven each other, bored each other and surprised each other, after you've seen the worst and the best-- well, that sort of love is ineffable.  It deserves its own word." -- Liane Moriarty]]>
