		<description>
	    <![CDATA["When He [God] talks of their losing their selves, He means only abandoning the clamour of self-will; once they have done that, He really gives them back all their personality, and boasts (I am afraid, sincerely) that when they are wholly His they will be more themselves than ever." -- C.S. Lewis]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["You must therefore zealously guard in his mind the curious assumption 'My time is my own'.  Let him have the feeling that he starts each day as the lawful possessor of twenty-four hours.  Let him feel as a grievous tax that portion of this property which he has to make over to him employers, and as a generous donation that further portion which h allows to religious duties.  But what he must never be permitted to doubt is that the total from which these deductions have been made was, in some mysterious sense, his own personal birthright." -- C.S. Lewis]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["It does not matter how small the sins are provided that their cumulative effect is to edge the man away from the Light and out into the Nothing.  Murder is no better than cards if cards can do the trick.  Indeed the safest road to Hell is the gradual one--the gentle slope, soft underfoot, without sudden turnings, without milestones, without signposts." -- C.S. Lewis]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Whatever he says, let his inner resolution be not to bear whatever comes to him, but to bear it 'for a reasonable period'--and let the reasonable period be shorter than the trial is likely to last.  It need not be much shorter; in attacks on patience, chastity, and fortitude, the fun is to make the man yield just when (had he but known it) relief was almost in sight." -- C.S. Lewis]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Queer, how her own desperate need of light seemed to throw such brilliance over the affairs of the members of her family.  She carried her need like a many-batteried pocket spotlight, illuminating emotional corners in other people, but she walked in darkness behind it.  Her wrist wouldn't bend to turn it on herself." -- Helen Hull]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Marriage or no marriage, children or no children, life - the real life - is lived in the spirit, and I hold that the right education helps the spirit to maintain its own life, makes it independent of material prosperity or adversity.

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["It matters to ourselves, of course, but it matters terribly to other people.  Moral failure or spiritual failure or whatever you call it, makes such a vicious circle...  It seems as if when we love people and they fall short, we retaliate by falling shorter ourselves.  Children are like that.  Adults have a fearful responsibility.  When they fail to live up to what children expect of them, the children give up themselves.  So each generation keeps failing the next." -- Dorothy Whipple]]>
