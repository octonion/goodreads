		<description>
	    <![CDATA["To find the universal elements enough; to find the air and the water exhilarating; to be refreshed by a morning walk or an evening saunter... to be thrilled by the stars at night; to be elated over a bird's nest or a wildflower in spring â€” these are some of the rewards of the simple life." -- John Burroughs]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["That's what I love about reading: one tiny thing will interest you in a book, and that tiny thing will lead you to another book, and another bit there will lead you onto a third book. It's geometrically progressive - all with no end in sight, and for no other reason than sheer enjoyment." -- Mary Ann Shaffer]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["People like it when you tell them things, in suitable portions, in a modest, intimate tone, and they think they know you, but they do not, they know _about_ you, for what they are let in on are facts, not feelings, not what your opinion is about anything at all, not how what has happened to you and how all the decisions you have made have turned you into who you are. What they do is they fill in with their own feelings and opinions and assumptions, and they compose a new life which has precious little to do with yours, and that lets you off the hook. No-one can touch you unless you yourself want them to." -- Per Petterson]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["You see, women are like fires, like flames.  Some women are like candles, bright and friendly.  Some are like single sparks, or embers, like fireflies for chasing on summer nights.  Some are like campfires, all light and heat for a night and willing to be left after.  Some women are like hearthfires, not much to look at but underneath they are all warm red coal that burns a long, long while." -- Patrick Rothfuss]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Books can be possessive, can't they? You're walking around in a bookstore and a certain one will jump out at you, like it had moved there on its own, just to get your attention. Sometimes what's inside will change your life, but sometimes you don't even have to read it. Sometimes it's a comfort just to have a book around.  Many of these books haven't even had their spines cracked.  'Why do you buy books you don't even read?' our daughter asks us.  That's like asking someone who lives alone why they bought a cat.  For company, of course." -- Sarah Addison Allen]]>
