	    <![CDATA["No matter how careful you are, there's going to be the sense you missed something, the collapsed feeling under your skin that you didn't experience it all. There's that fallen heart feeling that you rushed right through the moments where you should've been paying attention.
Well, get used to that feeling. That's how your whole life will feel some day.
This is all practice." -- Chuck Palahniuk]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["There are only patterns, patterns on top of patterns, patterns that affect other patterns. Patterns hidden by patterns. Patterns within patterns. 
If you watch close, history does nothing but repeat itself. 
What we call chaos is just patterns we haven't recognized. What we call random is just patterns we can't decipher. what we can't understand we call nonsense. What we can't read we call gibberish.
There is no free will. 
There are no variables." -- Chuck Palahniuk]]>

&quot;Come on,&quot; I said. &quot;You're pie-eyed.&quot;
&quot;Pretty nice stuffed dogs,&quot; Bill said. &quot;Certainly brighten up your flat.&quot;

&quot;Just one stuffed dog. I can take 'em or leave 'em alone. But listen, Jake. Just one stuffed dog.&quot;
