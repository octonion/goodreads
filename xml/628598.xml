	    <![CDATA["You're afraid of making mistakes. Don't be. Mistakes can be profited by. Man, when I was young I shoved my ignorance in people's faces. They beat me with sticks. By the time I was forty my blunt instrument had been honed to a fine cutting point for me. If you hide your ignorance, no one will hit you and you'll never learn." -- Ray Bradbury]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I don't know exactly where ideas come from, but when I'm working well ideas just appear. I've heard other people say similar things - so it's one of the ways I know there's help and guidance out there. It's just a matter of our figuring out how to receive the ideas or information that are waiting to be heard." -- Jim Henson]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["For I was, as you have already guessed, a collaborator with Destiny, not one who put a pistol to its head and demanded particular treasures.  The only thing for me to do was to keep on keeping on, to have faith in my whim, and remember that for me, as for the saints, illumination when it came would probably come from some unexpected source." -- Robertson Davies]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The gift that isn't big enough to make a mark, but is too big to leave the possessor in peace.  And so they can't be content to be Sunday painters, or poets who write for a few friends, or composers whose handful of delicate little settings of Emily Dickinson can't find a singer.  It's a special sort of hell." -- Robertson Davies]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["We have educated ourselves into a world from which wonder, and he fear and dread and splendor and freedom of wonder have been banished. Of course wonder is costly. You couldn't incorporate it into a modern state, beacuse it is the antithesis of the anxiously worshiped security which is what a modern state is asked to give. Wonder is marvellous but it is also cruel, cruel, cruel. It is undemocratic, discriminatory and pitiless." -- Robertson Davies]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["To ask an author who hopes to be a serious writer if his work is autobiographical is like asking a spider where he buys his thread. The spider gets his thread right out of his own guts, and that is where the author gets his writing." -- Robertson Davies]]>
