		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Who has never killed an hour? Not casually or without thought, but carefully: a premeditated murder of minutes. The violence comes from a combination of giving up, not caring, and a resignation that getting past it is all you can hope to accomplish. So you kill the hour. You do not work, you do not read, you do not daydream. If you sleep it is not because you need to sleep. And when at last it is over, there is no evidence: no weapon, no blood, and no body. The only clue might be the shadows beneath your eyes or a terribly thin line near the corner of your mouth indicating something has been suffered, that in the privacy of your life you have lost something and the loss is too empty to share." -- Mark Z. Danielewski]]>

But conversely, the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man&amp;mdash;for precisely the same reasons." -- Douglas Adams]]>

	    <![CDATA["In the beginning, God created the earth, and he looked upon it in his cosmic loneliness.

And God said, &quot;Let Us make living creatures out of mud, so the mud can see what We have done.&quot; And God created every living creature that now moveth, and one was man. Mud as man alone could speak. God leaned close to mud as man sat, looked around, and spoke. &quot;What is the purpose of all this?&quot; he asked politely.

&quot;Everything must have a purpose?&quot; asked God.

&quot;Certainly,&quot; said man.

&quot;Then I leave it to you to think of one for all this,&quot; said God.

And He went away." -- Kurt Vonnegut]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["God made mud.
God got lonesome.
So God said to some of the mud, &quot;Sit up!&quot;
&quot;See all I've made,&quot; said God, &quot;the hills, the sea, the
sky, the stars.&quot;
And I was some of the mud that got to sit up and look
around.
Lucky me, lucky mud.
I, mud, sat up and saw what a nice job God had done.
Nice going, God.
Nobody but you could have done it, God! I certainly
couldn't have.
I feel very unimportant compared to You.
The only way I can feel the least bit important is to
think of all the mud that didn't even get to sit up and
look around.
I got so much, and most mud got so little.
Thank you for the honor!
Now mud lies down again and goes to sleep.
What memories for mud to have!
What interesting other kinds of sitting-up mud I met!
I loved everything I saw!
Good night.
I will go to heaven now.
I can hardly wait...
To find out for certain what my wampeter was...
And who was in my karass...
And all the good things our karass did for you.
Amen." -- Kurt Vonnegut]]>
