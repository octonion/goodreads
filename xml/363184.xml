	    <![CDATA["The light dove, in free flight cutting through the air the resistance of which it feels, could get the idea that it could do even better in airless space.  Likewise, Plato abandoned the world of the senses because it posed so many hindrances for the understanding, and dared to go beyond it on the wings of the ideas, in the empty space of pure understanding." -- Immanuel Kant]]>

	    <![CDATA["Yet, even now, ever time (often) that I find that I don't understand something, then instinctively, I'm filled with the hope that perhaps this will be my moment again, perhaps once again I shall understand nothing, I shall grasp that other knowledge, found and lost in an instant." -- Italo Calvino]]>
