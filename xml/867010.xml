	    <![CDATA["Depression is not madness, it's just depression, the loser version, the low-energy response to bad stuff that happens in your life. When you're depressed, you think you're the only one to have ever tasted this kind of hurt. And that lonely self-regard brings with it its own painful pleasure." -- Ana Menendez]]>

	    <![CDATA["Kittridge closed his eyes. So, the end. It would happen instantaneously, a painless departure, quicker than thought. he felt the presence of his body one last time: the taste of air in his lungs, the blood surging in his veins, the drumlike beating of his heart. The bomb was dropping toward them.
&quot;I've got you,&quot; he said, hugging Tim fiercely; and again, over and over, so that the boy would be hearing these words. &quot;I've got you, I've got you, I've got you, I've got you." -- Justin Cronin]]>
