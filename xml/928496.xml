	    <![CDATA["I'm begging you, to come be with me.&quot; And she pressed her mouth against his and murmured against his lips. &quot;Forever.&quot;

For a few seconds he didn't respond.

Then a groan escaped his throat and he thrust his fingers in her hair, pulling her mouth back to his with a fierce hunger.

&quot;Kiss me,&quot; she whispered. &quot;And don't stop." -- Aprilynne Pike]]>
