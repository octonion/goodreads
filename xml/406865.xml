		<description>
	    <![CDATA["But what force in the galaxy is stronger than she is?&quot;

&quot;Indifference.&quot; Jerusha surprised herself with the answer. &quot;Indifference, Gundhalinu, is the strongest force in the universe. It makes everything it touches meaningless. Love and hate don't stand a chance against it. It lets neglect and decay and monstrous injustice go unchecked. It doesn't act, it allows. And that's what gives it so much power." -- Joan D. Vinge]]>
