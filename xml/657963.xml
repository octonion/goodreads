		<description>
	    <![CDATA["When you don't fit in, you become superhuman. You can feel everyone else's eyes on you, stuck like Velcro. You can hear a whisper about you from a mile away. You can disappear, even when it looks like you're still standing right there. You can scream, and nobody hears a sound.
You become the mutant who fell into the vat of acid, the Joker who can't remove his mask, the bionic man who's missing all his limbs and none of his heart.
You are the thing that used to be normal, but that was so long ago, you can't even remember what it was like. " -- Jodi Picoult]]>

	    <![CDATA["Saying 'I notice you're a nerd' is like saying, 'Hey, I notice that you'd rather be intelligent than be stupid, that you'd rather be thoughtful than be vapid, that you believe that there are things that matter more than the arrest record of Lindsay Lohan. Why is that?' In fact, it seems to me that most contemporary insults are pretty lame. Even 'lame' is kind of lame. Saying 'You're lame' is like saying 'You walk with a limp.' Yeah, whatever, so does 50 Cent, and he's done all right for himself." -- John Green]]>

	    <![CDATA["How could he convey to someone who'd never even met her the way she always smelled like rain, or how his stomach knotted up every time he saw her shake loose her hair from its braid? How could he describe how it felt when she finished his sentences, turnec the mug they were sharing so that her mouth landed where his had been? How did he explain the way they could be in a locker room, or underwater, or in the piney woods of Maine, bus as long as Em was with him, he was at home?" -- Jodi Picoult]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["There are two kinds of love...in the safe kind you look for someone who's exactly like you. It's what most folks settle for. But then there's the other kind of love. Everyone's born with a ragged edge, and some folks crave that piece that's a perfect fit. You'll search for it forever, if you have to. And if you're lucky enough to find it, it looks so &lt;I&gt;right&lt;/I&gt;, you start to tear at your own seams, thinking, &lt;I&gt;maybe I could look just as perfect&lt;/I&gt;. But then, of course, when you try to get close to their other half, you don't fit anymore. That kind of love...you come out of it a different person than you were when you started." -- Jodi Picoult]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["If I had to tell you how humans made their way to Earth, it would go like this:  In the beginning, there was nothing at all but the moon and the sun.  And the moon wanted to come out during the day, but there was something so much brighter that seemed to fill up all those hours.  The moon grew hungry, thinner and thinner, until she was just a slice of herself, and her tips were as sharp as a knife.  By accident, because that is the way most things happen, she poked a hole in the night and out spilled a million stars, like a fountain of tears.
 
Horrified, the moon tried to swallow them up.  And sometimes this worked, because she got fatter and rounder..  But mostly it didn't, because there were just so many.  The stars kept coming, until they made the sky so bright that the sun got jealous.  He invited the stars to his side of the world, where it was always bright.  What he didn't tell them, though, was that in the daytime, they'd never be seen.  So the stupid ones leaped from the sky to the ground, and they froze under the weight of their own foolishness.
 
The moon did her best.  She carved each of these blocks of sorrow into a man or a woman.  She spent the rest of her time watching out so that her other stars wouldn't fall.  She spent the rest of her time holding onto whatever scraps she had left." -- Jodi Picoult]]>

Some people spend their whole lives looking for that one person. I was lucky enough to have her all along." -- Jodi Picoult]]>
