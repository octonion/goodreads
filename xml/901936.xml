	    <![CDATA["I believe that around us there is only one word on all sides, one immense word which reveals our solitude and extinguishes our radiance: Nothing!  I believe that that word does not point to our insignificance or our unhappiness, but on the contrary to our fulfillment and our divinity, since everything is in ourselves." -- Henri Barbusse]]>

	    <![CDATA["When I use a word,’ Humpty Dumpty said in rather a scornful tone, ‘it means just what I choose it to mean — neither more nor less.’

’The question is,’ said Alice, ‘whether you can make words mean so many different things.’

’The question is,’ said Humpty Dumpty, ‘which is to be master — that’s all." -- Lewis Carroll]]>

	    <![CDATA["And it came to me then. That we were wonderful traveling companions but in the end no more than lonely lumps of metal in their own separate orbits.  From far off they look like beautiful shooting stars, but in reality they're nothing more than prisons, where each of us is locked up alone, going nowhere. When the orbits of these two satellites of ours happened to cross paths, we could be together. Maybe even open our hearts to each other. But that was only for the briefest moment. In the next instant we'd be in absolute solitude. Until we burned up and became nothing." -- Haruki Murakami]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["While I was an honorable man in her eyes, she did not love me.  But the minute she understood what I was, when she breathed the true and foul odor of my soul, love was born in her – for she does love me!  Well, well!  There is nothing real, then, except evil." -- Octave Mirbeau]]>
