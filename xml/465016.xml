		<description>
	    <![CDATA["My kids are starting to notice I'm a little different from the other dads. &quot;Why don't you have a straight job like everyone else?&quot; they asked me the other day. 

I told them this story: 
In the forest, there was a crooked tree and a straight tree. Every day, the straight tree would say to the crooked tree, &quot;Look at me...I'm tall, and I'm straight, and I'm handsome. Look at you...you're all crooked and bent over. No one wants to look at you.&quot; And they grew up in that forest together. And then one day the loggers came, and they saw the crooked tree and the straight tree, and they said, &quot;Just cut the straight trees and leave the rest.&quot; So the loggers turned all the straight trees into lumber and toothpicks and paper. And the crooked tree is still there, growing stronger and stranger every day." -- Tom Waits]]>

Only those who are hard enough will succeed. Most people get crushed, but if you fight, in the end life will go, &quot;Fucking hell. This one's serious. Let him through." -- Russell Brand]]>

And one day, I threw them out into the yard. &quot;Oh, it's just a couple little innocent bad days.&quot; Well, we had a big rain. I don't know what it was growing in but I think we used to put eggshells out there and coffee grounds, too. Don't plant your bad days. They grow into weeks. The weeks grow into months. Before you know it you got yourself a bad year. Take it from me. Choke those little bad days. Choke 'em down to nothin'. They're your days. Choke 'em!" -- Tom Waits]]>

	    <![CDATA["Whatever I do, however I find a way to live, I will tell these stories.  I have spoken to every person I have encountered these last difficult days...I speak to these people, and I speak to you because I cannot help it.  It gives me strength, almost unbelievable strength, to know that you are there.  I covet your eyes, your ears, the collapsible space between us.  How blessed are we to have each other?  I am alive and you are alive and so we must fill the air with our words.  I will fill today, tomorrow, every day until I am taken back to God.  I will tell stories to people who will listen and to people who don't want to listen, to people who seek me out and to those who run.  All the while I will know that you are there.  How can I pretend that you do not exist?  It would be almost as impossible as you pretending that I do not exist." -- Dave Eggers]]>
