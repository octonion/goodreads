	    <![CDATA["He held her close and closed his eyes. “I would rather fail a thousand times with you than never take the chance.” 
     “That’s some line, Mr. Moore,” she whispered beside him. “I might have to steal it and put it in one of my books.”
     “It’s no line, Ms. Delome. It’s the truth, even if it does sound like fiction." -- Alexandrea Weis]]>

	    <![CDATA["Until you can embrace the wonder of life, you will never be able to accept the inevitability of change. Change is the energy that allows us to grow. And when we don’t grow…well, we become ghosts." -- Alexandrea Weis]]>

	    <![CDATA["Forget about him.” He traced his lips up the side of my neck to my earlobe, “Just do whatever feels right,” he whispered. 
His lips felt like warm silk against my skin. “I don’t think I ever knew how to do that,” I admitted. 
“I’ll show you. Making love is like a dance, darlin’. We must learn to move together as one." -- Alexandrea Weis]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["You remind me of the mare I just sold. She was always guarded, hesitant of every new adventure, and resisted me at every turn. If I rode her too hard, I would frighten her, and if I was too gentle, I would lose her interest. Took me a while, but I won her over……and I plan on doing the exact same thing with you." -- Alexandrea Weis]]>
