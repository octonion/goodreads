	    <![CDATA["We're living in momentous times, Garion. The events of a thousand years and more have all focused on these very days. The world, I'm told, is like that. Centuries pass when nothing happens, and then in a few short years events of such tremendous importance take place that the world is never the same again.&quot; 
I think that if I had my choice, I'd prefer one of those quiet centuries,&quot; Garion said glumly. 
Oh, no,&quot; Silk said, his lips drawing back in a ferretlike grin. &quot;Now's the time to be alive - to see it all happen, to be a part of it. That makes the blood race, and each breath is an adventure." -- David Eddings]]>
