	    <![CDATA["The center snaps the ball to the quarterback!&quot;
&quot;No he doesn't!&quot;
&quot;He doesn't?&quot;
&quot;NO!  Secretly, he's the quarterback for the other team!  He keeps the ball!&quot;
&quot;A traitor!&quot;
&quot;Calvin breaks for the goal.&quot;
&quot;Wheeee!  He's at the 30... the 20... the 10!  Nobody can catch him!&quot;
&quot;Nobody wants to!  Your running toward your own goal!&quot;
&quot;Huh?!&quot;
&quot;When I learned that you were a spy, I switched goals.  This is your goal and mine's hidden!&quot;
&quot;Hidden?!&quot;
&quot;You'll never find it in a million years!&quot;
&quot;I don't need to find it as a traitor to your team, crossing my goal counts as crossing your goal!&quot;
&quot;Ah, so you might think so...&quot;
&quot;In fact, I know so!&quot;
&quot;But the place I hid my goal is right on top of your goal, so the points will go to me!&quot;
&quot;But the fact is, I'm really a double agent!  I'm on your team after all, which means you'll lose points if I cross your goal!  Ha ha!&quot;
&quot;But I'm a traitor too, so I'm really on your team!  I want you to cross my goal!  The points will go to your team, which is really my team!&quot;
&quot;That would be true... if I were a football player!&quot;
&quot;You mean...?&quot;
&quot;I'm actually a badminton player disguised as a double-agent football player!!&quot;
&quot;And I'm actually a volleyball-croquet-polo player!&quot;
&quot;Sooner or later, all our games turn into CalvinBall.&quot;
&quot;No cheating!" -- Bill Watterson]]>
