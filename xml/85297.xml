		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Having a sister or a friend is like sitting at night in a lighted house. Those outside can watch you if they want, but you need not see them. You simply say, &quot;Here are the perimeters of our attention. If you prowl around under the windows till the crickets go silent, we will pull the shades. If you wish us to suffer your envious curiosity, you must permit us not to notice it.&quot; Anyone with one solid human bond is that smug, and it is the smugness as much as the comfort and safety that lonely people covet and admire." -- Marilynne Robinson]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["That wind! ...it called to mind the small, scarce, stemmy flowers that she and Edmund would walk half a day to pick, though in another day they would all be wilted. Sometimes Edmund would carry buckets and a trowel, and lift them earth and all, and bring them home to plant, and they would die. They were rare things, and grew out of ants' nests and bear dung and the flesh of perished animals." -- Marilynne Robinson]]>
