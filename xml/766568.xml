	    <![CDATA["Even the most ardent environmentalist doesn't really want to stop pollution.  If he thinks about it, and doesn't just talk about it, he wants to have the &lt;i&gt; right amount &lt;/i&gt; of pollution.  We can't really &lt;i&gt; afford &lt;/i&gt; to eliminate it - not without abandoning all the benefits of technology that we not only enjoy but on which we depend." -- Milton Friedman]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Belief isn't simply a thing for fair times and bright days...What is belief - what is faith - if you don't continue in it after failure?...Anyone can believe in someone, or something that always succeeds...But failure...ah, now, that is hard to believe in, certainly and truly. Difficult enough to have value. Sometimes we just have to wait long enough...then we find out why exactly it was that we kept believing...There's always another secret." -- Brandon Sanderson]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["One cannot seperate truth from actions...Physically inevitable or not, truth stands above all things. It is independant of who has the best army, who can deliver the longest sermons, or even who has the most priests. It can be pushed down, but it will always surface. Truth is the one thing you can never intimidate." -- Brandon Sanderson]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Words! Mere words! How terrible they were! How clear, and vivid, and cruel! One could not escape from them. And yet what a subtle magic there was in them! They seemed to be able to give a plastic form to formless things, and to have a music of their own as sweet as that of viol or of lute. Mere words! Was there anything so real as words?" -- Oscar Wilde]]>
