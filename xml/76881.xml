	    <![CDATA["This short watch that is about to come, or rather these two short watches--why are they called &lt;i&gt;dog&lt;/i&gt; watches? Where, heu, heu, is the &lt;i&gt;canine&lt;/i&gt; connection?'

Why,' said Stephen, 'it is because they are curtailed of course." -- Patrick O'Brian]]>

	    <![CDATA["There are some good things to be said about walking. Not many, but some. Walking takes longer, for example, than any other known form of locomotion except crawling. Thus it stretches time and prolongs life. Life is already too short to waste on speed. I have a friend who's always in a hurry; he never gets anywhere. Walking makes the world much bigger and thus more interesting. You have time to observe the details. The utopian technologists foresee a future for us in which distance is annihilated. â€¦ To be everywhere at once is to be nowhere forever, if you ask me." -- Edward Abbey]]>
