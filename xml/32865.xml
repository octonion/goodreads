		<description>
	    <![CDATA["If I acknowledge my dependency, I do so because for me it is a means of signifying my demand: in the realm of love, futility is not a &quot;weakness&quot; or an &quot;absurdity&quot;: it is a strong sign: the more futile, the more it signifies and the more it asserts itself as strength.)" -- Roland Barthes]]>

	    <![CDATA["I love you so much I’ll never be able to tell you; I’m frightened to tell you. I can always feel your heart. Dance tunes are always right: I love you body and soul: —and I suppose body means that I want to touch you and be in bed with you, and i suppose soul means that i can hear you and see you and love you in every single, single thing in the whole world asleep or awake" -- Dylan Thomas]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["You know, they straightened out the Mississippi River in places, to make room for hourse and livable acreage.  Occasionally the river floods these places.  &quot;Floods&quot; is the word they use, but in fact it is not flooding; it is remembering.  Remembering where it used to be.  All water has a perfect memory and is forever trying to get back to where it was.  Writers are like that: remembering where we were, that valley we ran through, what the banks were like, the light that was there and the route back to our original place.  It is emotional memory--what the nerves and the skin remember as well as how it appeared.  And a rush of imagination is our &quot;flooding." -- Toni Morrison]]>

	    <![CDATA["And this I believe: that the free, exploring mind of the individual human is the most valuable thing in the world. And this I would fight for: the freedom of the mind to take any direction it wishes, undirected. And this I must fight against: any idea, religion, or government which limits or destroys the individual. This is what I am and what I am about." -- John Steinbeck]]>
