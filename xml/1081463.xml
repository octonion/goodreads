	    <![CDATA["He has achieved success who has lived well, laughed often, and loved much;
Who has enjoyed the trust of pure women, the respect of intelligent men and the love of little children;
Who has filled his niche and accomplished his task;
Who has never lacked appreciation of Earth's beauty or failed to express it;
Who has left the world better than he found it,
Whether an improved poppy, a perfect poem, or a rescued soul;
Who has always looked for the best in others and given them the best he had;
Whose life was an inspiration;
Whose memory a benediction." -- Bessie Anderson Stanley]]>

	    <![CDATA["If you take a book with you on a journey,&quot; Mo had said when he put the first one in her box, &quot;an odd thing happens: The book begins collecting your memories. And forever after you have only to open that book to be back where you first read it. It will all come into your mind with the very first words: the sights you saw in that place, what it smelled like, the ice cream you ate while you were reading it... yes, books are like flypaper—memories cling to the printed page better than anything else." -- Cornelia Funke]]>

	    <![CDATA["I can't forget things, or ignore them-bad things that happen,&quot; I said. &quot;I'm a lay-it-all-out person, a dwell-on-it person, an obsess-about-it person. If I hold things in and try to forget or pretend, I become a madman and have panic attacks. I have to talk." -- E. Lockhart]]>

	    <![CDATA["If I had a camera,&quot; I said, &quot;I'd take a picture of you every day. That way I'd remember how you looked every single day of your life.&quot; 

&quot;I look exactly the same.&quot; 

&quot;No, you don't. You're changing all the time. Every day a tiny bit. If I could, I'd keep a record of it all.&quot;

&quot;If you're so smart, how did I change today?&quot;

&quot;You got a fraction of a millimeter taller, for one thing. Your hair grew a fraction of a millimeter longer. And your breasts grew a fraction of a—&quot; 

&quot;They did not!&quot; 

&quot;Yes, they did.&quot;

&quot;Did NOT.&quot;

&quot;Did too.&quot; 

&quot;What else, you big pig?&quot;

&quot;You got a little happier and also a little sadder.&quot;

&quot;Meaning they cancel out each other, leaving me exactly the same.&quot;

&quot;Not at all. The fact that you got a little happier today doesn't change the fact that you also become a little sadder. Every day you become a little more of both, which means that right now, at this exact moment, you're the happiest and the saddest you've ever been in your whole life.&quot;

&quot;How do you know?&quot;

&quot;Think about it. Have you ever been happier or sadder than right now, lying here in this grass?&quot;

&quot;I guess not. No.&quot;

&quot;And have you ever been sadder?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot;

&quot;It isn't like that for everyone, you know. Some people[...]&quot; 

&quot;What about you? Are you the happiest and saddest right now that you've ever 
been?&quot;

&quot;Of course I am.&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot;

&quot;Because nothing makes me happier and nothing makes me sadder than you." -- Nicole Krauss]]>
