	    <![CDATA["It was suicide, wasn't it?&quot;
&quot;In an involuntary sort of way,&quot; said Vorob'yev. &quot;These Cetagandan political suicides can get awfully messy, when the principal won't cooperate.&quot;
&quot;Thirty-two stab wounds in the back, worst case of suicide they ever saw?&quot; murmured Ivan, clearly fascinated by the gossip.
&quot;Exactly, my lord." -- Lois McMaster Bujold]]>

	    <![CDATA["The real unforgivable acts are committed by calm men in beautiful green silk rooms, who deal death wholesale, by the shipload, without lust, without anger, or desire, or any redeeming emotion to excuse them but cold fear of some pretended future.

But the crimes they hope to prevent in that future are imaginary. The ones they commit in the present - they are real." -- Lois McMaster Bujold]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Welcome to Barrayar, son. Here you go: have a world of wealth and poverty, wrenching change and rooted history. Have a birth; have two. Have a name. Miles means &quot;soldier,&quot; but don't let the power of suggestion overwhelm you. Have a twisted form in a society that loathes and fears the mutations that have been its deepest agony. Have a title, wealth, power, and all the hatred and envy they will draw. Have your body ripped apart and re-arranged. Inherit an array of friends and enemies you never made. Have a grandfather from hell. Endure pain, find joy, and make your own meaning, because the universe certainly isn't going to supply it. Always be a moving target. Live. Live. Live." -- Lois McMaster Bujold]]>

	    <![CDATA["Apologizing to me again, thought Miles miserably. For me. He keeps telling me I'm all right—and then apologizing. Inconsistent, Father.He shuffled back and forth across the room again, and his pain burst into speech. He flung his words against the deaf door, &quot;I'll make you take back that apology! I am all right, damn it! I'll make you see it. I'll stuff you so full of pride in me there'll be no room left for your precious guilt! I swear by my word as Vorkosigan. I swear it, Father,&quot; his voice fell to a whisper, &quot;Grandfather. Somehow, I don't know how . . ." -- Lois McMaster Bujold]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Drveće spada u nešto najfinije što znam.
Voda i drveće i devojke.
Imao sam običaj da se penjem po čitav dan. I često sam
samo sedeo mirno, na vrh nekog drveta. Više sati. Kada je 
krošnja leti bila gusta, niko nije mogao da me vidi. Ja sam
mogao da vidim sve, ali mene niko nije video.
Osećao sam da sam daleko odatle. I kada bih se spustio, 
bilo je to kao doći kući posle dugog putovanja.
I pravio sam ljuljaške. Bio sam super u pravljenju ljuljaški.
Popeo bih se visoko i čvrsto vezao konopac za neku granu.
Onda bih se ljuljao.
I pljuvao. Uvek je bilo tako lepo pljuvati dok sam se ljuljao.
Ako sam pio mleko, pljuvačka je bila gusta i dobra.
Sa ljuljaške sam dobacivao mlečnu pljuvačku neverovatno
daleko.
Ponovo bih hteo da počnem da se ljuljam.
Sledeći put kad budem imao para, otići ću u sportsku radnju,
kupiću pedeset metara konopca za penjanje, a onda ću naći
neko veliko drvo,najbolje uz vodu i napraviću ljuljašku sa 
moćnom amplitudom i možda ću skočiti sa ljuljaške u vodu.
Dok Lise gleda.
Radujem se tome." -- Erlend Loe]]>

When they get blind-drunk, cheat, steal, beat their wives, starve an old woman, when they kill a trapped fox with an axe or riddle the last existing unicorn with arrows, they like to think that the Bane entering cottages at daybreak is more monstrous than they are. They feel better then. They find it easier to live." -- Andrzej Sapkowski]]>

	    <![CDATA["The possibility of incorrect results in the presence of unlucky timing is so important in concurrent programming that it has a name: a race condition. A race condition occurs when the correctness of a computation depends on the relative timing or interleaving of multiple threads by the runtime; in other words, when getting the right answer relies on lucky timing." -- Brian Goetz]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Compound actions on shared state, such as incrementing a hit counter (read-modify-write) or lazy initialization (check-then-act), must be made atomic to avoid race conditions. Holding a lock for the entire duration of a compound action can make that compound action atomic. However, just wrapping the compound action with a synchronized block is not sufficient; if synchronization is used to coordinate access to a variable, it is needed everywhere that variable is accessed. Further, when using locks to coordinate access to a variable, the same lock must be used wherever that variable is accessed." -- Brian Goetz]]>

	    <![CDATA["When a field is declared volatile, the compiler and runtime are put on notice that this variable is shared and that operations on it should not be reordered with other memory operations. Volatile variables are not cached in registers or in caches where they are hidden from other processors, so a read of a volatile variable always returns the most recent write by any thread." -- Brian Goetz]]>
