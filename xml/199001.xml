		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I would argue that it is not human fecundity that is overcrowding the world so much as the technological multipliers of the power of individual humans. The worst disease of the world now is probably the ideology of technological heroism, according to which more and more people willingly cause large-scale effects that they do not see and that they cannot control. This is the ideology of the professional class of the industrial nationsâ€”a class whose allegiance to communities and places has been dissolved by their economic motives and by their educations. These are people who will go anywhere and jeopardize anything in order to assure the success of their careers." -- Wendell Berry]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The paramount doctrine of the economic and technological euphoria of recent decades has been that everything depends on innovation.  It was understood as desirable, and even necessary, that we should go on and on from one technological innovation to the next, which would cause the economy to &quot;grow&quot; and make everything better and better.  This of course implied at every point a hatred of the past, of all things inherited and free.  All things superceded in our progress of innovations, whatever their value might have been, were discounted as of no value at all." -- Wendell Berry]]>
