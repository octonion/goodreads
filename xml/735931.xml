		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Fear is good.  Like self-doubt, fear is an indicator.  Fear tells us what we have to do.  

Remember our rule of thumb: The more scared we are of a work or calling, the more sure we can be that we have to do it.  

Resistance is experienced as fear; the degree of fear equates to the strength of Resistance.  Therefore the more fear we feel about a specific enterprise, the more certain we can be that that enterprise is important to us and to the growth of our soul.  That's why we feel so much Resistance.  If it meant nothing to us, there'd be no Resistance." -- Steven Pressfield]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["We fear discovering that we are more than we think we are. More than our parents/children/teachers think we are. We fear that we actually possess the talent that our still, small voice tells us. That we actually have the guts, the perseverance, the capacity. We fear that we truly can steer our ship, plant our flag, reach our Promised Land. We fear this because, if it’s true, then we become estranged from all we know. We pass through a membrane. We become monsters and monstrous." -- Steven Pressfield]]>
