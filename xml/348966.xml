	    <![CDATA["As for literary criticism in general: I have long felt that any reviewer who expresses rage and loathing for a novel or a play or a poem is preposterous. He or she is like a person who has put on full armor and attacked a hot fudge sundae or a banana split." -- kurt Vonnegut]]>

	    <![CDATA["A man's bookseller should keep his confidence, like his physician. What can become of a world where every man knows what another man reads?  Why, sir, books would become like quacks' potions, with every mountebank in the newspapers claiming one volume's superiority over another." -- Philip Kerr]]>

	    <![CDATA["It is now 55 years since my last book report, which is a long time to live with a guilty conscience.  So here it is: In the spring of 1956 I wrote a highly favorable review of the Bible without reading a word of it, and it was the last A I ever got in English.  Why it has taken so long to come clean I'm not sure, except I have always been extremely sensitive about my academic reputation." -- Pete Dexter]]>
