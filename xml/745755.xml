	    <![CDATA["Life was a swarm of accidents waiting in the treetops, descending upon any living thing that passed, ready to eat them alive.  You swam in a river of chance and coincidence.  You clung to the happiest accidents- the rest you let float by." -- David Wroblewski]]>

	    <![CDATA["At every single moment, the whole creation is beginning again, stretching the tent of the present moment to bursting.  And the waves that push up through the oceans, and the waves that push up through the stars; and the waves that push upwards through history are the same waves that push up through us.  And so we have to say yes to time, even though it means speeding forward into memory; forgetfulness; and oblivion.  Say “no” to time; hold on to what you were or what she was; hold onto the past, even out of love... and I swear it will tear you to shreds.  This universe will tear you to shreds." -- Craig Wright]]>
