		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Outside the youth center, between the liquor store
and the police station,
a little dogwood tree is losing its mind;

overflowing with blossomfoam,
like a sudsy mug of beer;
like a bride ripping off her clothes,

dropping snow white petals to the ground in clouds,

so Nature’s wastefulness seems quietly obscene.
It’s been doing that all week:
making beauty,
and throwing it away,
and making more." -- Tony Hoagland]]>

	    <![CDATA["What I saw was more than I could stand.  The noise I heard had been made by Little Ann.  All her life she had slept by Old Dan's side.  And although he was dead, she had left the doghouse, had come back to the porch, and snuggled up by his side." -- Wilson Rawls]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["After the last shovel of dirt was patted in place, I sat down and let my mind drift back through the years. I thought of the old K. C. Baking Powder can, and the first time I saw my pups in the box at the depot. I thought of the fifty dollars, the nickels and dimes, and the fishermen and blackberry patches.

I looked at his grave and, with tears in my eyes, I voiced these words: &quot;You were worth it, old friend, and a thousand times over." -- Wilson Rawls]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I am carrying the whimper 
you can hear when the mouth is collapsed, the wisdom 
of monkeys. Ask a glass of water why it pities 
the rain. Ask the lunatic yard dog why it tolerates the leash. 
Brothers and sisters, when you spend your nights 
out on a limb, there’s a chance you’ll fall in your sleep." -- Terrance Hayes]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Into this wild Abyss/ The womb of Nature, and perhaps her grave--/ Of neither sea, nor shore, nor air, nor fire,/ But all these in their pregnant causes mixed/ Confusedly, and which thus must ever fight,/ Unless the Almighty Maker them ordain/ His dark materials to create more worlds,--/ Into this wild Abyss the wary Fiend/ Stood on the brink of Hell and looked a while,/ Pondering his voyage; for no narrow frith/ He had to cross. " -- John Milton]]>
