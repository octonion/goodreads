	    <![CDATA["The only nineties performer I see worthy of wearing the Bee Gees mantle of grandiose love hurried on by an eternal wind is Seal. Seal informs the lady that she is &quot;the light on the dark side of me.&quot; He goes on: &quot;And did you know that when it snows my eyes become enlarged and the light that you shine can't be seen?&quot; Well, no, I didn't know that. As with the Bee Gees, I'm not sure what Seal is trying to say, but it sounds so traumatic and interesting that I immediately imagine the song is about me. &quot;You remain my power, my pleasure, my pain,&quot; Seal is telling me. I like to be talked to like that! I can't wait for his next album to come out so I can find out what else I am." -- Lisa Carver]]>
