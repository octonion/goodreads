	    <![CDATA["Life is truly a ride.  We're all strapped in and no one can stop it.  When the doctor slaps your behind, he's ripping your ticket and away you go.  As you make each passage from youth to adulthood to maturity, sometimes you put your arms up and scream, sometimes you just hang on to that bar in front of you.  But the ride is the thing.  I think the most you can hope for at the end of life is that your hair's messed, you're out of breath, and you didn't throw up." -- Jerry Seinfeld]]>
