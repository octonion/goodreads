	    <![CDATA["Driving to class with him. All I could
think about was
that it had been
three days
since I'd touched
his face
AND HE
SEEMED
so fine.

I said, to him &quot;you seem like you didn't miss a beat.&quot;

He looked at me
and said
Sabrina, I've missed
so many beats, I've
MADE A RhytHM." -- Sabrina Ward Harrison]]>
