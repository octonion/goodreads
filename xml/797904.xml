	    <![CDATA["I may say that this is the greatest factor: the way in which the expedition is equipped, the way in which every difficulty is foreseen, and precautions taken for meeting or avoiding it.

Defeat is certain for him who has neglected to take the necessary precautions in time, this is called bad luck." -- Roald Amundsen]]>
