	    <![CDATA["We're so self-important. So arrogant. Everybody's going to save something now. Save the trees, save the bees, save the whales, save the snails. And the supreme arrogance? Save the planet! Are these people kidding? Save the planet? We don't even know how to take care of ourselves; we haven't learned how to care for one another. We're gonna save the fuckin' planet? . . . And, by the way, there's nothing wrong with the planet in the first place. The planet is fine. The people are fucked! Compared with the people, the planet is doin' great. It's been here over four billion years . . . The planet isn't goin' anywhere, folks. We are! We're goin' away. Pack your shit, we're goin' away. And we won't leave much of a trace. Thank God for that. Nothing left. Maybe a little Styrofoam. The planet will be here, and we'll be gone. Another failed mutation; another closed-end biological mistake." -- George Carlin]]>

	    <![CDATA["Atticus, you must be wrong.&quot; 

&quot;How's that?&quot; 

&quot;Well, most folks seem to think they're right and you're wrong. . .&quot; 

&quot;They're certainly entitled to think that, and they're entitled to full respect for their opinions,&quot; said Atticus, &quot;but before I can live with other folks I've got to live with myself. The one thing that doesn't abide by majority rule is a person's conscience." -- Harper Lee]]>
