	    <![CDATA["I don't want you forgetting how different our circumstaces are. If you die, and I live, there's no life for me at all back in District Twelve. You're my whole life.&quot; Peeta says. &quot;I would never be happy again. It's different for you. I'm not saying it wouldn't be hard. But there are other people who'd make your life worth living.&quot;
 
&quot;No one really needs me,&quot; he says, and there's no selfpity in his voice. It's true his family doesn't need him. They will mourn him, as will a handfull of friends. But they will get on.... I realise only one person will be damaged beyond repair if Peeta dies. Me.

&quot;I do,&quot; I say. &quot;I need you." -- Suzanne Collins]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["You must live every day as if it counts, which means to love all of it. Never let a single one go by without noting the color of the sky, the song of the bird, the face of the one you love best. And don't let yourself get talked out of the things you really care about, don't put off what you want to be." -- C.A. Belmond]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["There are different wells within your heart.
Some fill with each good rain,
Others are far too deep for that.

In one well
You have just a few precious cups of water,
That &quot;love&quot; is literally something of yourself,
It can grow as slow as a diamond
If it is lost.

Your love
Should never be offered to the mouth of a
Stranger,
Only to someone
Who has the valor and daring
To cut pieces of their soul off with a knife
Then weave them into a blanket
To protect you.

There are different wells within us.
Some fill with each good rain,
Others are far, far too deep
For that." -- Hafiz]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["if one day you feel like crying...
call me 
I don't promise that
I will make you laugh

But I can cry with you.

If one day you want to run away
Don't be afraid to call me.
I don't promise to ask you to stop,

But I can run with you.

If one day you don't want to listen to anyone 
call me 
i promise to be there for you
but i also promise to remain quiet 

But...
If one day you call
and there is no answer...
come fast to see me..

Perhaps I need you." -- Robert J. Lavery]]>
