		<description>
	    <![CDATA["No live organism can continue for long to exist sanely under conditions of absolute reality; even larks and katydids are supposed, by some, to dream. Hill House, not sane, stood by itself against its hills, holding darkness within; it had stood so for eighty years and might stand for eighty more. Within, walls continued upright, bricks met neatly, floors were firm, and doors were sensibly shut; silence lay steadily against the wood and stone of Hill House, and whatever walked there, walked alone." -- Shirley Jackson]]>

	    <![CDATA["Auri hopped down from the chimney and skipped over to where I stood, her hair streaming behind her. &quot;Hello Kvothe.&quot; She took a half-step back. &quot;You reek.&quot;
I smiled my best smile of the day. &quot;Hello Auri,&quot; I said. &quot;You smell like a
pretty young girl.&quot;
&quot;I do,&quot; she agreed happily.
She stepped sideways a little, then forward again, moving lightly on the balls of her bare feet. &quot;What did you bring me?&quot; she asked.
&quot;What did you bring me?&quot; I countered.
She grinned. &quot;I have an apple that thinks it is a pear,&quot; she said, holding it up. &quot;And a bun that thinks it is a cat. And a lettuce that thinks it is a lettuce.&quot;
&quot;It's a clever lettuce then.&quot;
&quot;Hardly,&quot; she said with a delicate snort. &quot;Why would anything clever think it was a lettuce?&quot;
&quot;Even if it is a lettuce?&quot; I asked.
&quot;Especially then,&quot; she said. &quot;Bad enough to be a lettuce. How awful to think you are a lettuce too.&quot; She shook her head sadly, her hair following the motion as if she were underwater.
I unwrapped my bundle. &quot;I brought you some potatoes, half a squash,
and a bottle of beer that thinks it is a loaf of bread.&quot;
&quot;What does the squash think it is?&quot; she asked curiously, looking down at it. She held her hands clasped behind her back
&quot;It knows it's a squash,&quot; I said. &quot;But it's pretending to be the setting sun.&quot;
&quot;And the potatoes?&quot; she asked.
&quot;They're sleeping,&quot; I said. &quot;And cold, I'm afraid.&quot;
She looked up at me, her eyes gentle. &quot;Don't be afraid,&quot; she said, and reached out and rested her fingers on my cheek for the space of a heartbeat, her touch lighter than the stroke of a feather. &quot;I'm here. You're safe." -- Patrick Rothfuss]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Auri grew serious. “Now close your eyes and bend down so I can give you your second present.”

Puzzled, I closed my eyes and bent at the waist, wondering if she had made me a hat as well.

I felt her hands on either side of my face, then she gave me a tiny, delicate kiss in the middle of my forehead.

Surprised, I opened my eyes. But she was already standing several steps away, her hands clasped nervously behind her back. I couldn’t think of anything to say.

Auri took a step forward. “You are special to me,” she said seriously, her face grave. “I want you to know I will always take care of you.” She reached out tentatively and wiped at my cheeks. “No. None of that tonight. This is your third present. If things are bad, you can come and stay with me in the Underthing. It is nice there, and you will be safe.”

“Thank you, Auri,” I said as soon as I was able. “You are special to me, too.”

“Of course I am,” she said matter-of-factly. “I am as lovely as the moon." -- Patrick Rothfuss]]>
