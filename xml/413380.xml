		<description>
	    <![CDATA["No doubt very few people understand the purely subjective nature of the phenomenon that we call love, or how it creates, so to speak, a supplementary person, distinct from the person whom the world knows by the same name, a person most of whose constituent elements are derived from ourselves." -- Marcel Proust]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Even in the most insignificant details of our daily life, none of us can be said to constitute a material whole, which is identical for everyone, and need only be turned up like a page in an account-book or the record of a will; our social personality is created by the thoughts of other people." -- Marcel Proust]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Perhaps it is not-being that is the true state, and all our dream of life is inexistent; but, if so, we feel that these phrases of music, these conceptions which exist in relation to our dream, must be nothing either.  We shall perish, but we have as hostages these divine captives who will follow and share our fate.  And death in their company is somehow less bitter, less inglorious, perhaps even less probable. " -- Marcel Proust]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Facts do not find their way into the world in which our beliefs reside; they did not produce our beliefs, they do not destroy them; they may inflict on them the most constant refutations without weakening them, and an avalanche of afflictions or ailments succeeding one another without interruption in a family will not make it doubt the goodness of its God or the talent of its doctor." -- Marcel Proust]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The bonds between ourselves and another person exists only in our minds. Memory as it grows fainter loosens them, and notwithstanding the illusion by which we want to be duped and which, out of love, friendship, politeness, deference, duty, we dupe other people, we exist alone. Man is the creature who cannot escape from himself, who knows other people only in himself, and when he asserts the contrary, he is lying." -- Marcel Proust]]>
