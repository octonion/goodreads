		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["She was like me in lineaments-- her eyes
Her hair, her features, all, to the very tone
Even of her voice, they said were like to mine;
But soften'd all, and temper'd into beauty;
She had the same lone thoughts and wanderings,
The quest of hidden knowledge, and a mind
To comprehend the universe: nor these
Alone, but with them gentler powers than mine,
Pity, and smiles, and tears-- which I had not;
And tenderness-- but that I had for her; 
Humility-- and that I never had. 
Her faults were mine-- her virtues were her own--
I loved her, and destroy'd her!" -- George Gordon Byron]]>
