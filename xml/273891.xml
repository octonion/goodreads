		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Women intrinsically understand human dynamics, and that makes them unstoppable.  Unfortunately, the average man is less adroit at fostering such rivalries, which is why most men remain average; males are better at hating things that can't hate them back (e.g., lawnmowers, cats, the Denver Broncos, et cetera).  They don't see the big picture." -- Chuck Klosterman]]>

	    <![CDATA["Many environmental threats in the twenty-first century will coincide with the dying out of the post-World War II baby boomers.  Future historians may call them the fortunate generation.  Their fortune was to have been born after the discovery of penicillin, to have lived in an age of selfish overconsumption of resources, and to have died before the oil ran out." -- Bernard Goldstein]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Still, despite all this, traveling is the great true love of my life.  I have always felt, ever since I was sixteen years old and first went to Russia with my saved-up babysitting money, that to travel is worth any cost or sacrifice.  I am loyal and constant in my love for travel, as I have not always been loyal and constant in my other loves.  I feel about travel the way a happy new mother feels about her impossible, colicky, restless, newborn baby--I just don't care what it puts me through.  Because I adore it.  Because it's mine.  Because it looks exactly like me.  It can barf all over me if it wants to--I just don't care." -- Elizabeth Gilbert]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Happiness is the consequence of personal effort.  You fight for it, strive for it, insist upon it, and sometimes even travel around the world looking for it.  You have to participate relentlessly in the manifestations of your own blessings.  And once you have achieved a state of happiness, you must never become lax about maintaining it.  You must make a mighty effort to keep swimming upward into that happiness forever, to stay afloat on top of it." -- Elizabeth Gilbert]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["On my fifth trip to France I limited myself to the words and phrases that people actually use. From the dog owners I learned &quot;Lie down,&quot; &quot;Shut up,&quot; and &quot;Who shit on this carpet?&quot; The couple across the road taught me to ask questions correctly, and the grocer taught me to count. Things began to come together, and I went from speaking like an evil baby to speaking like a hillbilly. &quot;Is thems the thoughts of cows?&quot; I'd ask the butcher, pointing to the calves' brains displayed in the front window. &quot;I want me some lamb chop with handles on 'em." -- David Sedaris]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["My friend Jim Richardson, a National Geographic photojournalist, likes to make the distinction between being a &quot;traveler&quot; and a &quot;sightseer.&quot;  According to Jim, a traveler seeks engagements with the local people and culture, while the sightseer just clicks off sights in the guidebook, a &quot;been there, done that&quot; mentality.  A sightseeing photographer stands apart from the culture and &quot;steals&quot; pictures from a distance, while a travel photographer becomes involved with his or her surroundings and the people, and the resulting pictures become more intimate." -- Bob Krist]]>

And what's coming your way is unlikely to be a breeze or a cow or a coconut, but a new kind of screen you can zap or click to create the illusion that life isn't passing you by." -- Susan Neiman]]>

	    <![CDATA["Kitsch is much more than a question of style; it's a preference for consolation over truth.  Disney's version of reality is not just cleaned up, it's pernicious.  Unlike the best forms of art and philosophy, it undercuts the possibility of transformation because it portrays a world that's just fine as it is--or as it will be by the time the credits come up." -- Susan Neiman]]>
