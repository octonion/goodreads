	    <![CDATA["I will find you,&quot; he whispered in my ear.  &quot;I promise.  If I must endure two hundred years of purgatory, two hundred years without you - then that is my punishment, which I have earned for my crimes.  For I have lied, and killed, and stolen; betrayed and broken trust.  But there is the one thing that shall lie in the balance.  When I shall stand before God, I shall have one thing to say, to weigh against the rest.&quot;

His voice dropped, nearly to a whisper, and his arms tightened around me.

Lord, ye gave me a rare woman, and God!  I loved her well." -- Diana Gabaldon]]>
