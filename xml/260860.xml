		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I wasn't born with any innate talent.  I've never been naturally gifted at anything.  I always had to work at it.  The only way I knew how to succeed was to try harder than anyone else.  Dogged persistence is what got me through life.  But here was something I was half-decent at.  Being able to run great distances was the one thing I could offer the world.  Others might be faster, but I could go longer.  My strongest quality is that I never give up." -- Dean Karnazes]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Most people never get there.  They're afraid or unwilling to demand enough of themselves and take the easy road, the path of least resistance.  But struggling and suffering, as I now saw it, were the essence of a life worth living.  If you're not pushing yourself beyond the comfort zone, if you're not constantly demanding more from yourself--expanding and learning as you go--your choosing a numb existence.  Your denying yourself an extraordinary trip." -- Dean Karnazes]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["...It would hardly be a waste of time if sometimes even the most advanced students in the cognitive sciences were to pay a visit to their ancestors. It is frequently claimed in American philosophy departments that, in order to be a philosopher, it is not necessary to revisit the history of philosophy. It is like the claim that one can become a painter without having ever seen a single work by Raphael, or a writer without having ever read the classics. Such things are theoretically possible; but the 'primitive' artist, condemned to an ignorance of the past, is always recognizable as such and rightly labeled as naïf. It is only when we consider past projects revealed as utopian or as failures that we are apprised of the dangers and possibilities for failure for our allegedly new projects. The study of the deeds of our ancestors is thus more than an atiquarian pastime, it is an immunological precaution." -- Umberto Eco]]>
