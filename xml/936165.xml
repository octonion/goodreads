She is part of keeping us on earthnot the &quot;us&quot; comprised of individuals but the species itself. By protecting this one baby this gift a mother accepts life's clearest responsibility." -- Gavin de Becker]]>

	    <![CDATA["When dreaded outcomes are actually imminent we don't worry about themwe take action. Seeing lava from the local volcano make its way down the street toward our house does not cause worry it causes running. Also we don't usually choose imminent events as subjects for our worrying and thus emerges an ironic truth: Often the very fact that you are worrying about something means that it isn't likely to happen." -- Gavin de Becker]]>
