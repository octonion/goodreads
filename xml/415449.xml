	    <![CDATA["She often spoke to falling seeds and said, &quot;Ah hope you fall on soft ground,&quot; because she had heard seeds saying that to each other as they passed. The familiar people and things had failed her so she hung over the gate and looked up the road towards way off. She knew now that marriage did not make love. Janie's first dream was dead, so she became a woman." -- Zora Neale Hurston]]>

	    <![CDATA["I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story. From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was Ee Gee, the amazing editor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another fig was Constantin and Socrates and Attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions, and another fig was an Olympic lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn't quite make out. I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet." -- Sylvia Plath]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Passion makes a person stop eating, sleeping, working, feeling at peace. A lot of people are frightened because, when it appears, it demolishes all the old things it finds in its path. 

No one wants their life thrown into chaos. That is why a lot of people keep that threat under control, and are somehow capable of sustaining a house or a structure that is already rotten. They are the engineers of the superseded. 

Other people think exactly the opposite: they surrender themselves without a second thought, hoping to find in passion the solutions to all their problems. They make the other person responsible for their happiness and blame them for their possible unhappiness. They are either euphoric because something marvelous has happened or depressed because something unexpected has just ruined everything. 

Keeping passion at bay or surrendering blindly to it - which of these two attitudes is the least destructive? 

I don't know." -- Paulo Coelho]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["make a radical change in your lifestyle and begin to boldly do things which you may previously never have thought of doing, or been too hesitant to attempt. So many people live within unhappy circumstances and yet will not take the initiative to change their situation because they are conditioned to a life of security, conformity, and conservation, all of which may appear to give one peace of mind, but in reality nothing is more damaging to the adventurous spirit within a man than a secure future. The very basic core of a man's living spirit is his passion for adventure. The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences, and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new and different sun. If you want to get more out of life, you must lose your inclination for monotonous security and adopt a helter-skelter style of life that will at first appear to you to be crazy. But once you become accustomed to such a life you will see its full meaning and its incredible beauty." -- Jon Krakauer]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Go placidly amid the noise and the haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence. As far as possible without surrender, be on good terms with all persons. Speak your truth quietly and clearly, and listen to others, even the dull and ignorant; they too have their story. Be yourself. Especially do not feign affection. Neither be cynical about love â€“ for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment is it perennial as the grass. Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth. Nurture strength of spirit to shield you from misfortune. But do not distress yourself with imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. You are a child of the universe no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be, and whatever your labours and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul. With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world." -- Max Ehrmann]]>

	    <![CDATA["ROSE of all Roses, Rose of all the World!	
The tall thought-woven sails, that flap unfurled	
Above the tide of hours, trouble the air,	
And Godâ€™s bell buoyed to be the waterâ€™s care;	
While hushed from fear, or loud with hope, a band	        
With blown, spray-dabbled hair gather at hand.	
Turn if you may from battles never done,	
I call, as they go by me one by one,	
Danger no refuge holds, and war no peace,	
For him who hears love sing and never cease,	       
Beside her clean-swept hearth, her quiet shade:	
But gather all for whom no love hath made	
A woven silence, or but came to cast	
A song into the air, and singing past	
To smile on the pale dawn; and gather you	       
Who have sought more than is in rain or dew	
Or in the sun and moon, or on the earth,	
Or sighs amid the wandering starry mirth,	
Or comes in laughter from the seaâ€™s sad lips;	
And wage Godâ€™s battles in the long grey ships.	       
The sad, the lonely, the insatiable,	
To these Old Night shall all her mystery tell;	
Godâ€™s bell has claimed them by the little cry	
Of their sad hearts, that may not live nor die.	
 
Rose of all Roses, Rose of all the World!	     
You, too, have come where the dim tides are hurled	
Upon the wharves of sorrow, and heard ring	
The bell that calls us on; the sweet far thing.	
Beauty grown sad with its eternity	
Made you of us, and of the dim grey sea.	
Our long ships loose thought-woven sails and wait,	
For God has bid them share an equal fate;	
And when at last defeated in His wars,	
They have gone down under the same white stars,	
We shall no longer hear the little cry	       
Of our sad hearts, that may not live nor die.

The Sweet Far Thing" -- William Butler Yeats]]>

	    <![CDATA["Furthermore, we have not even to risk the adventure alone; for the heroes of all time have gone before us, the labyrinth is fully known; we have only to follow the thread of the hero-path.  And where we had thought to find an abomination, we shall find a god; where we had thought to slay another, we shall slay ourselves; where we had thought to travel outward, we shall come to the center of our own existence; where we had thought to be alone, we shall be with all the world." -- Joseph Campbell]]>
