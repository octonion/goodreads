	    <![CDATA["Taylor and Niall are watching their personal assistant prospects waiting to be interviewed.
&quot;Leave them sitting there until one of them shows some initiative.&quot; Niall said.
Ten minutes ticked slowly by.
&quot;I give in,&quot; Niall said.  &quot;They're all idiots.&quot;
Taylor laughed.  &quot;I'm intrigued now.  How long are they going to sit there?&quot;
&quot;I suspect until they drop dead.&quot;
Five more minutes before Taylor heard Niall exhale in frustration, and then the door of the living room flew open and a chicken burst in.
&quot;What the f**k?&quot; Taylor gasped.
&quot;Hi, everyone,&quot; the chicken said in a perky voice.  &quot;Thank goodness, I'm not too late.  I had difficulty getting across the road.&quot;  She laughed and then sighed when no one else joined in.  They sat staring at her in mute shock." -- Barbara Elsborg]]>

	    <![CDATA["Why didn't you call?&quot; Taylor asked.
&quot;I did. No one answered.&quot; Roo bent to refill her handbag.
&lt;i&gt;Ah.&lt;/i&gt; &quot;So how were going to get in the house?&quot;
&quot;I thought I'd just wait for you to come back.&quot;  She started to tap her foot.
&quot;Why didn't you go home and call a locksmith?&quot; Taylor asked.
Roo glared.  &quot;What is this?  The Spanish Inquisition?&quot;  Then she grinned.  &quot;Oh, I've waited years to say that.&quot;
Taylor bit back his laugh." -- Barbara Elsborg]]>

Roo pressed her lips together and then sighed.  &quot;How long do you want me to think?&quot;
Niall let out a snort of laughter." -- Barbara Elsborg]]>
