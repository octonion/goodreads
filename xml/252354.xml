	    <![CDATA["Meghan pushed her chocolate cheesecake across the table to me. I hadn’t gotten paid yet for November, so I had only ordered coffee. “Here,” she said.

“Don’t you want it?”

“Sure I want it. I ordered it. But I’m giving it to you.”

“Why?”

Meghan stood up and got me a fork. “Remember what Nora said about love? In your movie?”

“Love is when you have a really amazing piece of cake, and it’s the very last piece, but you let him have it,” I said.

“So it’s really amazing cake,” said Meghan. “And I want you to have it." -- E. Lockhart]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["What’s with her?” says the painter. 

 “She’s mad because she’s a woman,” Jon says. This is something I haven’t heard for years, not since high school. Once it was a shaming thing to say, and crushing to have it said about you, by a man. It implied oddness, deformity, sexual malfunction. 

 I go to the living room doorway. “I’m not mad because I’m a woman,” I say. “I’m mad because you’re an asshole." -- Margaret Atwood]]>

Napped on the sofa for an hour, then demanded to be let out. It turned into a nightly ritual, with him staying longer and longer, until at some point I realized he'd moved in. He's basically the most brazen squatter ever." -- Tammara Webber]]>

I just mean that I wasn't, you know...displaying it while I was at Starbucks.  That's probably understood, but I thought I should clarify, since it's the first chapter and you don't know that much about me. So just to clarify, I always have my vagina with me.  It's like my American Express card.  (In that I don't leave home without it.  Not that I use it to buy stuff with.)" -- Jenny Lawson]]>

Your arm could have a bone jutting out, and you would still try to laugh it off as if everything were hunky dory. &lt;i&gt;This compound fracture? It's nothing! I like to let my bones out of my body once in a while for fresh air. It's good for them.&lt;/i&gt;" -- Eileen Cook]]>

	    <![CDATA["The belief that unhappiness is selfless and happiness is selfish is misguided.  It's more selfless to act happy.  It takes energy, generosity, and discipline to be unfailingly lighthearted, yet everyone takes the happy person for granted.  No one is careful of his feelings or tries to keep his spirits high. He seems self-sufficient; he becomes a cushion for others.  And because happiness seems unforced, that person usually gets no credit." -- Gretchen Rubin]]>

And while fighting for your right to lap dance and mime and breathe just regular pollution is a very fine, very American idea, it is not quite as brave as being  middle-aged black woman in Alabama in 1955 telling a white man she's not giving him her seat despite the fact that the law requires her to do so." -- Sarah Vowell]]>
