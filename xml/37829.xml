		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Every adult life could be said to be defined by two great love stories. The first—the story of our quest for sexual love—is well known and well charted, its vagaries form the staple of music and literature, it is socially accepted and celebrated. The second—the story of our quest for love from the world—is a more secret and shameful tale." -- Alain de Botton]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["When I see the blind and wretched state of men, when I survey the whole universe in its deadness, and man left to himself with no light, as though lost in this corner of the universe without knowing who put him there, what he has to do, or what will become of him when he dies, incapable of knowing anything, I am moved to terror, like a man transported in his sleep to some terrifying desert island, who wakes up quite lost, with no means of escape.  Then I marvel that so wretched a state does not drive people to despair." -- Blaise Pascal]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["To draw an analogy: a man's suffering is similar to the behavior of a gas.  If a certain quantity of gas is pumped into an empty chamber, it will fill the chamber completely and evenly, no matter how big the chamber.  Thus suffering completely fills the human soul and conscious mind, no matter whether the suffering is great or little.  Therefore the &quot;size&quot; of human suffering is absolutely relative." -- Viktor Emil Frankl]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["As soon as we are alone,...inner chaos opens up in us.  This chaos can be so disturbing and so confusing that we can hardly wait to get busy again.  Entering a private room and shutting the door, therefore, does not mean that we immediatel;y shut ou all our iner doubts, anxieities, fears, bad memories, unresolved conflicts, angry feelings and impulsive desires.  On the contrary, when we have removed our outer distraction, we often find that our inner distraction manifest themselves to us in full force.  We often use the outer distractions to shield ourselves from the interior noises.  This makes the discipline of solitude all the more important." -- Henri J.M. Nouwen]]>
