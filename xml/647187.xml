	    <![CDATA["About the library,&quot; he whispered. He took out the pencil stub from his pocket and poised it over the page.

&quot;Will you write like Mr. Blake or like yourself?&quot; I inquired.

He wrote and whispered the words aloud as he did. &quot;I am in the library. It smells like old stuff.&quot;

&quot;It smells familiar,&quot; I suggested. &quot;It smells like words.&quot; Because his left side was to me, I couldn't easily take his hand to write.

&quot;Books are boring,&quot; James said as he wrote.

&quot;They line the walls like a thousand leather doorways to be opened into worlds unknown,&quot; I offered.

He thought about this and then wrote with a smile, &quot;I hate books." -- Laura Whitcomb]]>

It can be clear and bright enough to hurt your eyes, or covered in fog; hidden behind a curve of road, and then suddenly there in full glory. Its waves come like breaths, in and out, in and out, body stretched to forever in its possibilities, and yet its heart lies deep, not fully knowable, inconceivably majestic." -- Deb Caletti]]>
