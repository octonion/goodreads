	    <![CDATA["I'm nobody! Who are you?  
Are you nobody, too?  
Then there ’s a pair of us—don’t tell!  
They ’d banish us, you know.  
   
How dreary to be somebody!         
How public, like a frog  
To tell your name the livelong day  
To an admiring bog!" -- Emily Dickinson]]>

	    <![CDATA["Do you think I am an automaton? — a machine without feelings? and can bear to have my morsel of bread snatched from my lips, and my drop of living water dashed from my cup? Do you think, because I am poor, obscure, plain, and little, I am soulless and heartless? You think wrong! — I have as much soul as you — and full as much heart! And if God had gifted me with some beauty and much wealth, I should have made it as hard for you to leave me, as it is now for me to leave you. I am not talking to you now through the medium of custom, conventionalities, nor even of mortal flesh: it is my spirit that addresses your spirit; just as if both had passed through the grave, and we stood at God's feet, equal — as we are!" -- Charlotte Brontë]]>
