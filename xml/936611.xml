	    <![CDATA["Which is why we have spouses and children and parents and colleagues and friends, because someone has to know us better than we know ourselves.  We need them to tell us.  We need them to say, &quot;I know you, Al.  You are not the kind of man who." -- Richard Russo]]>

	    <![CDATA["As I drift back into sleep, I can't help thinking that it's a wonderful thing to be right about the world. To weigh the evidence, always incomplete, and correctly intuit the whole, to see the world in a grain of sand, to recognize its beauty, its simplicity, its truth.  It's as close as we get to God in this life, and reside in the glow of such brief flashes of understanding, fully awake, sometimes for two or three seconds, at peace with our existence. And then back to sleep we go." -- Richard Russo]]>
