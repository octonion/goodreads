I said 'Lord, if I've never had courage in my life before, let me have it now. Let me be brave enough not to fall on my knees and beg her to stay.' He pulled his eyes away from the cottage and smiled briefly at me. 
Hardest thing I ever did, Sassenach." -- Diana Gabaldon]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["History was not a matter of missing minutes on the tape. I did not stand helpless before it. I hewed to the texture of collected knowledge, took faith from the solid and availing stuff of our experience. Even if we believe that history is a workwheel powered by human blood -- read the speeches of Mussolini -- at least we've known the thing together. A single narrative sweep, not ten thousand wisps of disinformation. (82)" -- Don DeLillo]]>

The power of numbers is never more evident than when we use them to speculate on the time of our dying." -- Don DeLillo]]>
