		<description>
	    <![CDATA["My grandmother's greatest gift was tolerance.  Now, in the old days, Indians used to be forgiving of any kind of eccentricity.  In fact, weird people were often celebrated.  Epileptics were often shamans because people just assumed that God gave seizure-visions to the lucky ones.  Gay people were seen as magical too.  I mean, like in many cultures, men were viewed as warriors and women were viewed as caregivers.  But gay people, being both male and female, were seen as both warriors and caregivers.  Gay people could do anything.  They were like Swiss Army knives!  My grandmother had no use for all the gay bashing and homophobia in the world, especially among other Indians.  &quot;Jeez,&quot; she said, Who cares if a man wants to marry another man?  All I want to know is who's going to pick up all the dirty socks?&quot; (155)" -- Sherman Alexie]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["There are only two kinds of men in this world: Honest men and dishonest men. ...Any man who says the world owes him a living is dishonest. The same God that made you and me made this earth. And He planned it so that it would yield every single thing that the people on it need. But He was careful to plan it so that it would only yield up its wealth in exchange for the labor of man. Any man who tries to share in that wealth without contributing the work of his brain or his hands is dishonest." -- Ralph Moody]]>
