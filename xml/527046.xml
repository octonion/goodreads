	    <![CDATA["Vhat ozzer abilities do you haf?&quot; ter Borcht snapped, which his assistant waited, pen in hand.
Gazzy thought. &quot;I have X-ray vision,&quot; he said. He peered at ter Borcht's chest, then blinked and looked alarmed.
Ter Borcht was startled for a second, but then he frowned. &quot;Don't write dat down,&quot; he told his assistant in irritation. The assistant froze in midsentence.
&quot;You. Do you haf any qualities dat distinguish you in any way?&quot;
Nudge chewed on a fingernail. &quot;You mean, like, besides the WINGS?&quot; She shook her shoulders gently, and her beautiful fawn-colored wings unfolded a bit.
His face flushed, and I felt like cheering. &quot;Yes,&quot; he said stiffly. &quot;Besides de vings.&quot;
&quot;Hmm. Besides de vings.&quot; Nudge tapped one finger against her chin. &quot;Um...&quot; Her face brightened. &quot;I once ate nine Snickers bars in one sitting. Without barfing. That was a record!&quot;
&quot;Hardly a special talent,&quot; ter Borcht said witheringly. 
Nudge was offended. &quot;Yeah? Let's see YOU do it.&quot;
...
&quot;I vill now eat nine Snickers bars,&quot; Gazzy said in a perfect, creepy imitation of ter Borcht's voice, &quot;visout bahfing.&quot;
Iggy rubbed his forehead with one hand. &quot;Well, I have a highly developed sense of irony.&quot;
Ter Borcht tsked. &quot;You are a liability to your group. I assume you alvays hold on to someone's shirt, yes? Following dem closely?&quot;
&quot;Only when I'm trying to steal their dessert&quot;
...Fang pretended to think, gazing up at the ceiling. &quot;Besides my fashion sense? I play a mean harmonica.&quot;
&quot;I vill now destroy de Snickuhs bahrs!&quot; Gazzy barked." -- James Patterson]]>
