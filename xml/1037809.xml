ELPHABA: Lie?

GLINDA: (fiercely) Be encouraging! And what exactly have you been doing? Besides riding on around on that filthy thing!

ELPHABA: Well, we can't all come and go by bubble. Whose invention was that, the Wizard's? Of course, even if it wasn't, I'm sure he'd still take credit for it.

GLINDA: Yes, well, a lot of us are taking things that don't belong to us, aren't we?

&lt;i&gt;Uh oh! The two stare daggers at each other, then...&lt;/i&gt;

ELPHABA: Now, wait just a clock-tick. I know it's difficult for that blissful blonde brain of yours to comprehend that someone like him could actually choose someone like me!But it's happened. It's real. And you can wave that ridiculous wand all you want, you can't change it! He never belonged to you -- he doesn't love you, he never did! He loves me!" -- Stephen Schwartz]]>
