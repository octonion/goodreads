	    <![CDATA["If you were an atheist, Birbal,&quot; the Emperor challenged his first minister, &quot;what would you say to the true believers of all the great religions of the world?&quot; Birbal was a devout Brahmin from Trivikrampur, but he answered unhesitatingly, &quot;I would say to them that in my opinion they were all atheists as well; I merely believe in one god less than each of them.&quot; &quot;How so?&quot; the Emperor asked.  &quot;All true believers have good reasons for disbelieving in every god except their own,&quot; said Birbal.  &quot;And so it is they who, between them, give me all the reasons for believing in none.&quot;
