	    <![CDATA["Good. Item seven. The &lt;i&gt;had had&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;that that&lt;/i&gt; problem. Lady Cavendish, werenâ€™t you working on this?â€™ 

Lady Cavendish stood up and gathered her thoughts. â€˜Indeed. The uses of &lt;i&gt;had had&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;that that&lt;/i&gt; have to be strictly controlled; they can interrupt the imaginotransference quite dramatically, causing readers to go back over the sentence in confusion, something we try to avoid.â€™

 â€˜Go on.â€™

 â€˜Itâ€™s mostly an unlicensed-usage problem. At the last count David Copperfield alone had had &lt;i&gt;had had&lt;/i&gt; sixty three times, all but ten unapproved. Pilgrimâ€™s Progress may also be a problem due to its &lt;i&gt;had had/that that&lt;/i&gt; ratio.â€™

 â€˜So whatâ€™s the problem in Progress?â€™ 

 â€˜That that had &lt;i&gt;that that&lt;/i&gt; ten times but had had &lt;i&gt;had had&lt;/i&gt; only thrice. Increased &lt;i&gt;had had&lt;/i&gt; usage had had to be overlooked, but not if the number exceeds that &lt;i&gt;that that&lt;/i&gt; usage.â€™

 â€˜Hmm,â€™ said the Bellman, â€˜I thought &lt;i&gt;had had&lt;/i&gt; had had TGCâ€™s approval for use in Dickens? Whatâ€™s the problem?â€™ 

 â€˜Take the first &lt;i&gt;had had&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;that that&lt;/i&gt; in the book by way of example,â€™ said Lady Cavendish. â€˜You would have thought that that first &lt;i&gt;had had&lt;/i&gt; had had good occasion to be seen as &lt;i&gt;had&lt;/i&gt;, had you not? &lt;i&gt;Had&lt;/i&gt; had had approval but &lt;i&gt;had had&lt;/i&gt; had not; equally it is true to say that that &lt;i&gt;that that&lt;/i&gt; had had approval but that that other &lt;i&gt;that that&lt;/i&gt; had not.â€™ 

 â€˜So the problem with that other &lt;i&gt;that that&lt;/i&gt; was thatâ€¦?â€™

 â€˜That that other-other &lt;i&gt;that that&lt;/i&gt; had had approval.â€™ 

 â€˜Okayâ€™ said the Bellman, whose head was in danger of falling apart like a chocolate orange, â€˜let me get this straight: David Copperfield, unlike Pilgrimâ€™s Progress, had had &lt;i&gt;had&lt;/i&gt;, had had &lt;i&gt;had had&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Had had&lt;/i&gt; had had TGCâ€™s approval?â€™

 There was a very long pause. â€˜Right,â€™ said the Bellman with a sigh, â€˜thatâ€™s it for the moment. Iâ€™ll be giving out assignments in ten minutes. Sessionâ€™s over â€“ and letâ€™s be careful out there." -- Jasper Fforde]]>
