	    <![CDATA["I heartily accept the motto, &quot;That government is best which governs least&quot;; and I should like to see it acted up to more rapidly and systematically. Carried out, it finally amounts to this, which also I believe â€” &quot;That government is best which governs not at all&quot;; and when men are prepared for it, that will be the kind of government which they will have. Government is at best but an expedient; but most governments are usually, and all governments are sometimes, inexpedient." -- Henry David Thoreau]]>
