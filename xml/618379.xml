	    <![CDATA["... I did not set out to be beloved and just, only strong.&quot;

'A King can be better than that,&quot; the Prince insisted.

&quot;And so we all begin, determined to better our fathers' performances, knowing we can change the very nature of humanity, make it better, cleaner. But then daggers strike in the night, and peasants revolt, and all manner of atrocities become a necessity as breakfast. Only Princes believe in the greater good. Kings know there is only Reign, and all things may be committed in its holy name..." -- Catherynne Valente]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Sharp knives seemed to cut her delicate feet, yet she hardly felt them, so deep was the pain in her heart. She could not forget that this was the last night she would ever see the one for whom she had left her home and family, had given up her beautiful voice, and had day by day endured unending torment, of which he knew nothing at all. An eternal night awaited her. " -- Hans Christian Andersen]]>
