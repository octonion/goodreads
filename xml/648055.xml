		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Let's tell the truth to people. When people ask, 'How are you?' have the nerve sometimes to answer truthfully.  You must know, however, that people will start avaoiding you because, they, too, have knees that pain them and heads that hurt and they don't want to know about yours.  But think of it this way: If people avoid you, you will have more time to meditate and do fine research on a cure for whatever truly afflicts you." -- Maya Angelou]]>
