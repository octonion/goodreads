		<description>
	    <![CDATA["When I was young, I had to choose between the life of being and the life of doing. And I leapt at the latter like a trout to a fly. But each deed you do, each act, binds you to itself and to its consequences, and makes you act again and yet again. Then very seldom do you come upon a space, a time like this, between act and act, when you may stop and simply be. Or wonder who, after all, you are." -- Ursula K. Le Guin]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I think there is no way to write about being alone. To write is to tell something to somebody to communicate to others. . . . Solitude is noncommunication, the absence of others, the presence of a self sufficient to itself." -- Ursula K. Le Guin]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["To oppose something is to maintain itâ€¦ To be sure, if you turn your back on [something] and walk away from it, you are still on the [same] road. To oppose vulgarity is inevitably to be vulgar. You must go somewhere else; you must have another goal; then you walk a different road." -- Ursula K. LeGuin]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["In its silence, a book is a challenge:  it can't lull you with surging music or deafen you with screeching laugh tracks or fire gunshots in your living room; you have to listen to it in your head.  A book won't move your eyes for you the way images on a screen do. It won't move your mind unless you give it your mind, or your heart unless you put your heart in it ... To read a story well is to follow it, to act it, to feel it, to become it--everything short of writing it, in fact.  Reading is not interactive with a set of rules or options, as games are; reading is actual collaboration with the writer's mind.  No wonder not everyone is up to it." -- Ursula K. Le Guin]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I think people are very brave and often are a lot more frightened than they're allowed to admit.  Life is much harder to live for most people than we want to admit.  And so many things take a summoning up of courage.  It makes one's own life a little bit easier when you can acknowledge that.
-Ursula LeGuin, interviewed by" -- Brenda Peterson]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["It is a terrible thing, this kindess that human beings do not lose. Terrible, because when we are finally naked in the dark and cold, it is all we have. We who are so rich, so full of strength, we end up with that small change. We have nothing else to give. " -- Ursula K. Le Guin]]>
