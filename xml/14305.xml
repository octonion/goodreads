	    <![CDATA["Habla de un allegado. Es frágil, dice. No es sólido, dice. Puedes ser sólido y frágil. Por otra parte, la fragilidad es lo que hace soportable la solidez.
Oigo la última frase como destinada a él mismo." -- Yasmina Reza]]>

	    <![CDATA["Strange and mysterious things, though, aren't they - earthquakes? We take it for granted that the earth beneath our feet is solid and stationary. We even talk about people being 'down to earth' or having their feet firmly planted on the ground. But suddenly one day we see that it isn't true. The earth, the boulders, that are supposed to be solid, all of a sudden turn as mushy as liquid - From the short story &quot;Thailand" -- Haruki Murakami]]>

	    <![CDATA["I think about how truly interesting and odd it is that when a woman marries, traditionally she loses her name, becoming absorbed by the husband's family name - she is in effect lost, evaporated from all records under her maiden name. I finally understand the anger behind feminism - the idea that as a woman you are property to be conveyed between your father and your husband, but never an individual who exists independently. And on the flip side, it is also one of the few ways one can legitimately get lost - no one questions it." -- A.M. Homes]]>
