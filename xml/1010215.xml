	    <![CDATA["We are taught you must blame your father, your sisters, your brothers, the school, the teachers - but never blame yourself. It's never your fault. But it's always your fault, because if you wanted to change you're the one who has got to change." -- Katharine Hepburn]]>

	    <![CDATA["I have known the joy and pain of friendship.  I have served and been served.  I have made some good enemies for which I am not a bit sorry.  I have loved unselfishly, and I have fondled hatred with the red-hot tongs of Hell.  That's living." -- Zora Neale Hurston]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Forgiveness is not about forgetting. It is about letting go of another person's throat......Forgiveness does not create a relationship. Unless people speak the truth about what they have done and change their mind and behavior, a relationship of trust is not possible. When you forgive someone you certainly release them from judgment, but without true change, no real relationship can be established.........Forgiveness in no way requires that you trust the one you forgive. But should they finally confess and repent, you will discover a miracle in your own heart that allows you to reach out and begin to build between you a bridge of reconciliation.........Forgiveness does not excuse anything.........You may have to declare your forgiveness a hundred times the first day and the second day, but the third day will be less and each day after, until one day you will realize that you have forgiven completely.  And then one day you will pray for his wholeness......" -- William P. Young]]>
