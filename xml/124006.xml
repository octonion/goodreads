	    <![CDATA["…It’s hard to appreciate the beauty of a world when one doubts its very validity….But I’ve long since lost all such doubts, Ono,’ he continued. ‘When I am an old man, when I look back over my life and see I have devoted it to the task of capturing the unique beauty of that world, I believe I will be well satisfied. And no man will make me believe I’ve wasted my time." -- Kazuo Ishiguro]]>

	    <![CDATA["Nos-tal-gic,’ Akira said, as though it were a word he had been struggling to find. Then he said a word in Japanese, perhaps the Japanese for ‘nostalgic.’ ‘Nos-tal-gic. It is good to be nos-tal-gic. Very important.’

‘Really, old fellow?’

‘Important. Very important. Nostalgic. When we nostalgic, we remember. A world better than this world we discover when we grow. We remember and wish good world come back again. So very important. Just now, I had dream. I was boy. Mother, Father, close to me. in our house.’

He fell silent and continued to gaze across the rubble.

‘Akira,’ I said, sensing that the longer this talk went on, the greater was some danger I did not wish fully to articulate. ‘We should move on. We have much to do." -- Kazuo Ishiguro]]>

	    <![CDATA["The colonel nodded. &quot;Our childhood seems so far away now. All this&quot; - he gestured out of the vehicle - &quot;so much suffering. One of our Japanese poets, a court lady many years ago, wrote how sad this was. She wrote of how our childhood  becomes like a foreign land once we have grown.&quot;
&quot;Well, Colonel, it's hardly a foreign land to me. In many ways, it's where I've continued to live all my life. It's only now I've started to make my journey from it." -- Kazuo Ishiguro ]]>
