	    <![CDATA["Have you fallen in love with the wrong person yet?'
Jace said, &quot;Unfortunately, Lady of the Haven, my one true love remains myself.&quot;

	    <![CDATA["But-&quot; Maia, still looking at Alec and Magnus, broke off and rasied her eyebrows. Simon turned to see what she was looking at - and stared.
Alec had his arms around Magnus and was kissing him full on the mouth. Magnus, who appeared to be in a state of shock, stood frozen. Several groups of people - Shadowhunters and Downworlders alike - were staring and whispering. Glancing to the side, Simon saw the Lightwoods, their eyes widen, gaping at the display. Maryse had her hand over her mouth.
Maia looked perplexed. &quot;Wait a second,&quot; she said. &quot;Do we all have to do that, too?" -- Cassandra Clare]]>

	    <![CDATA["You guessed? You must have been pretty sure, considering you could have killed me.&quot;
&quot;I was ninety percent sure.&quot;
&quot;I see,&quot; Clary said. There must have been something in her voice, because he turned to look at her. Her hand cracked across his face, a slap that rocked him back on his heels. He put his hands on his cheek, more in surprise than pain.
&quot;What the hell was that for?&quot;
&quot;The other ten percent." -- Cassandra Clare]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["It quickly became a tracking operation, though. My chariot could not keep up with his truck. By the time I caught up with him, his truck was parked in one of those asphalt wastelands. What are they called again&quot;?
The Tuatha De Danann have no problem asking Druids for information. That's what we're for, after all.  The secret to becoming an Old Druid instead of a dead Druid is to betray nary a hint of condescension when answering even the simplest questions.
&quot;They are called parking lots,&quot; I replied.
&quot;Ah, yes, thank you. He came out of a building called 'Crussh', holding one of these potions. Are you familar with the building, Druid?&quot;
&quot;I belive that is a smoothie bar in England.&quot;
&quot;Quite right. So after I killed him and stowed his body next to the doe, I sampled his smooth concoction in the parking lot and found it to be quite delicious&quot;.
See, sentences like that are why I nurture a healthy fear of the Tuatha De Danann." -- Kevin Hearne]]>

	    <![CDATA["Every life has a watershed moment, an instant when you realize you're about to make a choice that will define everything else you ever do, and that if you choose wrong, there may not be that many things left to choose. Sometimes the wrong choice is the only one that lets you face the end with dignity, grace, and the awareness that you're doing the right thing.
I'm not sure we can recognize those moments until they've passed us." -- Mira Grant]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["This is the truth: We are a nation accustomed to being afraid. If I’m being honest, not just with you but with myself, it’s not just the nation, and it’s not just something we’ve grown used to. It’s the world, and it’s an addiction. People crave fear. Fear justifies everything. Fear makes it okay to have surrendered freedom after freedom, until our every move is tracked and recorded in a dozen databases the average man will never have access to. Fear creates, defines, and shapes our world, and without it, most of us would have no idea what to do with ourselves. Our ancestors dreamed of a world without boundaries, while we dream new boundaries to put around our homes, our children, and ourselves. We limit our potential day after day in the name of a safety that we refuse to ever achieve. We took a world that was huge with possibility, and we made it as small as we could." -- Mira Grant]]>
