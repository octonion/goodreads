	    <![CDATA["You are my heart as it beats within my chest, my soul as it moves through my mind.  The breath in my body that so fascinates you is your essence pouring in and out of me in a wave that drowns me over and over again until I cannot breathe for wanting you.  Needing you." -- Jacquelyn Frank]]>

	    <![CDATA["She had told him that she loved him. He had known that, but hearing it in the traditional phrase had affected him in new and blinding ways.
Ways that made him believe that he could do anything.
Anything she needed or wanted him to do. 
Because her loving him meant so much more than him loving her." -- Jacquelyn Frank]]>
