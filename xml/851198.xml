&lt;u&gt;Addiction&lt;/u&gt; - When you can give up something any time, as long as it's next Tuesday.
&lt;u&gt;Cocaine&lt;/u&gt; - Peruvian Marching Powder. A stimulant that has the extraordinary effect that the more you do, the more you laugh out of context.
&lt;u&gt;Depression&lt;/u&gt; - When everything you laugh at is miserable and you can't seem to stop.
&lt;u&gt;Heroin&lt;/U&gt; - A drug that helps you to escape reality, while making it much harder to cope when you are recaptured.
&lt;u&gt;Psychosis&lt;/u&gt; - When everybody turns into tiny dolls and they have needles in their mouths and they hate you and you don't care because you have THE KNIFE! AHAHAHAHAHAHA!" -- Nikki Sixx]]>

At birth we are very much like a new hard drive - no viruses, no bad information, no crap that's been downloaded into it yet. It's what we feed into that hard drive, or in my case &quot;head drive&quot; that starts the corruption of the files." -- Nikki Sixx]]>
