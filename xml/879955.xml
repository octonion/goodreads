	    <![CDATA["And they are dancing, the board floor slamming under the jackboots and the fiddlers grinning hideously over their canted pieces. Towering over them all is the judge and he is naked and dancing, his small feet lively and quick and now in doubletime and bowing to the ladies, huge and pale and hairless, like an enormous infant. He never sleeps, he says. He says he will never die. He bows to the fiddlers and sashays backwards and throws back his head and laughs deep in his throat and he is a great favorite, the judge. He wafts his hat and the lunar dome of his skull passes palely under the lamps and he swings about and takes possession of one of the fiddles and he pirouettes and makes a pass, two passes, dancing and fiddling at once. His feet are light and nimble. He never sleeps. He says that he will never die. He dances in light and shadow and he is a great favorite. He never sleeps, the judge. He is dancing, dancing. He says that he will never die." -- Cormac McCarthy Blood Meridian]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["And meanwhile, even in spite of all my desire, I could never imagine to myself that there is no future life and no providence.  Most likely there is all that, but we don't understand anything about the future life and its laws.  But if it is so difficult and even completely impossible to understand it, can it be that I will have to answer for being unable to comprehend the unknowable? True, they say, and the prince, of course, along with them, that it is here that obedience is necessary, that one must obey without reasoning, out of sheer good behavior, and that I am bound to be rewarded for my meekness in the other world.  We abase providence too much by ascribing our own notions to it, being vexed that we can't understand it.  But, again, if it's impossible to understand it, then, I repeat, it is hard to have to answer for something it is not given to man to understand.  And if so, how are they going to judge me for being unable to understand the true will and laws of providence? No, we'd better leave religion alone." -- Fyodor Dostoevsky]]>

	    <![CDATA["I flung open the door. I got a momentary flash of about a hundred and fifteen cats of all sizes and colours scrapping in the middle of the room, and then they all shot past me with a rush and out of the front door; and all that was left of the mobscene was the head of a whacking big fish, lying on the carpet and staring up at me in a rather austere sort of way, as if it wanted a written explanation and apology." -- P.G.

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["A man's at odds to know his mind cause his mind is aught he has to know it with. He can know his heart, but he dont want to. Rightly so. Best not to look in there. It aint the heart of a creature that is bound in the way that God has set for it. You can find meanness in the least of creatures, but when God made man the devil was at his elbow. A creature that can do anything. Make a machine. And a machine to make the machine. And evil that can run itself a thousand years, no need to tend it." -- Cormac McCarthy]]>

For each fire is all fires, and the first fire and the last ever to be." -- Cormac McCarthy]]>
