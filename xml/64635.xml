		<description>
	    <![CDATA["There comes a point when you just love someone. Not because they're good, or bad, or anything really. You just love them. It doesn't mean you'll be together forever. It doesn't mean you won't hurt each other. It just mean you love them. Sometimes in spite of who they are, and sometimes because of who they are. And you know that they love you, sometimes because of who you are, and sometimes in spite of it." -- Laurell K. Hamilton]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["She should have remembered that people have given everything they own, everything they are, to be taken care of, and to have their pain gone.  It's the lure of cults: the promise of a good family; it's what people think love is, but love isn't absence of pain, it's a hand to hold while you're going through it.  " -- Laurell K. Hamilton]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Sometimes it's not the optimist you need, but another pessimist to walk beside you and know, absolutely know, that the sound in the dark is a monster, and it really is as bad as you think. 

Did that sound hopeless? It didn't feel hopeless. It felt reassuring. It felt - real." -- Laurell K. Hamilton]]>
