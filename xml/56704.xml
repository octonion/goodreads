	    <![CDATA["For West is where we all plan to go some day. It is where you go when the land gives out and the old-field pines encroach. It is where you go when you get the letter saying: Flee, all is discovered. It is where you go when you look down at the blade in your hand and the blood on it. It is where you go when you are told that you are a bubble on the tide of empire. It is where you go when you hear that thar's gold in them-thar hills. It is where you go to grow up with the country. It is where you go to spend your old age. Or it is just where you go." -- Robert Penn Warren]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Knowledge can last, principles can last, habits can last; but feelings come and go... But, of course, ceasing to be &quot;in love&quot; need not mean ceasing to love. Love in this second sense — love as distinct from &quot;being in love&quot; — is not merely a feeling. It is a deep unity, maintained by the will and deliberately strengthened by habit; reinforced by (in Christian marriage) the grace which both partners ask, and receive, from God... &quot;Being in love&quot; first moved them to promise fidelity: this quieter love enables them to keep the promise. It is on this love that the engine of marriage is run: being in love was the explosion that started it." -- C.S. Lewis]]>
