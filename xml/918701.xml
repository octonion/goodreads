	    <![CDATA["I remembered what Morrie said during our visit: “The culture we have does not make people feel good about themselves.  And you have to be strong enough to say if the culture doesn’t work, don’t buy it.”

&quot;Morrie true to these words, had developed his own culture – long before he got sick.  Discussion groups, walks with friends, dancing to his music in the Harvard Square church.  He started a project called Greenhouse, where poor people could receive mental health services.  He read books to find new ideas for his classes, visited with colleagues, kept up with old students, wrote letters to distant friends.  He took more time eating and looking at nature and wasted not time in front of TV sitcoms or “Movies of the Week.”  He had created a cocoon of human activities– conversations, interaction, affection–and it filled his life like an overflowing soup bowl." -- Mitch Albom]]>
