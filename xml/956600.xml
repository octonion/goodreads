	    <![CDATA["Nature is God's first missionary.  Where there is no Bible there are sparkling stars.  Where there are not preachers there are spring times...
If a person has nothing but nature, then nature is enough to reveal something about God." -- Max Lucado]]>

	    <![CDATA["The most beautiful people we have known are those who have known defeat, known suffering, known struggle, known loss, and have found their way out of the depths. These persons have an appreciation, a sensitivity, and an understanding of life that fills them with compassion, gentleness, and a deep loving concern. Beautiful people do not just happen." -- Elisabeth Kübler-Ross]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["In the moment when I truly understand my enemy, understand him well enough to defeat him, then in that very moment I also love him. I think it’s impossible to really understand somebody, what they want, what they believe, and not love them the way they love themselves. And then, in that very moment when I love them.... I destroy them." -- Orson Scott Card]]>
