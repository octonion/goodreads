	    <![CDATA["You develop an instant global consciousness, a people orientation, an intense dissatisfaction with the state of the world, and a compulsion to do something about it. From out there on the moon, international politics look so petty. You want to grab a politician by the scruff of the neck and drag him a quarter of a million miles out and say, â€˜Look at that, you son of a bitch." -- Edgar Mitchell]]>

	    <![CDATA["The desire to live life to its fullest, to acquire more knowledge, to abandon the economic treadmill, are all typical reactions to these experiences in altered states of consciousness.  The previous fear of death is typically quelled.  If the individual generally remains thereafter in the existential state of awareness, the deep internal feeling of eternity is quite profound and unshakable." -- Edgar Mitchell]]>
