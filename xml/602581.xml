It's all the sons who become blacksmiths because their fathers were blacksmiths.  It's all the people who could be really fantastic flute players who grow old and die without ever seeing a musical instrument, so they become bad plowmen instead.  It's all the people with talents who never even find out.  Maybe they are never even &lt;i&gt;born&lt;/i&gt; in a time when it's even possible to find out.  It's all the people who never get to know what it is that they can really be.  &lt;i&gt;It's all the wasted chances&lt;/i&gt;." -- Terry Pratchett]]>
