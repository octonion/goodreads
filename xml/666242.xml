	    <![CDATA["My interpreter Sayuri is folding a piece of notebook paper.  She is at step 21, where the crane's body is inflated.  The directions show a tiny puff besides an arrow pointing at the bird.  It makes sense if you already know what to do.  Otherwise, it's wonderfully surreal: &lt;i&gt;Put a cloud inside a bird.&lt;/i&gt;" -- Mary Roach]]>

&quot;She said, 'Fuck me.' &quot; Phin put two balls on the table and picked up his cue. &quot;I interpreted that to mean she wanted sex.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot; Wes picked up his cue. &quot;That would have been my call, too.&quot; He squinted at the table.  &quot;Why would she have said that?&quot;

&quot;Isn't that an admission of guilt, Detective?&quot;
&quot;Legally, it's a neutral position.&quot;
&quot;Oh, but it's morally damning, isn't it?&quot;

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["When, however, one reads of a witch being ducked, of a woman possessed by devils, of a wise woman selling herbs, or even of a very remarkable man who had a mother, then I think we are on the track of a lost novelist, a suppressed poet, of some mute and inglorious Jane Austen, some Emily Bronte who dashed her brains out on the moor or mopped and mowed about the highways crazed with the torture that her gift had put her to. &lt;i&gt;Indeed, I would venture to guess that Anon, who wrote so many poems without signing them, was often a woman.&lt;/i&gt;" -- Virginia Woolf]]>

&quot;Jude!&quot; she cried, stomping her foot before she realized she'd done it.
&quot;I'd kiss you now if I wasn't sure that you'd bit me.&quot;
