		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Maybe you think you’ll be entitled to more happiness later by forgoing all of it now, but it doesn’t work that way. Happiness takes as much practice as unhappiness does. It’s by living that you live more. By waiting you wait more. Every waiting day makes your life a little less. Every lonely day makes you a little smaller. Every day you put off your life makes you less capable of living it." -- Ann Brashares]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I have a little theory that I'd like to air here, if I may. What is it that you think makes you magicians?&quot; More silence. Fogg was well into rhetorical-question territory now anyway. He spoke more softly. &quot;Is it because you are intelligent? Is it because you are brave and good? Is is because you're special? 

Maybe. Who knows. But I'll tell you something: I think you're magicians because you're unhappy. A magician is strong because he feels pain. He feels the difference between what the world is and what he would make of it. Or what did you think that stuff in your chest was? A magician is strong because he hurts more than others. His wound is his strength. 

Most people carry that pain around inside them their whole lives, until they kill the pain by other means, or until it kills them. But you, my friends, you found another way: a way to use the pain. To burn it as fuel, for light and warmth. You have learned to break the world that has tried to break you." -- Lev Grossman]]>

	    <![CDATA["But I don't want comfort. I want God, I want poetry, I want real danger, I want freedom, I want goodness, I want sin.'

'In fact,' said Mustapha Mond, 'you're claiming the right to be unhappy.'  

'All right then,' said the Savage defiantly, 'I'm claiming the right to be unhappy.'
  
'Not to mention the right to grow old and ugly and impotent; the right to have syphilis and cancer; the right to have too little to eat; the right to be lousy; the right to live in constant apprehension of what may happen tomorrow; the right to catch typhoid; the right to be tortured by unspeakable pains of every kind.' There was a long silence. 

'I claim them all,' said the Savage at last.

Mustapha Mond shrugged his shoulders. 'You're welcome,&quot; he said." -- Aldous Huxley]]>

	    <![CDATA["If you have done something meritorious, you experience pleasure and happiness; if wrong things, suffering.  A happy or unhappy life is your own creation.  Nobody else is responsible.  If you remember this, you won’t find fault with anybody.  You are your own best friend as well as your worst enemy.  (99)" -- Sri S. Satchidananda]]>
