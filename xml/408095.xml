I can't help imagining that perhaps, just as we get to the middle, they'll crumple up like a jackknife and nip us.  So I shut my eyes.  But I always have to open them for all when I think we're getting near the middle.  Because, you see, if the bridge did crumple up I'd want to see it crumple.  What a jolly rumble it makes!  I always like the rumble part of it.  Isn't it splendid there are so many things to like in this world?  There, we're over.  Now I'll look back.  Good night, dear Lake of Shining Waters.  I always say good night to the things I love, just as I would to people.  I think they like it.  That water looks as if it was smiling at me." -- L.M. Montgomery]]>
