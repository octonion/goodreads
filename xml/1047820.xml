	    <![CDATA["Why do you go away?  So that you can come back.  So that you can see the place you came from with new eyes and extra colors.  And the people there see you differently, too.  Coming back to where you started is not the same as never leaving." -- Terry Pratchett]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The stories never said why she was wicked. It was enough to be an old woman, enough to be all alone, enough to look strange because you have no teeth. It was enough to be called a witch. If it came to that, the book never gave you the evidence of anything. It talked about &quot;a handsome prince&quot;... was he really, or was it just because he was a prince that people called handsome? As for &quot;a girl who was as beautiful as the day was long&quot;... well, which day? In midwinter it hardly ever got light! The stories don't want you to think, they just wanted you to believe what you were told..." -- Terry Pratchett]]>

	    <![CDATA["You’d better tell me what you know, toad,” said Tiffany. “Miss Tick isn’t here. I am.”
“Another world is colliding with this one,” said the toad. “There. Happy now? That’s what Miss Tick thinks.  But it’s happening faster than she expected. All the monsters are coming back.”
“Why?”
“There’s no one to stop them.”
There was silence for a moment.
“There’s me,” said Tiffany." -- Terry Pratchett]]>
