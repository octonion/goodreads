	    <![CDATA["Yes Yes

when God created love he didn't help most 
when God created dogs He didn't help dogs 
when God created plants that was average 
when God created hate we had a standard utility 
when God created me He created me 
when God created the monkey He was asleep 
when He created the giraffe He was drunk 
when He created narcotics He was high 
and when He created suicide He was low 

when He created you lying in bed 
He knew what He was doing 
He was drunk and He was high 
and He created the mountains and the sea and fire at the same time 

He made some mistakes 
but when He created you lying in bed 
He came all over His Blessed Universe." -- Charles Bukowski]]>

	    <![CDATA["beware the average man the average woman 
beware their love, their love is average 
seeks average 

but there is genius in their hatred 
there is enough genius in their hatred to kill you 
to kill anybody 

not wanting solitude 
not understanding solitude 
they will attempt to destroy anything 
that differs from their own 

not being able to create art 
they will not understand art 
they will consider their failure as creators 
only as a failure of the world" -- Charles Bukowski]]>

	    <![CDATA["What's genius? I don't know but I do know that the difference between a madman and a professional is that a pro does as well as he can within what
he has set out to do and a madman does exceptionally well at what he can't help doing." -- Charles Bukowski]]>

	    <![CDATA["and when love came to us twice 
and lied to us twice 
we decided to never love again 
that was fair 
fair to us 
and fair to love itself. 

we ask for no mercy or no 
miracles; 
we are strong enough to live 
and to die and to 
kill flies, 

attend the boxing matches, go to the racetrack, 
live on luck and skill, 
get alone, get alone often, 
and if you can't sleep alone 
be careful of the words you speak in your sleep; 
and 
ask for no mercy 
no miracles; 

and don't forget: 
time is meant to be wasted, 
love fails
and death is useless." -- Charles Bukowski]]>
