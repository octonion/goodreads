	    <![CDATA["Time goes too quickly.  This is the advice that my mother should have given me from her hospital bed.  Instead of vague, unknowable quips like &quot;Be careful what you wish for,&quot; she should have told me time slides away on a hillside of loose shale and takes everything in its path - dreams, opportunities, hopes.  And youth.  It takes that fastest of all." -- Kristin Hannah]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["What I really fear is time. That's the devil: whipping us on when we'd rather loll, so the present sprints by, impossible to grasp, and all is suddenly past, a past that won't hold still, that slides into these inauthentic tales. My past- it doesn't feel real in the slightest. The person who inhabited it is not me. It's as if the present me is constantly dissolving. There's that line from Heraclitus: 'No man steps in the same river twice, for it is not the same river and he is not the same man.' That's quite right. We enjoy this illusion of continuity, and we call it memory. Which explains, perhaps, why our worst fear isn't the end of life but the end of memories." -- Tom Rachman]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Here is a fact: nothing in all civilization has been as productive as ludicrous ambition. Whatever its ills, nothing has created more.  Cathedrals, sonatas, encyclopedias: love of God was not behind them, nor love of life.  But the love of man to be worshiped by man." -- Tom Rachman]]>

	    <![CDATA["I'm selfish, impatient and a little insecure. I make mistakes, I am out of control and at times hard to handle. But if you can't handle me at my worst, then you sure as hell don't deserve me at my best." -- Marilyn Monroe]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I believe that everything happens for a reason. People change so that you can learn to let go, things go wrong so that you appreciate them when they're right, you believe lies so you eventually learn to trust no one but yourself, and sometimes good things fall apart so better things can fall together." -- Marilyn Monroe]]>
