	    <![CDATA["Dream Bigger
You think. Stop letting 
small minded people
dictate your future
when all
they really want is for
you to accomplish
the work of two, for minimum
wage. Reach higher, or
&lt;b&gt;else&lt;/b&gt;
plan for retirement
in a cardboard box, praying
global warming is more
than a catchphrase.
And if that
&lt;b&gt;fails&lt;/b&gt;
to be the case,
hope freezing to death
is really as simple
as falling asleep,
to the lullaby of teeth chatter.
&lt;b&gt;Dream bigger&lt;/b&gt;
before you can't remember
how to dream at all." -- Ellen Hopkins]]>

	    <![CDATA["Books Fall Open

Books fall open,
you fall in,
delighted where,
you've never been.
Hear voices 
not once heard before,
Reach world through world,
through door on door.
Find unexpected 
keys to things,
locked up beyond
 imaginings….
True books will venture,
Dare you out,
Whisper secrets,
Maybe shout,
across the gloom,
to you in need
Who hanker for
a book to read." -- David McCord]]>
