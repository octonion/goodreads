	    <![CDATA["I am struck by how, except when you're young, you really need to prioritize in life, figuring out in what order you should divide up your time and energy. If you don't get that sort of system set by a certain age, you'll lack focus and your life will be out of balance." -- Haruki Murakami]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["It was a sombre snowy afternoon, and the gas-lamps were lit in the big reverberating station. As he paced the platform, waiting for the Washington express, he remembered that there were people who thought there would one day be a tunnel under the Hudson through which the trains of the Pennsylvania railway would run straight into New York. They were of the brotherhood of visionaries who likewise predicted the building of ships that would cross the Atlantic in five days, the invention of a flying machine, lighting by electricity, telephonic communication without wires, and other Arabian Nights marvels." -- Edith Wharton]]>

	    <![CDATA["I can't describe the feeling he gave me,&quot; Howard said later, &quot;but somehow I knew he had what it takes. Tom and I realized that we had our worries and troubles ahead. We had to rebuild him, both mentally and physically, but you don't have to rebuild the heart when it's already there, big as all outdoors." -- Laura Hillenbrand]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["As he ran next to Noriko, a thought suddenly occurred to him. The screaming, their hasty footsteps, and the officer warning them to stop all receded as his mind was occupied with this thought.
It might have been inappropriate. And besidesâ€¦ he'd ripped it off. Oh, man. 
But still he thought this:
&lt;i&gt;Together Noriko we'll live with the sadness. I'll love you with all the madness in my soul. Someday girl I don't know when we're gonna get to that place. Where we really want to go and we'll walk in the sun. But till then tramps like us baby we were born to run.&lt;/i&gt;" -- Koushun Takami]]>

	    <![CDATA["Someday an opportunity will come. Think about Harry Potter. His life is terrible, but then a letter arrives, he gets on a train, and everything is different for him afterward. Better. Magical.&quot;
&quot;That's just a story.&quot;
&quot;So are we- we're stories too." -- Matthew Quick]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I love those dark moments in Peanuts. I love that they're in there, that Charles Schulz put the sad lonely bits of himself into the comic. I love the silliness too, the dancing Snoopy strips. The little boy Rerun drawing &quot;basement&quot; comics about Tarzan fighting Daffy Duck in a helicopter. Those are the bits that keep me reading. The funny parts! The fun parts. The silly bits that don't make any sense. And when I get to the sad lonely Peppermint Patty standing in a field wondering why nobody shook hands and said &quot;good game,&quot; well, it works because that's not all she was. I try to think that way about everything. That's the kind of person I want to be." -- Joey Comeau]]>
