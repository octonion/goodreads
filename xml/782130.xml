		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["At first she thought the writing would be easy.  She was extremely confident in her ability to dream, to imagine, and she supposed that expressing her dreams in words, in writing, would be entirely natural, like drawing breath.  She had read widely from the time she was a child, and she knew how to recognize something that was well written.  She admired certain lines and passages so much that she had taken complete possession of them and committed them to memory.  She could recite “The Gettysburg Address” and “The Twenty-Third Psalm.”  She could recite “Jabberwocky” and Emily Dickinson’s “Further in summer that the birds” and Wallace Stevens’s “Sunday Morning.”  She knew by heart the final paragraph of Joyce’s “The Dead,” and if challenged she could say in whole the parts of both Romeo and Juliet.  And she knew many Kiowa stories and many long prayers in Navajo.  These were not feats of memory in the ordinary sense; it was simply that she attended to these things so closely that they became a part of her most personal experience.  She had assumed them, appropriated them to her being.
But to write!  She discovered that was something else again." -- N. Scott Momaday]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The last thing I ever wanted was to be alive when the three most powerful people on the whole planet would be named Bush, Dick and Colon.

Our government's got a war on drugs....But get this: The two most widely abused and addictive and destructive of all substances are both perfectly legal.

One, of course, is ethyl alcohol.  And President George W. Bush, no less, and by his own admission, was smashed, or tiddley-poo, or four sheets to the wind a good deal of time from when he was sixteen until he was forty.  When he was forty-one, he says, Jesus appeared to him and made him knock off the sauce, stop gargling nose paint.

Other drunks have seen pink elephants." -- Kurt Vonnegut]]>

	    <![CDATA["Socialism&quot; is no more an evil word than &quot;Christianity.&quot; Socialism no more prescribed Joseph Stalin and his secret police and shuttered churches than Christianity prescribed the Spanish Inquisition.

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["And my car back then, a Studebaker as I recall, was powered, as are most of all means of transportation and other machinery today, and electric power plants and furnaces, by the most abused, addictive, and destructive drugs of all: fossil fuels.

When you got here, even when I got here, the industrialized world was already hopelessly hooked on fossil fuels, and very soon now there won't be any left.  Cold turkey.

Can I tell you the truth?  I mean this isn't the TV news is it?  Here's what I think the truth is: We are all addicts of fossil fuels in a state of denial.  And like so many addicts about to face cold turkey, our leaders are now committing violent crimes to get what little is left of what we're hooked on." -- Kurt Vonnegut]]>

And, except for the Garden of Eden, there were already all these games going on that could make you act crazy, even if you weren't crazy to begin with.  Some of the crazymaking games going on today are love and hate, liberalism and conservatism, automobiles and credit cards, golf, and girls' basketball." -- Kurt Vonnegut]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I became a so-called science fiction writer when someone decreed that I was a science fiction writer.  I did not want to be classified as one, so I wondered in what way I'd offended that I would not get credit for being a serious writer.  I decided that it was because I wrote about technology, and most fine American writers know nothing about technology.  I got classified as a science fiction writer simply because I wrote about Schenectady, New York. My first book, Player Piano, was about Schenectady. There are huge factories in Schenectady and nothing else.  I and my associates were engineers, physicists, chemists, and mathematicians. And when I wrote about the General Electric Company and Schenectady, it seemed a fantasy of the future to critics who had never seen the place." -- Kurt Vonnegut]]>

So the America I loved still exists, if not in the White House or the Supreme Court or the Senate or the House of Representatives or the media. The America I love still exists at the front desks of our public libraries." -- Kurt Vonnegut]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The first thing to understand about nutritionism is that it is not the same thing as nutrition. As the &quot;-ism&quot; suggests, it is not a scientific subject but an ideology. Ideologies are ways of organizing large swaths of life and experience under a set of shared but unexamined assumptions. This quality makes an ideology particularly hard to see, at least while it's still exerting its hold on your culture. A reigning ideology is a little like the weather--all pervasive and so virtually impossible to escape. Still, we can try." -- Michael Pollan]]>

	    <![CDATA["I don't think anybody can teach anybody anything. I think that you learn it, but the young writer that is as I say demon-driven and wants to learn and has got to write, he don't know why, he will learn from almost any source that he finds. He will learn from older people who are not writers, he will learn from writers, but he learns it -- you can't teach it." -- William Faulkner ]]>
