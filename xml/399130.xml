		<description>
	    <![CDATA["If the future's looking dark, 
We're the ones who have to shine. 
If there's no one in control, 
We're the ones who draw the line. 
Though we live in trying times, 
We're the ones who have to try. 
And we know that time has wings, 
So we're the ones who have to fly." -- Neil Peart]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I can worship Nature, and that fulfills my need for miracles and beauty.  Art gives a spiritual depth to existence -- I can find worlds bigger and deeper than my own in music, paintings, and books.  And from my friends and family I receive the highest benediction, emotional contact, and personal affirmation.  I can bow before the works of Man, from buildings to babies, and that fulfills my need for wonder.  I can believe in the sanctity of Life, and that becomes the Revealed Word, to live my life as I believe it should be, not as I'm told to by self-appointed guides." -- Neil Peart]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Spirituality is about being awake. It’s the attempt to transcend the mundane, sleepwalking experience of life we all fall into, to tap into the wonder of being a conscious and grateful thing in the midst of an astonishing universe. It doesn’t require religion. Religion can, in fact, and often does, blunt our awareness by substituting false (and dare I say inferior) wonders for real ones. It’s a fine joke on ourselves that most of what we call spirituality is actually about putting ourselves to sleep." -- Dale McGowan]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["That churchgoers do the lion's share of the charitable work in our communities is simply untrue. They get credit for it because they do a better job of tying the good works they do to their creed. But according to a 1998 study, 82% of volunteerism by churchgoers falls under the rubric of &quot;church maintenance&quot; activities -- volunteerism entirely within, and for the benefit of, the church building and immediate church community. As a result of this siphoning of volunteer energy into the care and feeding of churches themselves, most of the volunteering that happens out in the larger community -- from AIDS hospices to food shelves to international aid workers to those feeding the hungry and housing the homeless and caring for the elderly -- comes from the category of &quot;unchurched&quot; volunteers." -- Dale McGowan]]>
