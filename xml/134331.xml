		<description>
	    <![CDATA["	Christmas Amnesty.  You can fall out of contact with a friend, fail to return calls, ignore e-mails, avoid eye contact at the Thrifty-Mart, forget birthdays, anniversaries, and reunions, and if you show up at their house during the holidays (with a gift) they are socially bound to forgive you—act like nothing happened.  Decorum dictates that the friendship move forward from that point, without guilt or recrimination.  If you started a chess game ten years ago in October, you need only remember whose move it is—or why you sold the chessboard and bought an Xbox in the interim.  (Look, Christmas Amnesty is a wonderful thing, but it’s not a dimensional shift.  The laws of time and space continue to apply, even if you have been avoiding your friends.  But don’t try using the expansion of the universe an as excuse—like you kept meaning to stop by, but their house kept getting farther away.  That crap won’t wash.  Just say, “Sorry I haven’t called.  Merry Christmas”  Then show the present.  Christmas Amnesty protocol dictates that your friend say, “That’s okay,” and let you in without further comment.  This is the way it has always been done.)" -- Christopher Moore]]>
