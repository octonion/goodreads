		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The most important things are the hardest to say.  They are the things you get ashamed of, because words diminish them -- words shrink things that seemed limitless when they were in your head to no more than living size when they're brought out.  But it's more than that, isn't it? The most important things lie too close to wherever your secret heart is buried, like landmarks to a treasure your enemies would love to steal away.  And you may make revelations that cost you dearly only to have people look at you in a funny way, not understanding what you've said at all, or why you thought it was so important that you almost cried while you were saying it.  That's the worst, I think.  When the secret stays locked within not for want of a tellar but for want of an understanding ear." -- Stephen King]]>

They aren’t any such thing as good friend or bad friend.
Maybe there are just friend.
People who stand by you when you're hurt and who helped you feel not so lonely.
Maybe there are worth being scared for and hoping for and living for.
Maybe worth dying for too.
If that what has to be.
No bad friends.
Only people you want.
Need to be with.
People who build their houses in your heart." -- Stephen King]]>

Mad dogs with foam on our muzzles and shit drying on our hocks.&quot; &quot;What do you want, then?&quot; Eddie cried. &quot;You've taken everything else- everything I have to give! No, not even that, because in the end, I gave it to you! So what else do you want from me?&quot; Roland held the key which was their half of Jake Chamber's salvation locked in his fist and said nothing. His eyes held Eddie's, and the sun shone on the green expanse of plain and the blue-gray reach of the Send River, and somewhere in the distance the crow hailed again across the golden leagues of this fading summer afternoon. After awhile, understanding began to dawn in Eddie Dean's eyes. Roland nodded. &quot;I have forgotten the face. . .&quot; Eddie paused. Dipped his head. Swallowed. Looked up at the Gunslinger once more. The thing which had been dying among them had moved on now- Roland knew it. That thing was gone. Just like that. Here, on this sunny wind-swept ridge at the edge of everything, it had gone forever. &quot;I have forgotten the face of my father, gunslinger. . . and I cry your pardon.&quot; Roland opened his hand and returned the small burden of the key to him who ka had decreed must carry it. &quot;Speak not so, gunslinger,&quot; he said in the High Speech. &quot;Your father sees you very well. . . loves you very well . . . and so do I.&quot; Eddie closed his own hand over the key and turned away with his tears still drying on his face. &quot;Let's go,&quot; he said, and they began to move down the long hill toward the plain which streched beyond." -- Stephen King]]>
