	    <![CDATA["When his life was ruined, his family killed, his farm destroyed, Job knelt down on the ground and yelled up to the heavens, &quot;Why god? Why me?&quot; and the thundering voice of God answered, There's just something about you that pisses me off." -- Stephen King]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The man walked past me and stopped, observing the blood running down my neck.

&quot;Your injury.  Let us tend to it.&quot;  He looked out through the open doorway and silently gestured to someone out there.  &quot;Our world,&quot; he said, &quot;is far more advanced than yours.  For reasons you'll understand shortly.&quot;

A thin, bony, naked woman entered the room, carrying two small, white kittens.  She sat one of the fluffy cats in my lap and stuffed the other down my shirt.  She turned and left.

&quot;There,&quot; said the large man.  &quot;The kittens will make your sad go away." -- David Wong]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I’m not sad, but the boys who are looking for sad girls always find me. I’m not a girl anymore and I’m not sad anymore. You want me to be a tragic backdrop so that you can appear to be illuminated, so that people can say ‘Wow, isn't he so terribly brave to love a girl who is so obviously sad?’ You think I’ll be the dark sky so you can be the star? I’ll swallow you whole." -- Warsan Shire]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Then, instead of telling her that where there was life there was hope, or to let a smile be her umbrella, or that it was always darkest just before the dawn, or anything else that had just lately fallen out of the dog's ass, she simply held her. Because sometimes only holding was best. That was one of the things she had taught that man whose last name she had taken for her own--that sometimes it was best to be quiet; sometimes it was best to just shut your everlasting mouth and hang on, hang on, hang on." -- Stephen King]]>

Whatever it was I wanted from my mother was simply not there to be had. It was not her fault. 

And it was therefore not my fault that I was unable to elicit it." -- Alison Bechdel]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["A child isn’t born bitter. I point no fingers as to who tainted the clean, pure pool of my childhood. Let’s just say that when I realized that I didn’t want to grow up, the damage was already done. Knowing that being grown up was no swell place to be means that you are grown up enough to notice. And you can’t go back from there. You have to forge another route, draw your own map." -- Hiromi Goto]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I realized that the childish impression I had always had of my father, as Just Lawgiver, was entirely wrong.  We were utterly dependent on this man, who was not only deluded and ignorant, but incompetent in every way.  What was more, I knew that my mother was incapable of standing up to him.  It was like walking into the cockpit of an airplane and finding the pilot and co-pilot passed out drunk in their seats.  And standing outside the Lyceum, I was struck with a black, incredulous horror, which in fact was not at all unlike the horror I had felt at twelve, sitting on a bar stool in our sunny little kitchen in Plano.  Who is in control here?  I thought, dismayed.  Who is flying this plane?" -- Donna Tartt]]>

Try to help others.  Always double-check your math if there are explosives involved.  If you screwed it up, you need to see it gets fixed.  And don't eat anything that talks.  If it doesn't fall under one of those categories, just do the best you can." -- Ursula Vernon]]>
