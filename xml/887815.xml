	    <![CDATA["People worry about kids playing with guns, and teenagers watching violent videos; we are scared that some sort of culture of violence will take them over.  Nobody worries about kids listening to thousands - literally thousands - of songs about broken hearts and rejection and pain and misery and loss." -- Nick Hornby]]>

	    <![CDATA["We all spend so much time not saying what we want, because we know we can't have it.  And because it sounds ungracious, or ungrateful, or disloyal, or childish, or banal.  Or because we're so desperate to pretend that things are OK, really, that confessing to ourselves they're not looks like a bad move.  Go on, say what you want.  ...  Whatever it is, say it to yourself.  The truth will set you free.  Either that or it'll get you a punch in the nose.  Surviving in whatever life you're living means lying, and lying corrodes the soul, so take a break from the lies for just one minute." -- Nick Hornby]]>

	    <![CDATA["It struck me as pretty ridiculous to be called Mr. Darcy and to stand on your own looking snooty at a party. It's like being called Heathcliff and insisting on spending the entire evening in the garden, shouting &quot;Cathy&quot; and banging your head against a tree." -- Helen Fielding]]>
