	    <![CDATA["Thanks to art, instead of seeing one world only, our own, we see that world multiply itself and we have at our disposal as many worlds as there are original artists, worlds more different one from the other than those which revolve in infinite space, worlds which, centuries after the extinction of the fire from which their light first emanated, whether it is called Rembrandt or Vermeer, send us still each one its special radiance." -- Marcel Proust]]>

	    <![CDATA["Every reader, as he reads, is actually the reader of himself.  The writer's work is only a kind of optical instrument he provides the reader so he can discern what he might never have seen in himself without this book.  The reader's recognition in himself of what the book says is the proof of the book's truth." -- Marcel Proust]]>

	    <![CDATA["You know what the fellow said – in Italy, for thirty years under the Borgias, they had warfare, terror, murder and bloodshed, but they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci and the Renaissance. In Switzerland, they had brotherly love, they had five hundred years of democracy and peace – and what did that produce? The cuckoo clock." -- Orson Welles]]>
