		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The most necessary task of civilization is to teach people how to think. It should be the primary purpose of our public schools. The mind of a child is naturally active, it develops through exercise. Give a child plenty of exercise, for body and brain. The trouble with our way of educating is that it does not give elasticity to the mind. It casts the brain into a mold. It insists that the child must accept. It does not encourage original thought or reasoning, and it lays more stress on memory than observation." -- Thomas A. Edison]]>

	    <![CDATA["Most learning is not the result of instruction. It is rather the result of unhampered participation in a meaningful setting. Most people learn best by being &quot;with it,&quot; yet school makes them identify their personal, cognitive growth with elaborate planning and manipulation." -- Ivan Illich]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Here’s the thing, effective parenting and, more specifically, effective discipline, don’t require punishment. Equating discipline with punishment is an unfortunate, but common misconception. The root word in discipline is actually disciple which in the verb form means to guide, lead, teach, model, and encourage. In the noun form disciple means one who embraces the teaching of, follows the example of, and models their life after." -- L.R. Knost]]>
