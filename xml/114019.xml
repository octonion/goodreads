	    <![CDATA["All that is gold does not glitter,
Not all those who wander are lost;
The old that is strong does not wither,
Deep roots are not reached by the frost.

From the ashes a fire shall be woken,
A light from the shadows shall spring;
Renewed shall be blade that was broken,
The crownless again shall be king." -- J.R.R. Tolkien]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["He has achieved success who has lived well, laughed often, and loved much;
Who has enjoyed the trust of pure women, the respect of intelligent men and the love of little children;
Who has filled his niche and accomplished his task;
Who has never lacked appreciation of Earth's beauty or failed to express it;
Who has left the world better than he found it,
Whether an improved poppy, a perfect poem, or a rescued soul;
Who has always looked for the best in others and given them the best he had;
Whose life was an inspiration;
Whose memory a benediction." -- Bessie Anderson Stanley]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["We all like to think the world ends when we do.  The truth is our acquaintances, our friends, and our loved ones all live on, and through them, so do we.  It's not about what you had, but what you gave.  It's not about how you looked, but how you lived.  And it's not just about being remembered.  It's about giving people a good reason to remember you." -- Tonya Hurley]]>

	    <![CDATA["Being in love with someone who doesn't even know you exist isn't the worst thing in the world. In fact, it's quite the oppostie. Almost like passing in a term paper that you know sucked, but having that period of time where you haven't gotten your grade back yet -- that kind of exhale where you haven't been rejected, although you pretty much know how it's going to turn out." -- Tonya Hurley]]>

	    <![CDATA["We all want to be stars.  The idea of being revered and envied must be encoded somewhere deep in our DNA.  So must the desire to revere and envy others we imagine to be better, more accepted, and more popular than we are.  The only problem is that the most necessary qualities required to be a celebrity -- self-absorption, egomania, shamelessness -- are the least attractive in a friend." -- Tonya Hurley]]>
