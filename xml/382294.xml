		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The books are to remind us what asses and fool we are. They're Caeser's praetorian guard, whispering as the parade roars down the avenue, &quot;Remember, Caeser, thou art mortal.&quot; Most of us can't rush around, talking to everyone, know all the cities of the world, we haven't time, money or that many friends. The things you're looking for, Montag, are in the world, but the only way the average chap will ever see ninety-nine per cent of them is in a book. Don't ask for guarantees. And don't look to be saved in any one thing, person, machine, or library. Do your own bit of saving, and if you drown, at least die knowing you were headed for shore." -- Ray Bradbury]]>

	    <![CDATA["The funeral was beautiful.
I didn't mind it, really.  It wasn't exactly Pop's funeral, to me.  When I'd been alone with him, there in the little room, well, that was it, as far as I was concerned.  I'd said good-bye to him, sort of, then.
This was just something you had to go through with, on account of other people and out of respect for Pop." -- Fredric Brown]]>
