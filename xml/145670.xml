	    <![CDATA["Characters take on life sometimes by luck, but I suspect it is when you can write more entirely out of yourself, inside the skin, heart, mind, and soul of a person who is not yourself, that a character becomes in his own right another human being on the page." -- Eudora Welty]]>

	    <![CDATA["Books are the carriers of civilization. Without books, history is silent, literature dumb, science crippled, thought and speculation at a standstill.  Without books, the development of civilization would have been impossible.  They are engines of change (as the poet said), windows on the world and lighthouses erected in the sea of time.  They are companions, teachers, magicians, bankers of the treasures of the mind. Books are humanity in print.

[&lt;i&gt;Bulletin of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences&lt;/i&gt;, Vol. 34, No. 2 (Nov. 1980), pp. 16-32]" -- Barbara Tuchman]]>

	    <![CDATA["Don't wait until everything is just right. It will never be perfect. There will always be challenges, obstacles and less than perfect conditions. So what. Get started now. With each step you take, you will grow stronger and stronger, more and more skilled, more and more self-confident and more and more successful." -- Mark Victor Hansen]]>
