		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Disturb us, Lord, when we are too well pleased with ourselves,  
when our dreams have come true because we have dreamed too little,  
when we arrive safely because we sailed too close to the shore.  

Disturb us, Lord, when with the abundance of things we possess, 
we have lost our thirst for the waters of life,  having fallen in love with life, we have ceased to dream of eternity,  and in our efforts to build a new earth,  
we have allowed our vision of the new heaven to dim.  

Disturb us, Lord, to dare more boldly, to venture on wider seas,  where storms will show your mastery,  where losing sight of land, we shall find the stars.  We ask you to push back the horizon of our hopes,  and to push us into the future in strength, courage, hope, and love.  This we ask in the name of our Captain, who is Jesus Christ. " -- Sir Francis Drake]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Perfectionism is the voice of the oppressor, the enemy of the people. It will keep you cramped and insane your whole life, and it is the main obstacle between you and a shitty first draft. I think perfectionism is based on the obsessive belief that if you run carefully enough, hitting each stepping-stone just right, you won't have to die. The truth is that you will die anyway and that a lot of people who aren't even looking at their feet are going to do a whole lot better than you, and have a lot more fun while they're doing it." -- Anne Lamott]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Are you born again?&quot; he asked, as we taxied down the runway. He was rather prim and tense, maybe a little like David Eisenhower with a spastic colon. I did not know how to answer for a moment.
&quot;Yes,&quot; I said. &quot;I am.&quot;
My friends like to tell each other that I am not really a born-again Christian. They think of me more along the lines of that old Jonathan Miller routine, where he said, &quot;I'm not really a Jew -- I'm Jew-ish.&quot; They think I am Christian-ish. But I'm not. I'm just a bad Christian. A bad born-again Christian. And certainly, like the apostle Peter, I am capable of denying it, of presenting myself as a sort of leftist liberation-theology enthusiast and maybe sort of a vaguely Jesusy bon vivant. But it's not true. And I believe that when you get on a plane, if you start lying you are totally doomed.
So I told the truth; that I am a believer, a convert. I'm probably about three months away from slapping an aluminum Jesus-fish on the back of my car, although I first want to see if the application or stickum in any way interferes with my lease agreement. And believe me, all this boggles even *my* mind. But it's true. I could go to a gathering of foot-wash Baptists and, except for my dreadlocks, fit right in. I would wash their feet; I would let them wash mine." -- Anne LaMott]]>
