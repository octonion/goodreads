	    <![CDATA["As they passed the rows of houses they saw through the open doors that men were sweeping and dusting and washing dishes, while the women sat around in groups, gossiping and laughing.

What has happened?' the Scarecrow asked a sad-looking man with a bushy beard, who wore an apron and was wheeling a baby carriage along the sidewalk.

Why, we've had a revolution, your Majesty -- as you ought to know very well,' replied the man; 'and since you went away the women have been running things to suit themselves.  I'm glad you have decided to come back and restore order, for doing housework and minding the children is wearing out the strength of every man in the Emerald City.'

Hm!' said the Scarecrow, thoughtfully.  'If it is such hard work as you say, how did the women manage it so easily?'

I really do not know,' replied the man, with a deep sigh.  'Perhaps the women are made of cast-iron." -- L. Frank Baum]]>

	    <![CDATA["Buy or borrow self-improvement books, but don't read them.  Stack them around your bedroom and use them as places to rest bowls of cookies.

Watch exercise shows on television, but don't do the exercises.  Practice believing that the benefit lies in imagining yourself doing the exercises.

Don't power walk.  Saunter slowly in the sun, eating chocolate, and carry a blanket so you can take a nap." -- SARK]]>
