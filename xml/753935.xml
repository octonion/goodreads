		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Against such a background one can easily imagine the shock that must have gripped readers of The Times of London, who turned to their paper one morning in January 1882 and found a lengthy report on a parliamentary speech by the attorney general concluding with the unexpectedly forthright statement: “The speaker then said he felt inclined for a bit of fucking.” Not surprisingly, it caused a sensation. The executives of The Times were so dumbstruck by this outrage against common decency that four full days passed before they could bring themselves to acknowledge the offense." -- Anonymous]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Not far removed from the palindrome is the anagram, in which the letters of a word or name are jumbled to make a new, and ideally telling, phrase. Thus “Ronald Wilson Reagan” becomes “Insane Anglo Warlord”; “Spiro Agnew” becomes -Grow a Penis." -- Anonymous]]>

	    <![CDATA["In fact, mackerel have a reputation the world over for their ostentatious shine. In England, calling a man a “mackerel” meant he was a dandy; in France, it meant he was a pimp. It is from the latter usage that we get the term “mack daddy." -- Trevor Corson]]>

	    <![CDATA["Being a cabbage has its drawbacks. Members of the cabbage family do not possess legs and can’t run away from predators. Instead, cabbages have evolved a high-tech defense system that would turn heads at the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons." -- Anonymous]]>
