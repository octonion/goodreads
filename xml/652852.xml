	    <![CDATA["I know that's what people say-- you'll get over it. I'd say it, too. But I know it's not true. Oh, youll be happy again, never fear. But you won't forget. Every time you fall in love it will be because something in the man reminds you of him." -- Betty  Smith]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Lost behind wishes not made,
The tears shiver in the dark
Masks don't slip,
Firmly secure,
Hiding words unsaid,
when they counted
But now, they are
Lost
to the ages
Where they will remain
For all eternity
Never to be spoken,
Lost." -- Emily Dana]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Love is the spice of life!&quot; Aunt Lydia picked up her glass and took a long drink before setting it down again. &quot;Did it end in heartache, dear?&quot; &quot;Well, yes...but it was the good kind of heart ache, Aunt Lydia. The kind where you'll always think fondly of each other, even though you know your love could never be.&quot; My aunt squealed with delight. &quot;Ooh, I just love stories that end that way! Those happy, sappy endings in romance novels aren't realistic at all. But if you can gaze up at the stars at night and think fondly of your lost love, then it's worth falling in love and losing him.&quot; &quot;You're absolutely right." -- Lynn Austin]]>

	    <![CDATA["It isn't possible to love and part.  You will wish that it was.  You can transmute love, ignore it, muddle it, but you can never pull it out of you. I know by experience that the poets are right:  love is eternal." -- E.M. Forster]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["If he’s not calling you, it’s because you are not on his mind. If he creates expectations for you, and then doesn’t follow through on little things, he will do same for big things. Be aware of this and realize that he’s okay with disappointing you. Don’t be with someone who doesn’t do what they say they’re going to do.  If he’s choosing not to make a simple effort that would put you at ease and bring harmony to a recurring fight, then he doesn’t respect your feelings and needs. “Busy” is another word for “asshole.” “Asshole” is another word for the guy you’re dating. You deserve a fcking phone call." -- Greg Behrendt]]>
