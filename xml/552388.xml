		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Now death is uncool, old-fashioned. To my mind the defining characteristic of our era is spin, everything tailored to vanishing point by market research, brands and bands manufactured to precise specifications; we are so used to things transmuting into whatever we would like them to be that it comes as a profound outrage to encounter death, stubbornly unspinnable, only and immutably itself." -- Tana French]]>

	    <![CDATA[https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/177343-you-get-them-wrong-before-you-meet-them-while-you-re]]>
		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["You get them wrong before you meet them, while you're anticipating meeting them; you get them wrong while you're with them; and then you go home to tell somebody else about the meeting and you get them all wrong again. Since the same generally goes for them with you, the whole thing is really a dazzling illusion. ... The fact remains that getting people right is not what living is all about anyway. It's getting them wrong that is living, getting them wrong and wrong and wrong and then, on careful reconsideration, getting them wrong again. That's how we know we're alive: we're wrong. Maybe the best thing would be to forget being right or wrong about people and just go along for the ride. But if you can do that -- well, lucky you." -- Philip Roth]]>

	    <![CDATA["There's a Spanish proverb,&quot; he said, &quot;that's always fascinated me. &quot;Take what you want and pay for it, says God.'&quot; &quot;I don't believe in God,&quot; Daniel said, &quot;but that principle seems, to me, to have a divinity of its own; a kind of blazing purity.  What could be simpler, or more crucial? You can have anything you want, as long as you accept that there is a price and that you will have to pay it." -- Tana French]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["You fight your superficiality, your shallowness, so as to try to come at people without unreal expectations, without an overload of bias or hope or arrogance, as untanklike as you can be, sans cannon and machine guns and steel plating half a foot thick; you come at them unmenacingly on your own ten toes instead of tearing up the turf with your caterpillar treads, take them on with an open mind, as equals, man to man, as we used to say, and yet you never fail to get them wrong.  You might as well have the brain of a tank.  You get them wrong before you meet them, while you're anticipating meeting them; you get them wrong while you're with them; and then you go home to tell somebody else about the meeting and you get them all wrong again.  Since the same generally goes for them with you, the whole thing is really a dazzling illusion. ...  The fact remains that getting people right is not what living is all about anyway.
