	    <![CDATA["Tightwaddery without creativity is deprivation.  When there is a lack of resourcefulness, inventiveness, and innovation, thrift means doing without.  When creativity combines with thrift you may be doing it without money, but you are not doing without." -- Amy Dacyczyn]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Sometimes, Laura World wasn't a realm of log cabins or prairies, it was a way of being.  Really, a way of being happy.  I wasn't into the flowery sayings, but I was nonetheless in love with the idea of serene rooms full of endless quiet and time, of sky in the windows, of a life comfortably cluttered and yet in some kind of perfect feng shui equilibrium, where all the days were capacious enough to bake bread and write novels and perambulate the wooded hills deep in thought (though truthfully, I'd allow for the occasional Rose-style cocktail party as well)." -- Wendy McClure]]>

	    <![CDATA["It was a vicious circle, though. The more gratification we found in our own geniuses, the more isolated we grew. Our home was like an artists' colony. We ate together, but otherwise were absorbed in our separate pursuits. And in this isolation, our creativity took on an aspect of compulsion." -- Alison Bechdel]]>
