	    <![CDATA["A mother's love for her child is like nothing else in the world. It knows no law, no pity. It dares all things and crushes down remorselessly all that stands in its path. 

&lt;i&gt;-The Last Seance (from The Hound of Death and Other Stories, also Double Sin and Other Stories)&lt;/i&gt;" -- Agatha Christie]]>

	    <![CDATA["Disturb us, Lord, when we are too well pleased with ourselves,  
when our dreams have come true because we have dreamed too little,  
when we arrive safely because we sailed too close to the shore.  

Disturb us, Lord, when with the abundance of things we possess, 
we have lost our thirst for the waters of life,  having fallen in love with life, we have ceased to dream of eternity,  and in our efforts to build a new earth,  
we have allowed our vision of the new heaven to dim.  

Disturb us, Lord, to dare more boldly, to venture on wider seas,  where storms will show your mastery,  where losing sight of land, we shall find the stars.  We ask you to push back the horizon of our hopes,  and to push us into the future in strength, courage, hope, and love.  This we ask in the name of our Captain, who is Jesus Christ. " -- Sir Francis Drake]]>

	    <![CDATA["If indeed it's a race
Then the chicks do the most
It isn't a brag
Or an estrogen boast
It's the women who've led me
With big open hearts
If not for their love
I'd have failed at the start.
And it's not just the mothers
I speak of them ALL
It's a woman there first 
When somebody falls.

The multi of tasking
That's easy to tease
I dare a great man
To try it all, PLEASE!
So this is my shout out
My rallying cry
To women all over
I hold you up high
And though there are others
Who'll think this poem strange
It's the women who plant
The root of big change." -- Jamie Lee Curtis]]>
