		<description>
	    <![CDATA["You killed them, Reuben.  You killed them in their sins!  You terminated their destiny on this earth.  You snatched from them any chance for repentance, for redemption.  You took that from them.  You took it all, Reuben.  You snuffed out forever the years of reparation they might have lived!  You took life itself from them and you took it from their descendants, and yes, even from their victims, you took what their amends might have been." -- Anne Rice]]>
