		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Life will break you. Nobody can protect you from that, and living alone won't either, for solitude will also break you with its yearning. You have to love. You have to feel. It is the reason you are here on earth. You are here to risk your heart. You are here to be swallowed up. And when it happens that you are broken, or betrayed, or left, or hurt, or death brushes near, let yourself sit by an apple tree and listen to the apples falling all around you in heaps, wasting their sweetness. Tell yourself you tasted as many as you could." -- Louise Erdrich]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["You can, in short, lead the life of the mind, which is, despite some appalling frustrations, the happiest life on earth.  And one day, in the thick of this, approaching some partial vision, you will (I swear) find yourself on the receiving end of - of all things - an &quot;idea for a story,&quot; and you will, God save you, start thinking about writing some fiction of your own.  Then you will understand, in what I fancy might be a blinding flash, that all this passionate thinking is what fiction is about, that all those other fiction writers started as you did, and are laborers in the same vineyard." -- Annie Dillard]]>

	    <![CDATA["I am a Jane Austenite, and therefore slightly imbecile about [author:Jane Austen|1265]. My fatuous expression, and airs of personal immunity—how ill they sit on the face, say, of a Stevensonian! But Jane Austen is so different. She is my favourite author! I read and reread, the mouth open and the mind closed.  Shut up in measureless content, I greet her by the name of most kind hostess, while criticism slumbers." -- E. M. Forster]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["One of the things I know about writing is this:  spend it all, shoot it, play it, lose it, all, right away, every time.  Do not hoard what seems good for a later place in the book or for another book; give it, give it all, give it now.  The impulse to save something good for a better place later is the signal to spend it now.  Something more will arise for later, something better. These things fill from behind, from beneath, like well water. Similarly, the impulse to keep to yourself what you have learned is not only shameful, it is destructive. Anything you do not give freely and abundantly becomes lost to you. You open your safe and find ashes." -- Annie Dillard]]>
