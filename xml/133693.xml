		<description>
	    <![CDATA["There are obviously two educations. One should teach us how to make a living and the other how to live. Surely these should never be confused in the mind of any man who has the slightest inkling of what culture is. For most of us it is essential that we should make a living...In the complications of modern life and with our increased accumulation of knowledge, it doubtless helps greatly to compress some years of experience into far fewer years by studying for a particular trade or profession in an institution; but that fact should not blind us to anotherâ€”namely, that in so doing we are learning a trade or a profession, but are not getting a liberal education as human beings." -- James Truslow Adams]]>
