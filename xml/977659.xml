		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Perhaps the greatest charity comes when we are kind to each other, when we don’t judge or categorize someone else, when we simply give each other the benefit of the doubt or remain quiet. Charity is accepting someone’s differences, weaknesses, and shortcomings; having patience with someone who has let us down; or resisting the impulse to become offended when someone doesn’t handle something the way we might have hoped. Charity is refusing to take advantage of another’s weakness and being willing to forgive someone who has hurt us. Charity is expecting the best of each other" -- Marvin J. Ashton]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I believed that books might save him because I knew they had so far, and because I knew the people books had saved.  They were college professors and actors and scientists and poets.  They got to college and sat on dorm floors drinking coffee, amazed they'd finally found their soul mates.  They always dressed a little out of season.  Their names were enshrined on the pink cards in the pockets of all the forgotten hardbacks in every library basement in America.  If the librarians were lazy enough or nostalgic enough or smart enough, those names would stay there forever." -- Rebecca Makkai]]>

	    <![CDATA["no, no, it's not all random, if it really was all random, the universe would abandon us completely. and the universe doesn't. it takes care of its most fragile creations in ways we can't see. like with parents who adore you blindly. and a big sister who feels guilty for being human over you. and a little gravelly-voiced kid whose friends have left him over you. and even a pink-haired girl who carries your picture in her wallet. maybe it is a lottery, but the universe makes it all even out in the end. the universe takes care of all its birds." -- R.J.

	    <![CDATA["...we should be remembered for the things we do. The things we do are the most important things of all. They are more important than what we say or what we look like. The things we do outlast our mortality. The things we do are like monuments that people build to honour heroes after they've died. They're like the pyramids that the Egyptians built to honour the Pharaohs. Only instead of being made out of stone, they're made out of the memories people have of you. That's why your deeds are like your monuments. Built with memories instead of with stone." -- RJ Palacio]]>

“Loads more than I do,” said Ron, shaking his head.
“But why’s she got to go to the library?”
“Because that’s what Hermione does,” said Ron, shrugging. “When in doubt, go to the library." -- J.K. Rowling]]>
