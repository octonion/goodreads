	    <![CDATA["Next thing you know she'll be on the bus and selling T-shirts in the parking lot, showing off her boobs to get in the stage door.&quot;

&quot;At least she has boobs to show,&quot; Jess said.

&quot;I have boobs,&quot; Chloe said, pointing to her chest.  &quot;Just because they're not weighing me down doesn't mean they're not substantial.&quot;

&quot;Okay, B cup,&quot; Jess said, taking a sip of her drink.

&quot;I have boobs!&quot; Chloe said again, a bit too loudly--she'd already had a couple of minibottles at the Spot.  &quot;My boobs are great, goddammit.  You know that?  They're fantastic!  My boobs are amazing." -- Sarah Dessen]]>
