		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Our lack of community is intensely painful.  A TV talk show is not community.  A couple of hours in a church pew each Sabbath is not community.  A multinational corporation is neither a human nor a community, and in the sweatshops, defiled agribusiness fields, genetic mutation labs, ecological dead zones, the inhumanity is showing.  Without genuine spiritual community, life becomes a struggle so lonely and grim that even Hillary Clinton has admitted &quot;it takes a village&quot;." -- David James Duncan]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["the only unfailing guide I’ve ever found through the innumerable blind alleys of my life as a writer, man, husband, father, citizen, steward, or believer, is the love burning in my heart. for me, prayer is about one thing: making contact with that love. though it burns in there like a candle flame, hot, bright, beautiful, love’s flame is so fragile… keeping one’s love burning, and living in accord with that burning: this, to me, is prayer." -- David James Duncan]]>
