	    <![CDATA["What we hunger for perhaps more than anything else is to be known in our full humanness, and yet that is often just what we also fear more than anything else.  It is important to tell at least from time to time the secret of who we truly and fully are . . . because otherwise we run the risk of losing track of who we truly and fully are and little by little come to accept instead the highly edited version which we put forth in hope that the world will find it more acceptable than the real thing.  It is important to tell our secrets too because it makes it easier . . . for other people to tell us a secret or two of their own . . .     " -- Frederick Buechner]]>

	    <![CDATA["Stop trying to protect, to rescue, to judge, to manage the lives around you . . . remember that the lives of others are not your business.  They are their business.  They are God’s business . . . even your own life is not your business.  It also is God’s business.  Leave it to God.  It is an astonishing thought.  It can become a life-transforming thought . . . unclench the fists of your spirit and take it easy . . . What deadens us most to God’s presence within us, I think, is the inner dialogue that we are continuously engaged in with ourselves, the endless chatter of human thought.  I suspect that there is nothing more crucial to true spiritual comfort . . . than being able from time to time to stop that chatter . . . " -- Frederick Buechner]]>
