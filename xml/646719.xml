		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["It is an old and wise caution, that when our neighbor's house is on fire, we ought to take care of our own.  For tho', blessed be God, I live in a government where liberty is well understood, and freely enjoy'd; yet experience has shown us all that bad precedent in one government is soon set up for an authority in another; and therefore I cannot but think it mine, and every honest man's duty that we ought at the same time to be upon our guard against power, wherever we apprehend that it may affect ourselves or our fellow subjects.
I should think it my duty, if required, to go to the utmost part of the land, where my service could be of any use in assisting to quench the flame of prosecutions upon informations, set on foot by the government, to deprive a people of their right to remonstrating (and complaining too) of the arbitrary attempts of men in power." -- Andrew Hamilton]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["It is now no more that toleration is spoken of, as if it was by the indulgence of one class of people, that another enjoyed the exercise of their inherent natural rights.  For happily the government of the United States, which gives to bigotry no sanction - to persecution no assistance, requires only that they who live under its protection should demean themselves as good citizens." -- George Washington]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I'm still agnostic.  But in the words of Elton Richards, I'm now a reverant agnostic.  Which isn't an oxymoron, I swear.  I now believe that whether or not there's a God, there is such a thing as sacredness.  Life is sacred.  The Sabbath can be a sacred day.  Prayer can be a sacred ritual.  There is something transcendent, beyond the everyday.  It's possible that humans created this sacredness ourselves, but that doesn't take away from its power or importance." -- A.J. Jacobs]]>
