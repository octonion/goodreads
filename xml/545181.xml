		<description>
	    <![CDATA["All you want is to be happy.  All your desires, whatever they may be, are longing for happiness.  Basically, you wish yourself well...desire by itself is not wrong.  It is life itself, the urge to grow in knowledge and experience.  It is choices you make that are wrong.  To imagine that some little thing-food, sex, power, fame-will make you happy is to decieve oneself.  Only something as vast and deep as your real self can make you truly and lastingly happy." -- Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj]]>
