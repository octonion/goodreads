	    <![CDATA["Niall had been able to mask the odor of fairy from Eric in the restaurant, but I saw from the flare of Eric's nostrils that the intoxicating scent clung to me. Eric's eyes closed in ecstasy, and he actually licked his lips. I felt like a T-bone just out of reach of a hungry dog. 
&quot;Snap out of it,&quot; I said. I wasn't in the mood.
With a huge effort, Eric reigned himself in. &quot;When you smell like that,&quot; he said, &quot;I just wanna fuck you and bite you and rub myself all over you." -- Charlaine Harris]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Back in August, I wrote a post about the supposed race to the bottom with ebooks, refuting some nonsense written by an establishment bonehead.

This meme won't die. People are still convinced that new ebooks are going to be priced at ten cents, and writers will starve, and this will cause a second Great Depression where banks will close and people will be forced to buy Kindles with food stamps, and then the earth will enter another ice age where all the bunnies will freeze to death." -- J.A.
