	    <![CDATA["Peaches and Cheese”:

&lt;i&gt;The vagabond sun winks down through the trees,
While lilacs, like memories, waft on the breeze,
My friend, I was born for days such as these,
To inhale perfume,
And cut through the gloom,
And feast like a king upon peaches and cheese!
I’ll travel this wide world and go where I please,
Can’t stop my wand’ring, it’s like a disease.
My only regret as I cross the high seas:
What I leave behind,
Though I hope to find,
My own golden city of peaches and cheese!&lt;/i&gt;" -- Rachel Hartman]]>

&quot;Yes,&quot; Mars said. &quot;Is that not clear?&quot;
&quot;Well, my lord...usually prophecies are unclear. They're wrapped in riddles. They rhyme, and...&quot;
