		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["In India, I was living in a little hut, about six feet by seven feet. It had a canvas flap instead of a door.  I was sitting on my bed meditating, and a cat wandered in and plopped down on my lap.  I took the cat and tossed it out the door.  Ten seconds later it was back on my lap.  We got into a sort of dance, this cat and I...I tossed it out because I was trying to meditate, to get enlightened.  But the cat kept returning.  I was getting more and more irritated, more and more annoyed with the persistence of the cat.  Finally, after about a half-hour of this coming in and tossing out, I had to surrender.  There was nothing else to do.  There was no way to block off the door.  I sat there, the cat came back in, and it got on my lap.  But I did not do anything.  I just let go.  Thirty seconds later the cat got up and walked out.  So, you see, our teachers come in many forms." -- Joseph Goldstein]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["There are times, however, and this is one of them, when even being right feels wrong. What do you say, for instance, about a generation that has been taught that rain is poison and sex is death? If making love might be fatal and if a cool spring breeze on any summer afternoon can turn a crystal blue lake into a puddle of black poison right in front of your eyes, there is not much left except TV and relentless masturbation. It's a strange world. Some people get rich and others eat shit and die." -- Hunter S. Thompson]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["A writer who writes, ''I am alone''... can be considered rather comical. It is comical for a man to recognize his solitude by addressing a reader and by using methods that prevent the individual from being alone. The word alone is just as general as the word bread. To pronounce it is to summon to oneself the presence of everything the word excludes." -- Maurice Blanchot]]>
