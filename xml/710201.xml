		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Religious people tend to encounter, among those who are not, a cemented certainty that belief in God is a crutch for the weak and the fearful...Now the belief in God may turn out at the last trump to be a mistake. Meantime, let us be quite clear, it is not merely the comfort of the simple--though it is that too, much to its glory--it is a formidable intellectual position with which most of the first-class minds of the human race, century in and century out, have concurred, each in his own way....speaking of crutches--Freud can be a crutch, Marx can be a crutch, rationalism can be a crutch, and atheism can be two canes and a pair of iron braces. We none of us have all the answers, nor are we likely to have. But in the country of the halt, the man who is surest he has no limp may be the worst-crippled." -- Herman Wouk]]>

	    <![CDATA["The man who lives in a small community lives in a much larger world. He knows much more of the fierce variety and uncompromising divergences of menâ€¦In a large community, we can choose our companions. In a small community, our companions are chosen for us. Thus in all extensive and highly civilized society groups come into existence founded upon sympathy, and shut out the real world more sharply than the gates of a monastery. There is nothing really narrow about the clan; the thing which is really narrow is the clique." -- G.K. Chesterton]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["England and the English governing class never did call on this absurd deity of race until it seemed, for an instant, that they had no other god to call onâ€¦ the truth of the whole matter is very simple. Nationality exists, and has nothing in the world to do with race. Nationality is a thing like a church or a secret society. It is the product of the human soul and will; it is a spiritual product. And there are menâ€¦ who would think anything and do anything rather than admit anything could be a spiritual product." -- G.K. Chesterton]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The modern world is not evil; in some ways the modern world is far too good. It is full of wild and wasted virtues. When a religious scheme is shattered...it is not merely the vices that are let loose. The vices are, indeed, let loose, and they wander and do damage. But the virtues are let loose also; and the virtues wander more wildly, and the virtues do more terrible damage. The modern world is full of the old Christian virtues gone mad. The virtues have gone mad because they have been isolated from each other and are wandering alone. Thus some scientists care for truth; and their truth is pitiless. Thus some humanitarians only care for pity; and their pity (I am sorry to say) is often untruthful." -- G.K. Chesterton]]>

	    <![CDATA["[M]an has been accustomed, ever since he was a boy, to having a dozen incompatible philosophies dancing about together inside his head. He doesn't think of doctrines as primarily &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false,&quot; but as &quot;academic&quot; or &quot;practical,&quot; &quot;outworn&quot; or &quot;contemporary,&quot; &quot;conventional&quot; or &quot;ruthless.&quot; Jargon, not argument, is your best ally in keeping him from the Church. Don't waste time trying to make him think that materialism is true! Make him think it is strong or stark or courageousâ€”that it is the philosophy of the future. That's the sort of thing he cares about." -- C.S. Lewis]]>

	    <![CDATA["A man who says that no patriot should attack the [war] until it is over is not worth answering intelligently; he is saying that no good son should warn his mother off a cliff until she has fallen over it. But there is an anti-patriot who honestly angers honest menâ€¦he is the uncandid candid friend; the man who says, &quot;I am sorry to say we are ruined,&quot; and is not sorry at allâ€¦Granted that he states only facts, it is still essential to know what are his emotions, what is his motive. It may be that twelve hundred men in Tottenham are down with smallpox; but we want to know whether this is stated by some great philosopher who wants to curse the gods, or only by some common clergyman who wants to help the men." -- G.K.
