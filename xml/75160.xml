		<description>
	    <![CDATA["When you look at what C.S. Lewis is saying, his message is so anti-life, so cruel, so unjust. The view that the Narnia books have for the material world is one of almost undisguised contempt. At one point, the old professor says, ‘It’s all in Plato’ — meaning that the physical world we see around us is the crude, shabby, imperfect, second-rate copy of something much better. I want to emphasize the simple physical truth of things, the absolute primacy of the material life, rather than the spiritual or the afterlife.

[&lt;i&gt;The New York Times interview, 2000&lt;/i&gt;]" -- Philip Pullman]]>

	    <![CDATA["[&lt;i&gt;Responding to the Bishop of Oxford, Samuel Wilberforce's question whether he traced his descent from an ape on his mother's or his father's side&lt;/i&gt;]

A man has no reason to be ashamed of having an ape for his grandfather. If there were an ancestor whom I should feel shame in recalling it would rather be a &lt;i&gt;man&lt;/i&gt;—a man of restless and versatile intellect—who … plunges into scientific questions with which he has no real acquaintance, only to obscure them by an aimless rhetoric, and distract the attention of his hearers from the real point at issue by eloquent digressions and skilled appeals to religious prejudice." -- Thomas Huxley]]>

We can't even talk about that. And then he stuffs them back, dirty, tangled and torn. It's up to you to do the stitching.
