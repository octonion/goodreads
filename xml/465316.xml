	    <![CDATA["Every one of Joel's important songs--including the happy ones--are ultimately about loneliness. And it's not 'clever lonely' (like Morrissey) or 'interesting lonely' (like Radiohead); it's 'lonely lonely,' like the way it feels when you're being hugged by someone and it somehow makes you sadder." -- Chuck Klosterman]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["If you define your personality as creative, it only means you understand what is &lt;i&gt;perceived&lt;/i&gt; to be creative by the world at large, so you're really just following a rote creative template. That's the &lt;i&gt;opposite&lt;/i&gt; of creativity. Everybody is wrong about everything, just about all the time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But ANYWAY..." -- Chuck Klosterman]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Live a good life. If there are gods and they are just, then they will not care how devout you have been, but will welcome you based on the virtues you have lived by. If there are gods, but unjust, then you should not want to worship them. If there are no gods, then you will be gone, but will have lived a noble life that will live on in the memories of your loved ones." -- Anonymous]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["A noble man compares and estimates himself by an idea which is higher than himself; and a mean man, by one lower than himself. The one produces aspiration; the other ambition, which is the way in which a vulgar man aspires." -- Marcus Aurelius]]>
