	    <![CDATA["Not only will you sleep with me, but you will say 'please.'&quot;
I stared at him, shocked. 
The smile widened. &quot;You will say 'please' before and 'thank you' after.&quot; 
Nervous laughter bubbled up. &quot;You've gone insane. All that peroxide in your hair finally did your brain in, Goldilocks." -- Ilona Andrews]]>

	    <![CDATA["You had two prerequisites.” Regin plopped down on a snowbank. “And I do believe I have Russian ex-mil contacts, and I speak the language-“
“Oh, come on! I’ve since learned that you do not by any stretch. You think Dostoyevsky is Russian for ‘How ‘s it hanging?’”
She blinked up at Kaderin as she paced by. “Then how do you say it?”
“I-don’t-know.”
“Then how do you know it’s not Dostoyevsky? No. Really.” She blew a bubble with her gum – possibly the first to do so at this location – but it flash-froze, and she had to crunch it back to gum consistency with her molars. “Obi-Wan, I was your only hope.”
(Kaderin and Regin)" -- Kresley Cole]]>
