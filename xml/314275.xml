		<description>
	    <![CDATA["There is within us a fundamental dis-ease, an unquenchable fire that renders us incapable, in this life, of ever coming to full peace. This desire lies at the center of our lives, in the marrow of our bones, and in the deep recesses of the soul. At the heart of all great literature, poetry, art, philosophy, psychology, and religion lies the naming and analyzing of this desire. Spirituality is, ultimately, about what we do with that desire. What we do with our longings, both in terms of handling the pain and the hope they bring us, that is our spirituality . . . Augustine says: ‘You have made us for yourself, Lord, and our hearts are restless until they rest in you.’ Spirituality is about what we do with our unrest." -- Ronald Rolheiser]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["As a Christian and a feminist, the most important message I can carry and fight for is the sacredness of each human life, and reproductive rights for all women are a crucial part of that. It is a moral necessity that we not be forced to bring children into the world for whom we cannot be responsible and adoring and present. We must not inflict life on children who will be resented; we must not inflict unwanted children on society." -- Anne Lamott]]>

	    <![CDATA["livid, &lt;i&gt;adj.&lt;/i&gt;

Fuck You for cheating on me.  Fuck you for reducing it to the word cheating.  As if this were a card game, and you sneaked a look at my hand.  Who came up with the term &lt;i&gt;cheating,&lt;/i&gt; anyway?  A cheater, I imagine.  Someone who thought &lt;i&gt;liar&lt;/i&gt; was too harsh.  Someone who thought &lt;i&gt;devastator&lt;/i&gt; was too emotional.  The same person who thought, oops, he’d gotten &lt;i&gt;caught with his hand in the cookie jar.&lt;/i&gt;  Fuck you.  This isn’t about slipping yourself an extra twenty dollars of Monopoly money.  These are our lives.  You went and broke our lives.  You are so much worse than a cheater.  You killed something.  And you killed it when its back was turned." -- David Levithan]]>
