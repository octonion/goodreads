	    <![CDATA["But there are people who take salt with their coffee.  They say it gives a tang, a savour, which is peculiar and fascinating.  In the same way there are certain places, surrounded by a halo of romance, to which the inevitable disillusionment you experience on seeing them gives a singular spice.  You had expected something wholly beautiful and you get an impression which is infinitely more complicated than any that beauty can give you.  It is the weakness in the character of a great man which may make him less admirable but certainly more interesting.  

Nothing had prepared me for Honolulu..." -- W. Somerset Maugham]]>
