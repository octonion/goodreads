	    <![CDATA["I thought about how odd it is for billions of people to be alive, yet not one of them is really quite sure of what makes people people.

That's not much, considering how special we seem to think we are." -- Douglas Coupland]]>

	    <![CDATA["If you do follow your bliss you put yourself on a kind of track that has been there all the while, waiting for you, and the life that you ought to be living is the one you are living. Follow your bliss and don't be afraid, and doors will open where you didn't know they were going to be." -- Joseph Campbell]]>
