	    <![CDATA["In an age when mass pleasures like television are becoming more feeble and homogeneous, the very act of discrimination becomes a form of protest. At a time when mass marketing of food produces a product so disgusting that it has to be wrapped in distracting gimmicks to be sold, the mere fact of paying attention to what you eat and drink and telling the truth about taste is a revolutionary act." -- Lynn Hoffman]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["They (penguins) then fall madly in love and live happily ever after.
-
And so you ask yourself: &quot;If a penguin can have a worthwhile, stimulating relationship, why the hell can't I?&quot;
-
Or maybe you ask yourself: &quot;Would I be happier if I started dating a penguin" -- Bradley Trevor Greive]]>

	    <![CDATA["I suppose he could have changed,&quot; Neal said dryly. &quot;I myself have noticed my growing resemblance to a daffodil.&quot; The other pages snorted. 

Kel eyed her friend. &quot;You do look yellow around the edges,&quot; she told him, her face quite serious. &quot;I hadnâ€™t wanted to bring it up.&quot; 

&quot;We daffodils like to have things brought up,&quot; Neal said, slinging an arm around her shoulders. &quot;It reminds us of spring." -- Tamora Pierce (Page) ]]>

	    <![CDATA["A Kiss,&quot; said Mogget sleepily. &quot;Actually, just a breath would do. But you have to start kissing someone sometime, I suppose.&quot;
&quot;A breath?&quot; she asked. She didn't want to kiss just any wooden man. He looked nice enough, but he might not be like his looks. A kiss seemed too forward." -- Garth Nix]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Lucky Charms are like the vampires of breakfast cereal. They're magical, they're delicious, they're a little bit dangerous and bad for you. They initially make you feel great, but then over time you realize that maybe your relationship with Lucky Charms is just a little bit unhealthy and you start to think, 'Maybe I don't want to be in a long-term relationship with a breakfast cereal that tastes delicious but damages my health.' But then the Lucky Charms gets all stalker on you and for some reason you kind of like that. It makes you feel special. So yeah, you spend your life with Lucky Charms. That's awesome. That's a great way to... get diabetes." -- John Green]]>
