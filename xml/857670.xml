		<description>
	    <![CDATA["All morning I struggled with the sensation of stray wisps of one world seeping through the cracks of another. Do you know the feeling when you start reading a new book before the membrane of the last one has had time to close behind you?  You leave the previous book with ideas and themes -- characters even -- caught in the fibers of your clothes, and when you open the new book, they are still with you." -- Diane Setterfield]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Oh, magic hour when a child first knows it can read printed words!  

For quite a while, Francie had been spelling out letters, sounding them and then putting the sounds together to mean a word.  But, one day, she looked at a page and the word &quot;mouse&quot; had instantaneous meaning.  She looked at the word, and a picture of a gray mouse scampered through her mind.  She looked further and when she saw &quot;horse,&quot; she heard him pawing the ground and saw the sun glint on his glossy coat.  The word &quot;running&quot; hit her suddenly and she breathed hard as though running herself.  The barrier between he individual sound of each letter and the whole meaning of the word was removed and the printed word meant a thing at one quick glance.  She read a few pages rapidly and almost became ill with excitement.  She wanted to shout it out.  She could read!  She could read!

From that time on, the world was hers for the reading.  She would never be lonely again, never miss the lack of intimate friends.  Books became her friends and there was one for every mood.  There was poetry for quiet companionship.  There was adventure when she tired of quiet hours.  There would be love stories when she came to adolescence and when she wanted to feel a closeness to someone she could read a biography.  On that day when she first knew she could read, she made a vow to read one book a day as long as she lived." -- Betty  Smith]]>

	    <![CDATA["There's a Spanish proverb,&quot; he said, &quot;that's always fascinated me. &quot;Take what you want and pay for it, says God.'&quot; &quot;I don't believe in God,&quot; Daniel said, &quot;but that principle seems, to me, to have a divinity of its own; a kind of blazing purity.  What could be simpler, or more crucial? You can have anything you want, as long as you accept that there is a price and that you will have to pay it." -- Tana French]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I have come to the frightening conclusion that I am the decisive element. It is my personal approach that creates the climate. It is my daily mood that makes the weather. I possess tremendous power to make life miserable or joyous. I can be a tool of torture or an instrument of inspiration, I can humiliate or humor, hurt or heal. In all situations, it is my response that decides whether a crisis is escalated or de-escalated, and a person is humanized or de-humanized. If we treat people as they are, we make them worse. If we treat people as they ought to be, we help them become what they are capable of becoming." -- Haim G. Ginott]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["In our twenties, when there is still so much time ahead of us, time that seems ample for a hundred indecisions, for a hundred visions and revisions—we draw a card, and we must decide right then and there whether to keep that card and discard the next, or discard the first card and keep the second. And before we know it, the deck has been played out and the decisions we have just made will shape our lives for decades to come." -- Amor Towles]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["A book, being a physical object, engenders a certain respect that zipping electrons cannot. Because you cannot turn a book off, because you have to hold it in your hands, because a book sits there, waiting for you, whether you think you want it or not, because of all these things, a book is a friend. It’s not just the content, but the physical being of a book that is there for you always and unconditionally." -- Mo Willems]]>
