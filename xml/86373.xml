		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The thing to remember about love affairs,&quot; says Simone, &quot;is that they are all like having raccoons in your chimney.&quot;
...

We have raccoons sometimes in our chimney,&quot; explains Simone.
And once we tried to smoke them out. We lit a fire, knowing they were there, but we hoped the smoke would cause them to scurry out the top and never come back. Instead, they caught on fire and came crashing down into our living room, all charred and in flames and running madly around until they dropped dead.&quot; Simone swallows some wine. &quot;Love affairs are like that,&quot; she says. &quot;They are all like that." -- Lorrie Moore]]>

	    <![CDATA["They were things for which it was impossible to prepare but which one spent a lifetime looking back at, trying to accept, interpret, comprehend. Things that should never have happened, that seemed out of place and wrong, these were what prevailed, what endured, in the end." -- Jhumpa Lahiri]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["There was an enjoyment to being alive, he felt, that because of an underlying meaninglessness–like how a person alone for too long cannot feel comfortable when with others; cannot neglect that underlying the feeling of belongingness is the certainty, really, of loneliness, and nothingness, and so experiences life in that hurried, worthless way one experiences a mistake–he could no longer get at." -- Tao Lin]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["A world without right or wrong was a world that did not want itself, anything other than itself, or anything not those two things, but that still wanted something.  A world without right or wrong invited you over, complained about you, and gave you cookies.  Don't leave, it said, and gave you a vegan cookie.  It avoided eye contact, but touched your knee sometimes.  It was the world without right or wrong.  It didn't have any meaning.  It just wanted a little meaning." -- Tao Lin]]>

	    <![CDATA["They wordlessly excused each other for not loving each other as much as they had planned to.  There were empty rooms in the house where they had meant to put their love, and they worked together to fill these rooms with midcentury modern furniture.

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["But then his parents changed. A year of California had changed them. They stopped sending money. Greg was forced to go out into the world, to interact with real people. And he was glad of this. He had always wanted to be a normal person. To be at ease in society. He had just been too scared to try. But now he was forced to, and so he did–he went and got a job at the public library. He was not quite a librarian, but close. Greg was a shelver. There would be carts of books to shelve, then there would be no more carts of books to shelve, then there would be carts of books to shelve.

As a shelver, Greg felt that life was passing him by in a slow and distant, but massive, way–like the moon." -- Tao Lin]]>

	    <![CDATA["Anyone whose goal is 'something higher' must expect someday to suffer vertigo. What is vertigo? Fear of falling? No, Vertigo is something other than fear of falling. It is the voice of the emptiness below us which tempts and lures us, it is the desire to fall, against which, terrified, we defend ourselves." -- Milan Kundera]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["And on the subject of burning books: I want to congratulate librarians, not famous for their physical strength or their powerful political connections or their great wealth, who, all over this country, have staunchly resisted anti-democratic bullies who have tried to remove certain books from their shelves, and have refused to reveal to thought police the names of persons who have checked out those titles.

So the America I loved still exists, if not in the White House or the Supreme Court or the Senate or the House of Representatives or the media. The America I love still exists at the front desks of our public libraries." -- Kurt Vonnegut]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["If you're 50 years old or younger, give every book about 50 pages before you decide to commit yourself to reading it, or give it up.

If you're over 50, which is when time gets shorter, subtract your age from 100 - the result is the number of pages you should read before deciding whether or not to quit. If you're 100 or over you get to judge the book by its cover, despite the dangers in doing so." -- Nancy Pearl]]>

You wonder when your turn is going to be, or if it's already happened." -- Douglas Coupland]]>
