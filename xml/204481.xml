		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I leave Sisyphus at the foot of the mountain. One always finds one's burden again. But Sisyphus teaches the higher fidelity that negates the gods and raises rocks. He too concludes that all is well. This universe henceforth without a master seems to him neither sterile nor futile. Each atom of that stone, each mineral flake of that night-filled mountain, in itself, forms a world. The struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a man's heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy." -- Albert Camus]]>

	    <![CDATA["Together they had overcome the daily incomprehension, the instantaneous hatred, the reciprocal nastiness, and fabulous flashes of glory in the conjugal conspiracy. It was time when they both loved each other best, without hurry or excess, when both were most conscious of and grateful for their incredible victories over adversity. Life would still present them with other moral trials, of course, but that no longer mattered: they were on the other shore." -- Gabriel García Márquez]]>

	    <![CDATA["There is a loneliness that can be rocked.  Arms crossed, knees drawn up, holding, holding on, this motion, unlike a ship's, smooths and contains the rocker.  It's an inside kind--wrapped tight like skin.  Then there is the loneliness that roams.  No rocking can hold it down.  It is alive.  On its own.  A dry and spreading thing that makes the sound of one's own feet going seem to come from a far-off place." -- Toni Morrison]]>

And while men admire the quality of the first they love the produce of the second." -- John Steinbeck]]>
