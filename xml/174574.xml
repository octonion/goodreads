		<description>
	    <![CDATA["When we honestly ask ourselves which person in our lives mean the most to us, we often find that it is those who, instead of giving advice, solutions, or cures, have chosen rather to share our pain and touch our wounds with a warm and tender hand. The friend who can be silent with us in a moment of despair or confusion, who can stay with us in an hour of grief and bereavement, who can tolerate not knowing, not curing, not healing and face with us the reality of our powerlessness, that is a friend who cares." -- Henri Nouwen]]>

But no one of these hypotheses is more probable than any other: they lie outside the region of even probable knowledge, and therefore there is no reason to consider any of them." -- Bertrand Russell ]]>

And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do." -- Apple Computer Inc.]]>

	    <![CDATA["Nature loves courage. You make the commitment and nature will respond to that commitment by removing impossible obstacles. Dream the impossible dream and the world will not grind you under, it will lift you up. This is the trick. This is what all these teachers and philosophers who really counted, who really touched the alchemical gold, this is what they understood. This is the shamanic dance in the waterfall. This is how magic is done. By hurling yourself into the abyss and discovering its a feather bed." -- Terence McKenna]]>

We must decondition ourselves from 10,000 years of bad behavior. And, it's not easy." -- Terence McKenna]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["When we give our minds and our responsibility away, we give our lives away.  If enough of us do it, we give the world away and that is precisely what we have been doing throughout known human history.  This is why the few have always controlled the masses.  The only difference today is that the few are now manipulating the entire planet because of the globalisation of business, banking and communications.  The foundation of that control has always been the same : keep the people in ignorance, fear and at war with themselves,.  Divide, rule and conquer while keeping the most important knowledge to yourself." -- David Icke]]>

	    <![CDATA["The natural inclination of a child is to take pleasure in the use of the mind no less than of the body.  The child's primary business is learning.  It is also the primary entertainment.  To retain that orientation into adulthood, so that consciousness is not a burden but a joy, is the mark of the successfully developed human being." -- Nathaniel Branden]]>
