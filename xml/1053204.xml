	    <![CDATA["literature is a way in which we can learn to live deeper lives -- husband with wife, parent with child, brother with sister, fellow member with fellow member.  Most good authors are better than we are.  They are much better company than our own friends. 
 

What comes from good company?  What comes from good company is better manners, greater sensitivity, greater sensibility, greater empathy, great sympathy.  Reading good literature makes us more capable of understanding other people, of loving other people, those whom we don't particularly want to love, even our enemies, as well as those closest to us.  How can we expect to have full marriages when we are not going into those marriages with full minds and fine sensibilities?  We are ignoring the tremendous possibilities of a delicate, well-poised, rich, sensitive life if we ignore the literature of the past.  There is no substitute." -- Arthur Henry King]]>
