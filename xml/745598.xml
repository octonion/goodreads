	    <![CDATA["My particular dread--the vivid possibility that left me staring at tree shadows on the bedroom ceiling night after night--was having to lie in a small tent, alone in an inky wilderness, listening to a foraging bear outside and wondering what its intentions were.  I was especially riveted by an amateur photograph in Herrero's book, taken late at night by a camper with a flash at a campground out West.  The photograph caught four black bears as they puzzled over a suspended food bag.  The bears were clearly startled but not remotely alarmed by the flash.  It was not the size or demeanor of the bears that troubled me--they looked almost comically nonaggressive, like four guys who had gotten a Frisbee caught up a tree--but their numbers.  Up to that moment it had not occurred to me that bears might prowl in parties.  What on earth would I do if &lt;i&gt;four&lt;/i&gt; bears came into my camp?  Why, I would die, of course.  Literally shit myself lifeless.  I would blow my sphincter out my backside like one of those unrolling paper streamers you get at children's parties--I daresay it would even give a merry toot--and bleed to a messy death in my sleeping bag." -- Bill Bryson]]>
