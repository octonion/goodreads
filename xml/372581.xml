	    <![CDATA["...he said almost nothing, and ground his teeth against his desire to tell them the truth: God is helpless.  We are at the mercy of our own radical freedom, and all God can do is take into God's self the grief, the violence, the sublime acts of kindness, the good sex.  God comes to us from the future, and has only one godlike gift: the lure.  We are lured toward truth, beauty, and goodness...the lure is pulling at our hearts like some lucid joy inside every actual occasion and all we have to do is...Say yes." -- Haven Kimmel]]>

	    <![CDATA["...we have to surpass ourselves every day, make every day undying.  Climb our own personal Everest and do it in such a way that every step is a little bit of eternity.
     That's what the future is for: to build the present, with real plans, made by living people." -- Muriel Barbery]]>
