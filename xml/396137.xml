	    <![CDATA["Extinguish my eyes, I'll go on seeing you.
Seal my ears, I'll go on hearing you.
And without feet I can make my way to you,
without a mouth I can swear your name.

Break off my arms, I'll take hold of you
with my heart as with a hand.
Stop my heart, and my brain will start to beat.
And if you consume my brain with fire,
I'll feel you burn in every drop of my blood." -- Rainer Maria Rilke]]>

May you trust God that you are exactly where you are meant to be.  
 
May you not forget the infinite possibilities that are born of faith.  
 
May you use those gifts that you have received, and pass on the love that has been given to you.   

May you be content knowing you are a child of God. 

 Let this presence settle into your bones, and allow your soul the freedom to sing, dance, praise and love.   

It is there for each and every one of us." -- Teresa of Ávila]]>
