	    <![CDATA["You mustn’t wish for another life. You mustn’t want to be somebody else. What you must do is this:
“Rejoice evermore. 
Pray without ceasing.
 In everything give thanks.” 
I am not all the way capable of so much, but those are the right instructions." -- Wendell Berry]]>

	    <![CDATA["Her religious poetry was surprisingly slender, and as I was eager to know more about her religion, I asked her about this aspect of her poetry.  She replied with these lines from Keats' Ode to a Grecian Urn: 'Beauty is truth, truth beauty'--that is all Ye know on eath, and all ye need to know'.  Do not ask me to immortalise the great Mystery of Life.  I am just a humble worker.  For beauty, look to the Pslams, to Isaiah, to St. John of the Cross.  How could my poor pen scan such verse? For truth, look to the Gospels-- four short accounts of God made Man. There is nothing more to say." -- Jennifer Worth]]>

	    <![CDATA["Their devotion showed me there were no versions of love there was only... Love. That it had no equal and that it was worth searching for, even if that search took a lifetime." -- Jennifer Worth]]>
