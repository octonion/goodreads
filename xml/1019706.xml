		<description>
	    <![CDATA["A final caution to students:  in making judgments on literature, always be honest.  Do not pretend to like what you really do not like.  Do not be afraid to admit a liking for what you do like.  A genuine enthusiasm for the second-rate is much better than false enthusiasm or no enthusiasm at all.  Be neither hasty nor timorous in making your judgments.  When you have attentively read a poem and thoroughly considered it, decide what you think.  Do not hedge, equivocate, or try to find out others' opinions before forming your own.  But having formed an opinion and expressed it, do not allow it to petrify.  Compare your opinion then with the opinions of others; allow yourself to change it when convinced of its error:  in this way you learn.  Honestly, courage, and humility are the necessary moral foundations for all genuine literary judgment." -- Laurence Perrine]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Lord, make me an instrument of thy peace.
Where there is hatred, let me sow love,
Where there is injury, pardon;
Where there is doubt, faith;
Where there is despair, hope;
Where there is darkness, light;
And where there is sadness, joy.

O Divine Master, grant that I may not so much seek
  to be consoled as to console,
  to be understood as to understand,
  to be loved, as to love.

For it is in giving that we receive,
It is in pardoning that we are pardoned,
and it is in dying that we are born to eternal life." -- St. Francis of Assisi]]>

	    <![CDATA["The Paradoxical Commandments

People are illogical, unreasonable, and self-centered.
Love them anyway.

If you do good, people will accuse you of selfish ulterior motives.
Do good anyway.

If you are successful, you will win false friends and true enemies.
Succeed anyway.

The good you do today will be forgotten tomorrow.
Do good anyway.

Honesty and frankness make you vulnerable.
Be honest and frank anyway.

The biggest men and women with the biggest ideas can be shot down by the smallest men and women with the smallest minds.
Think big anyway.

People favor underdogs but follow only top dogs.
Fight for a few underdogs anyway.

What you spend years building may be destroyed overnight.
Build anyway.

People really need help but may attack you if you do help them.
Help people anyway.

Give the world the best you have and you'll get kicked in the teeth.
Give the world the best you have anyway." -- Kent M. Keith]]>

	    <![CDATA["Every life is different because you passed this way and touched history. Even the child Ruth May touched history. Everyone is complicit. The okapi complied by living, and the spider by dying. It would have lived if it could. Listen: being dead is not worse than being alive. It is different, though. You could say the view is larger." -- Barbara Kingsolver]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Life has little bits of magic at nearly every turn, if you're looking closely enough.  Scrapbooking has refined myselses.  it's made me hungry to use it before I lose it.  It's made me remember that I don't remember what it was like to be nine years old.  And that I will never live in a Pottery Barn house.  And that as tiny as I am in the scope of the universe, no one lives a life like mine.  Not even the people whose meals I cook, whose laundry I fold, and whose cheeks I kiss at night." -- Cathy Zielske]]>

That's how life is most of the time, isn't it? You know where you are and where you hope to wind up. It's the getting there that's challenging." -- Anna Quindlen]]>
