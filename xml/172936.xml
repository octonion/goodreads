	    <![CDATA["Love is a temporary madness. It erupts like an earthquake and then subsides. And when it subsides you have to make a decision. You have to work out whether your roots have become so entwined together that it is inconceivable that you should ever part. Because this is what love is. Love is not breathlessness, it is not excitement, it is not the promulgation of promises of eternal passion. That is just being &quot;in love&quot; which any of us can convince ourselves we are. Love itself is what is left over when being in love has burned away, and this is both an art and a fortunate accident. Your mother and I had it, we had roots that grew towards each other underground, and when all the pretty blossom had fallen from our branches we found that we were one tree and not two." -- Louis de Bernières]]>

	    <![CDATA["When God Created Mothers&quot;
  
When the Good Lord was creating mothers, He was into His sixth day of &quot;overtime&quot; when the angel appeared and said. &quot;You're doing a lot of fiddling around on this one.&quot; 

And God said, &quot;Have you read the specs on this order?&quot; She has to be completely washable, but not plastic. Have 180 moveable parts...all replaceable. Run on black coffee and leftovers. Have a lap that disappears when she stands up. A kiss that can cure anything from a broken leg to a disappointed love affair. And six pairs of hands.&quot; 

The angel shook her head slowly and said. &quot;Six pairs of hands.... no way.&quot; 

It's not the hands that are causing me problems,&quot; God remarked, &quot;it's the three pairs of eyes that mothers have to have.&quot; 

That's on the standard model?&quot; asked the angel. God nodded. 

One pair that sees through closed doors when she asks, 'What are you kids doing in there?' when she already knows. Another here in the back of her head that sees what she shouldn't but what she has to know, and of course the ones here in front that can look at a child when he goofs up and say. 'I understand and I love you' without so much as uttering a word.&quot; 

God,&quot; said the angel touching his sleeve gently, &quot;Get some rest tomorrow....&quot; 

I can't,&quot; said God, &quot;I'm so close to creating something so close to myself. Already I have one who heals herself when she is sick...can feed a family of six on one pound of hamburger...and can get a nine year old to stand under a shower.&quot; 

The angel circled the model of a mother very slowly. &quot;It's too soft,&quot; she sighed. 

But tough!&quot; said God excitedly. &quot;You can imagine what this mother can do or endure.&quot; 

Can it think?&quot; 

Not only can it think, but it can reason and compromise,&quot; said the Creator. 

Finally, the angel bent over and ran her finger across the cheek. 

There's a leak,&quot; she pronounced. &quot;I told You that You were trying to put too much into this model.&quot; 

It's not a leak,&quot; said the Lord, &quot;It's a tear.&quot; 

What's it for?&quot; 

It's for joy, sadness, disappointment, pain, loneliness, and pride.&quot; 

You are a genius, &quot; said the angel. 

Somberly, God said, &quot;I didn't put it there." -- Erma Bombeck]]>

	    <![CDATA["My point is, there are a lot of people in the world. No one ever sees everything the same way you do; it just doesn't happen. So when you find one person who gets a couple of things, especially if they're important ones... you might as well hold on to them. You know?" -- Sarah Dessen]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["What is family? They were the people who claimed you. In good, in bad, in parts or in whole, they were the ones who showed up, who stayed in there, regardless. It wasn't just about blood relations or shared chromosomes, but something wider, bigger. We had many families over time. Our family of origin, the family we created, and the groups you moved through while all of this was happening: friends, lovers, sometimes even strangers. None of them perfect, and we couldn't expect them to be. You can't make any one person your world. The trick was to take what each could give you and build your world from it." -- Sarah Dessen]]>

	    <![CDATA["This life is what you make it. No matter what, you're going to mess up sometimes, it's a universal truth. But the good part is you get to decide how you're going to mess it up. Girls will be your friends - they'll act like it anyway. But just remember, some come, some go. The ones that stay with you through everything - they're your true best friends. Don't let go of them. Also remember, sisters make the best friends in the world. As for lovers, well, they'll come and go too. And baby, I hate to say it, most of them - actually pretty much all of them are going to break your heart, but you can't give up because if you give up, you'll never find your soulmate. You'll never find that half who makes you whole and that goes for everything. Just because you fail once, doesn't mean you're gonna fail at everything. Keep trying, hold on, and always, always, always believe in yourself, because if you don't, then who will, sweetie? So keep your head high, keep your chin up, and most importantly, keep smiling, because life's a beautiful thing and there's so much to smile about." -- Marilyn Monroe]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["You may not be her first, her last, or her only. She loved before she may love again. But if she loves you now, what else matters? She's not perfect—you aren't either, and the two of you may never be perfect together but if she can make you laugh, cause you to think twice, and admit to being human and making mistakes, hold onto her and give her the most you can. She may not be thinking about you every second of the day, but she will give you a part of her that she knows you can break—her heart. So don't hurt her, don't change her, don't analyze and don't expect more than she can give. Smile when she makes you happy, let her know when she makes you mad, and miss her when she's not there." -- Bob Marley]]>
