		<description>
	    <![CDATA["After all, reading is arguably a far more creative and imaginative process than writing; when the reader creates emotion in their head, or the colors of the sky during the setting sun, or the smell of a warm summer's breeze on their face, they should reserve as much praise for themselves as they do for the writer - perhaps more." -- Jasper Fforde]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["For some people, history is simply what your wife looks good standing in front of.  It's what's cast in bronze, or framed in sepia tones, or acted out with wax dummies and period furniture.  It takes place in glass bubbles filled with water and chunks of plastic snow; it's stamped on souvenir pencils and summarized in reprint newspapers.  History nowadays is recorded in memorabilia.  If you can't purchase a shopping bag that alludes to something, people won't believe it ever happened." -- Elizabeth McCracken]]>
