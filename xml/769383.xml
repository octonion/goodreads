	    <![CDATA["The problem, if anything, was precisely the opposite. I had too much to write: 

too many fine and miserable buildings to construct and streets to name and clock towers to set chiming, 

too many characters to raise up from the dirt like flowers whose petals I peeled down to the intricate frail organs within, 

too many terrible genetic and fiduciary secrets to dig up and bury and dig up again, 

too many divorces to grant, 

heirs to disinherit, 

trysts to arrange, 

letters to misdirect into evil hands,

innocent children to slay with rheumatic fever, 

women to leave unfulfilled and hopeless, 

men to drive to adultery and theft, 

fires to ignite at the hearts of ancient houses. " -- Michael Chabon]]>
