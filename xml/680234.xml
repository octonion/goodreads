		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Look at children.  Of course they may quarrel, but generally speaking they do not harbor ill feelings as much or as long as adults do.  Most adults have the advantage of education over children, but what is the use of an education if they show a big smile while hiding negative feelings deep inside?  Children dont usually act in such a manner.  If they feel angry with someone, they express it, and then it is finished.  They can still play with that person the following day." -- His Holiness the Dahai Lama]]>

	    <![CDATA["That's the nature of being a parent, Sabine has discovered. You'll love your children far more than you ever loved your parents, and -- in the recognition that your own children cannot fathom the depth of your love -- you come to understand the tragic, unrequited love of your own parents." -- Ursula Hegi]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Through the blur, I wondered if I was alone or if other parents felt the same way I did - that everything involving our children was painful in some way.  The emotions, whether they were joy, sorrow, love or pride, were so deep and sharp that in the end they left you raw, exposed and yes, in pain.  The human heart was not designed to beat outside the human body and yet, each child represented just that - a parent's heart bared, beating forever outside its chest." -- Debra Ginsberg]]>

	    <![CDATA["The Voice

There is a voice inside of you
That whispers all day long,

I know that this is wrong.&quot;
No teacher, preacher, parent, friend
Or wise man can decide
What's right for you--just listen to
The voice that speaks inside." -- Shel Silverstein]]>
