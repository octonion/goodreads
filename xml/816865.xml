	    <![CDATA["And then she thought that you went on living one day after another, and in time you were somebody else, your previous self only like a close relative, a sister or brother, with whom you shared a past.  But a different person, a separate life.  Certainly neither she nor Inman were the people they had been the last time they were together.  And she believed maybe she liked them both better now." -- Charles Frazier]]>

	    <![CDATA["The direction of a big act will warp history, but probably all acts do the same in their degree, down to a stone stepped over in the path or the breath caught at sight of a pretty girl or a fingernail nicked in the garden soil." -- John Steinbeck]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Now, there are many millions in their sects and churches who feel the order, 'Do thou,' and throw their weight into obedience.  And there are millions more who feel predestination in 'Thou shalt.'  Nothing they may do can interfere with what will be.  But 'Thou mayest'!  Why, that makes a man great, that gives him stature with the gods, for in his weakness and his filth and his murder of his brother he has still the great choice.  He can choose his course and fight it through and win." -- John Steinbeck]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["We have only one story.  All novels, all poetry, are built on the never-ending contest in ourselves of good and evil.  And it occurs to me that evil must constantly respawn, while good, while virtue, is immortal.  Vice has always a new fresh young face, while virtue is venerable as nothing else in the world is." -- John Steinbeck]]>
