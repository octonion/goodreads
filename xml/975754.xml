	    <![CDATA["It is naively assumed that the fact that the majority of people share certain ideas and feelings proves the validity of these ideas and feelings.  Nothing could be further from the truth. Consensual validation as such has no bearing on reason or mental health." -- Erich Fromm]]>

	    <![CDATA["When I look in the fridge, I see groceries, but I don't see food. My stomach growls; but there is no appetite.

Appetite and hunger are different. Appetite is the mental prompting that kicks the auto-response into drive so you actually reach out, take the food, put it in your mouth, chew, and swallow. I learned this in my first psychology course. Eating isn't just a physical need; it starts in the mind, generating hunger, which then should trigger the body to ingest food. I have no sparks between these plugs." -- Julie Gregory]]>

	    <![CDATA["And so I went through the looking glass, stepped into the netherworld, where up is down and food is greed, where convex mirrors cover the walls, where death is honor and flesh is weak. It is ever so easy to go. Harder to find your way back." -- Marya Hornbacher]]>
