	    <![CDATA["I've hurt you terribly my love, and I'll hunt you again during the next fifty years. And you are going to hurt me, Ian-never I hope as much as you are hurting me now. But if that's the way it has to be, then I'll endure it, because the only alternative is to live without you, and that is no life at all. And the difference is that I know it, and you don't... not yet..." -- Judith McNaught]]>

	    <![CDATA["Not long ago I learned from a certain person in considerable detail about the worthlessness of your character.  All the same, it is you who have given me strength, you who have put the rainbow of revolution in my breast.  It is you who have given an object to my life." -- Osamu Dazai]]>
