	    <![CDATA["[A woman's] education should be as varied and perfect as possible.  If for no other reason to enable her properly to educate and rear her own children.  Whatever grand truths are planted in the mother's mind may take root in the next generation, and there grow, blossom, and shed their perfume on the world.  The child receives the mother's very thought by intuition.  If the mother's mind is weak and narrow in its range, the child is affected by this fact long before it finds meaning in the mother's words.  But if the mother's mind is cultured and refined by study until her thoughts are grand and far-reaching, the child's soul will grow and expand under the mesmeric influence of these thoughts, as the plant grows under the influence of the sun." -- Karen Andreola]]>
