		<description>
	    <![CDATA["She should have done science, not spent all her time with her head in novels.  Novels gave you a completely false idea about life, they told lies and they implied there were endings when in reality there were no endings, everything just went on and on and on." -- Kate Atkinson]]>

	    <![CDATA["You can’t save others from themselves because those who make a perpetual muddle of their lives don’t appreciate your interfering with the drama they’ve created. They want your poor-sweet-baby sympathy, but they don’t want to change." -- Sue Grafton]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Except for cases that clearly involve a homicidal maniac, the police like to believe murders are committed by those we know and love, and most of the time they're right - a chilling thought when you sit down to dinner with a family of five. All those potential killers passing their plates." -- Sue Grafton]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["So much of the past in encapsulated in the odds and ends.  Most of us discard more information about ourselves than we ever care to preserve.  Our recollection of the past is not simply distorted by our faulty perception of events remembered but skewed by those forgotten.  The memory is like twin orbiting stars, one visible, one dark, the trajectory of what's evident forever affected by the gravity of what's concealed." -- Sue Grafton]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I thought about the current contamination of beaches, raw sewage spilling into oceans and streams, the hole in the ozone, forests being stripped, the toxic-waste dumps, the merry plunder of mankind added to the drought and the famine that nature dishes up annually as a matter of course. It's hard to know what's actually going to get us first. Sometimes I think we should just blow the whole planet and get it over with. It's the suspense that's killing me." -- Sue Grafton]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["She thought about how it was so simple with animals.  They gave their hearts without question or fear.  They had no expectations.  They were so easy to love.  If people could only be like that, no one would ever be hurt, she thought.  No one would ever need to learn how to forgive." -- Elizabeth  George]]>
