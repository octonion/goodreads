	    <![CDATA["Knowledge isn't truth. It's just mindless agreement. You agree with me, I agree with someone else - we all have knowledge. We haven't come any closer to the truth. You can never understand anything by agreeing, by making definitions. Only by turning over the possibilities. That's called thinking. If I say &quot;I know&quot;, I stop thinking. As long as I keep thinking, I come to understand. That way, I might approach some truth." -- Terry Johnson]]>
