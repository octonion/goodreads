	    <![CDATA["For instance, on the planet Earth, man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much&amp;mdash;the wheel, New York, wars and so on&amp;mdash;whilst all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time. But conversely, the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man&amp;mdash;for precisely the same reasons." -- Douglas Adams]]>

	    <![CDATA["There are so many kinds of time. The time by which we measure our lives. Months and years. Or the &lt;i&gt;big&lt;/i&gt; time, the time that raises mountains and makes stars. Or all the things that happen between one heartbeat and the next. Its hard to live in all those kinds of times. Easy to &lt;i&gt;forget&lt;/i&gt; that you live in all of them." -- Robert Charles Wilson]]>

	    <![CDATA["When religion and politics travel in the same cart, the riders believe nothing can stand in their way.  Their movements become headlong - faster and faster and faster.  They put aside all thoughts of obstacles and forget the precipice does not show itself to the man in a blind rush until it's to late." -- Frank Herbert]]>
