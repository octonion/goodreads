	    <![CDATA["Books say: She did this because. Life says: She did this. Books are where things are explained to you; life is where things aren't. I'm not surprised some people prefer books.

But more than that, he taught me something about good nature. It is enough to be benign, to be gentle, to be funny, to be kind." -- Stephen Fry]]>

Ah, how can we bear it?&quot;

Bear what?&quot;

This. For so short a time. How can we sleep this time away?&quot;

We can be quiet together, and pretend - since it is only the beginning - that we have all the time in the world.&quot;

And every day we shall have less. And then none.&quot;

Would you rather, therefore, have had nothing at all?&quot;

No. This is where I have always been coming to. Since my time began. And when I go away from here, this will be the mid-point, to which everything ran, before, and from which everything will run. But now, my love, we are here, we are now, and those other times are running elsewhere." -- A.S. Byatt]]>
