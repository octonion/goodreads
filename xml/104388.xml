	    <![CDATA["Even 
After 
All this time
The Sun never says to the Earth,

&quot;You owe me.&quot;

Look
What happens
With a love like that,
It lights the whole sky." -- Hafiz]]>

	    <![CDATA["We die containing a richness of lovers and tribes, tastes we have swallowed, bodies we have plunged into and swum up as if rivers of wisdom, characters we have climbed into as if trees, fears we have hidden in as if caves. 

I wish for all this to be marked on by body when I am dead.  I believe in such cartography - to be marked by nature, not just to label ourselves on a map like the names of rich men and women on buildings.  We are communal histories, communal books.  We are not owned or monogamous in our taste or experience." -- Michael Ondaatje]]>

	    <![CDATA["Be courteous to all, but intimate with few, and let those few be well tried before you give them your confidence. True friendship is a plant of slow growth, and must undergo and withstand the shocks of adversity before it is entitled to appellation. " -- George Washington]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I exist as I am, that is enough, 
If no other in the world be aware I sit content, 
And if each and all be aware I sit content. 
One world is aware, and by the far the largest to me, and that is myself, 
And whether I come to my own today or in ten thousand or ten million years, 
I can cheerfully take it now, or with equal cheerfulness, I can wait." -- Walt Whitman]]>

	    <![CDATA["We must remember that we are the ones we have been waiting for.  We are the ones who must speck the truth of what we know.  And if we are not healthy, if we are not filled with the joy of our work, our voices will be silenced by our own despair.
