	    <![CDATA["A great library doesn't have to be big or beautiful.  It doesn't have to have the best facilities or the most efficient staff or the most users.  A great library provides.  It is enmeshed in the life of a community in a way that makes it indispensable.  A great library is one nobody notices because it is always there, and always has what people need." -- Vicki Myron]]>

	    <![CDATA["Once, in my father's bookshop, I heard a regular customer say that few things leave a deeper mark on a reader than the first book that finds its way into his heart.  Those first images, the echo of words we think we have left behind, accompany us throughout our lives and sculpt a palace in our memory to which, sooner or later—no matter how many books we read, how many worlds we discover, or how much we learn or forget—we will return." -- Carlos Ruiz Zafon]]>
