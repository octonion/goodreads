	    <![CDATA["I can't exactly say why I've chosen to write about the things that I am writing about.  There are doubtless better stories from my life that I am missing, events and escapades I am not wise enough to know were important.  If heaven is tolerant and writers are allowed (bunch of liars that they are), I wonder if they gather for coffee to ponder the prose they should have written instead.
