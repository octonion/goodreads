	    <![CDATA["Anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that &lt;i&gt;'my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge.'&lt;/i&gt;" -- Isaac Asimov]]>

	    <![CDATA["Beware the irrational, however seductive. Shun the 'transcendent' and all who invite you to subordinate or annihilate yourself. Distrust compassion; prefer dignity for yourself and others. Don't be afraid to be thought arrogant or selfish. Picture all experts as if they were mammals. Never be a spectator of unfairness or stupidity. Seek out argument and disputation for their own sake; the grave will supply plenty of time for silence. Suspect your own motives, and all excuses. Do not live for others any more than you would expect others to live for you." -- Christopher Hitchens]]>

	    <![CDATA["The main thing that I learned about conspiracy theory, is that conspiracy theorists believe in a conspiracy because that is more comforting. The truth of the world is that it is actually chaotic. The truth is that it is not The Iluminati, or The Jewish Banking Conspiracy, or the Gray Alien Theory. 

The truth is far more frightening -  Nobody is in control. 

The world is rudderless." -- Alan Moore]]>
