	    <![CDATA["It is so easy to be hopeful in the daytime when you can see the things you wish on.  But it was night, it stayed night.  Night was striding across nothingness with the whole round world in his hands . . . They sat in company with the others in other shanties, their eyes straining against cruel walls and their souls asking if He meant to measure their puny might against His.  They seemed to be staring at the dark, but their eyes were watching God." -- Zora Neale Hurston]]>
