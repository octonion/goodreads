But it's not.&quot;  Though he didn't smile, his eyes lightened a shade. &quot;You're far more stubborn than she ever was.&quot; 
I sniffed. &quot;That's like the pot calling the kettle black,&quot; I whispered, and a faint, tiny grin finally crossed his face, before his expression clouded and he lowered his head, touching his forehead to mine. &quot;What do you want of me, Meghan?&quot; he asked, a low thread of anguish flickering below the surface. 

Tears blurred my vision, all the fear and heartache of the past few days rising to the surface. &quot;Just you,&quot; I whispered. &quot;I just want you.&quot;

	    <![CDATA["Ash brushed my cheek with the back of his hand, catching a loose strand of hair between his fingers.  &quot;I've seen thousands of mortal girls,&quot; he said softly, &quot;more than you could ever count, from all corners of your world.  To me, they're all the same.&quot;  His finger slid below my chin, tilting my head up.  &quot;They only see this outer shell, not who I really am, beneath.  You have.  You've seen me without the glamour and illusions, even the ones I show my family, the farce I maintain just to survive.  You've seen who I really am, and yet, you're still here.&quot;  He brushed his thumb over my skin, leaving a trail of icy heat.  &quot;You're here, and the only dance I want is this one." -- Julie Kagawa]]>

	    <![CDATA["Just answer me this. Is she worth it?&quot; Ash's face went blank and cold, like a door slamming shut. 
&quot;Would this be considered payment for  finding sweetfinger?&quot; he replied in a voice dead of emotion. 
The dwarf snorted. &quot;Yeah, sure, whatever. But I want a serious answer, Prince.&quot;
Ash was still for a moment. &quot;Yes,&quot; he murmured, his voice so low I barely caught it. &quot;She's worth it.&quot;
&quot;You know Mab will tear you apart for this.&quot;
&quot;I know.&quot;

-Dwarf and Ash" -- Julie Kagawa]]>

	    <![CDATA["He hesitated, but then stepped beneath the tree and knelt, depositing me gently on the ground between two giant roots.  And he stayed there, kneeling beside me, holding my hand in his.  Something splashed the back of my hand, cold as spring water, crystalling to my skin.  A faery's tears." -- Julie Kagawa]]>
