	    <![CDATA["The king lifted a hand to her cheek and kissed her. It was not a kiss between strangers, not even a kiss between a bride and groom. It was a kiss between a man and his wife, and when it was over, the king closed his eyes and rested his forehead in the hollow of the queen's shoulder, like a man seeking respite, like a man reaching home at the end of the day." -- Megan Whalen Turner]]>

	    <![CDATA["Relius looked away. &quot;He said that you...cried,&quot; he said softly.
&quot;But not that he cried as well,&quot; said the queen, amused at the memory. &quot;We were very lachrymose... would you like to hear more romance of the evening? He told me the Guard should be reduced by half, and I threw an ink jar at his head.&quot;
&quot;Is that when he cried?&quot;
&quot;He ducked,&quot; said Attolia dryly.
&quot;I had not pictured you for a fishwife.&quot;
&quot;Lo, the transforming power of love." -- Megan Whalen Turner]]>

Eddis stared. “Your capacity to land yourself in a mess because you didn't think first, Eugenides, will never cease to amaze me. What do you mean you didn't think about being king? Is Attolia going to marry you and move into my library?" -- Megan Whalen Turner]]>
