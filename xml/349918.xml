	    <![CDATA["Hey, girls, you're beautiful. Don't look at those stupid magazines with sticklike models. Eat healthy and exercise. That's all. Don't let anyone tell you you're not good enough. You're good enough, you are too good. Love your family with all your heart and listen to it. You are gorgeous, whether you're a size 4 or 14. It doesn't matter what you look like on the outside, as long as you're a good person, as long as you respect others. I know it's been told hundreds of times before, but it's true. Hey, girls, you are beautiful." -- Gerard Way]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Before I opened my computer in the parking lot today, I relived one of my favorite memories. It's the one with Woody and me sitting on the steps of the Metropolitan Museum after it's closed. We're watching people parade out of the museum in summer shorts and sandals. The trees to the south are planted in parallel lines. The water in the fountain shoots up with a mist that almost reaches the steps we sit on. We look at silver-haired ladies in red-and-white-print dresses. We separate the mice from the men, the tourists from the New Yorkers, the Upper East Siders from the West Siders. The hot-pretzel vendor sells us a wad of dough in knots with clumps of salt stuck on top. We make our usual remarks about the crazies and wonder what it would be like to live in a penthouse apartment on Fifth Avenue overlooking the Met. We laugh and say the same things we always say. We hold hands and keep sitting, just sitting, as the sun beings to set. It's a perfect afternoon." -- Diane Keaton]]>

	    <![CDATA["Fatâ€™ is usually the first insult a girl throws at another girl when she wants to hurt her.

I mean, is â€˜fatâ€™ really the worst thing a human being can be? Is â€˜fatâ€™ worse than â€˜vindictiveâ€™, â€˜jealousâ€™, â€˜shallowâ€™, â€˜vainâ€™, â€˜boringâ€™ or â€˜cruelâ€™? Not to me; but then, you might retort, what do I know about the pressure to be skinny? Iâ€™m not in the business of being judged on my looks, what with being a writer and earning my living by using my brainâ€¦

I went to the British Book Awards that evening. After the award ceremony I bumped into a woman I hadnâ€™t seen for nearly three years. The first thing she said to me? â€˜Youâ€™ve lost a lot of weight since the last time I saw you!â€™

â€˜Well,â€™ I said, slightly nonplussed, â€˜the last time you saw me Iâ€™d just had a baby.â€™

What I felt like saying was, â€˜Iâ€™ve produced my third child and my sixth novel since I last saw you. Arenâ€™t either of those things more important, more interesting, than my size?â€™ But no â€“ my waist looked smaller! Forget the kid and the book: finally, something to celebrate!

Iâ€™ve got two daughters who will have to make their way in this skinny-obsessed world, and it worries me, because I donâ€™t want them to be empty-headed, self-obsessed, emaciated clones; Iâ€™d rather they were independent, interesting, idealistic, kind, opinionated, original, funny â€“ a thousand things, before â€˜thinâ€™. And frankly, Iâ€™d rather they didnâ€™t give a gust of stinking chihuahua flatulence whether the woman standing next to them has fleshier knees than they do. Let my girls be Hermiones, rather than Pansy Parkinsons." -- J.K. Rowling]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["She remembered one of her boyfriends asking, offhandedly, how many books she read in a year. &quot;A few hundred,&quot; she said.
&quot;How do you have the time?&quot; he asked, gobsmacked.
She narrowed her eyes and considered the array of potential answers in front of her. Because I don't spend hours flipping through cable complaining there's nothing on? Because my entire Sunday is not eaten up with pre-game, in-game, and post-game talking heads? Because I do not spend every night drinking overpriced beer and engaging in dick-swinging contests with the other financirati? Because when I am waiting in line, at the gym, on the train, eating lunch, I am not complaining about the wait/staring into space/admiring myself in reflective surfaces? I am reading!
&quot;I don't know,&quot; she said, shrugging." -- Eleanor Brown]]>
