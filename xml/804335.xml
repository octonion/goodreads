	    <![CDATA["Despite what we knitters know to be true, the non-knitting world somehow persists in thinking that a &quot;knitter&quot; looks a certain way. Most likely, this picture is one of an elderly woman, grandmotherly and polite, sitting in her rocking chair surrounded by homemade cookies and accompanied by a certain number of cats.

In reality, a knitter today is just as likely to be young, hip, male, and sitting at a &quot;Stitch and Bitch&quot; in a local bar. Several of today's best knitting designers are men, and a knitter is as likely to have body piercings as homemade cookies. 

&lt;i&gt;Despite our diversity, the tendency to be accompanied by a cat is an oddity among knitters that cannot be explained.&lt;/i&gt;" -- Stephanie Pearl-McPhee]]>

When choosing a pattern, look for ones that have words such as &quot;simple&quot;, &quot;basic&quot;, and &quot;easy&quot;. If you see the words &quot;intriguing&quot;, &quot;challenging&quot;, or &quot;intricate&quot;, look elsewhere. 

If you happen across a pattern that says &quot;heirloom&quot;, slowly put down the pattern and back away.

&lt;i&gt;&quot;Heirloom&quot; is knitting code for &quot;This pattern is so difficult that you would consider death a relief&quot;." -- Stephanie Pearl-McPhee]]>

	    <![CDATA["As long as there has been knitting there have been battles about it. There are self-declared &quot;yarn snobs,&quot; who frown on using anything but natural fibers; &quot;gauge snobs&quot;, who wouldn't be caught dead with chunky yarn; and &quot;experience snobs&quot;, who claim you can't declare yourself a real knitter until you abandon novelty yarns. The truth is that the knitting world is a tiny metaphor for the real world. It takes all kinds.

&lt;i&gt;I will not allow myself to feel bad if someone disapproves of my knitting. I will also resist the urge to stuff his mailbox full of chunky acrylic fun fur at 3:00 am.&lt;/i&gt;" -- Stephanie Pearl-McPhee]]>

	    <![CDATA["Dear designer of questionable intent,

Please send me a photo of yourself. Please be wearing the knitted pants that you designed. It's not that I don't believe that there is anyone out there thing enough to wear horizontally stripped trousers knit from chunky wool, it's just that I would like to know whether you are deliberately cruel or whether you are the one woman these would look really great on." -- Stephanie Pearl-McPhee]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["My mother taught me to knit when I was seven.  I forgot about knitting until one day I saw Marion at the counter with hers and confessed that I knew how.  Confessed is the right word.  In those days, in the early 1980s, knitting was not a hobby a preteen would readily admit to.  But Marion, every enthusiastic, pounced upon me and insisted that I show her something I'd made.  I did -- a misshapen scarf -- which she priased exravagantly.  she lent me a raspberry-colored wool for another project, a hat for myself.  Since then I've been knitting pretty continuously.  It's addictive and it's soothing, and fora a few minutes anyway, it makes me feel closer to my mother." -- Anita Shreve]]>
