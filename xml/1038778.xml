		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["She had some hidden reason of her own for attaching great importance to this choosing what her mother was to wear.  What was the reason, Mrs. Ramsay wondered, standing still to let her clasp the necklace she had chosen, divining, through her own past, some deep, some buried, some quite speechless feeling that one had for one's mother at Rose's age.  Like all feelings felt for oneself, Mrs. Ramsay thought, it made one sad.  It was so inadequate, what one could give in return; and what Rose felt was quite out of proportion to anything she actually was.  And Rose would grow up; and Rose would suffer, she supposed, with these deep feelings, and she said she was ready now..." -- Virginia Woolf]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["...so now, Mrs. Ramsay thought, she could return to that dream land, that unreal but fascinating place, the Manning's drawing-room at Marlow twenty years ago; where one moved about without haste or anxiety, for there was no future to worry about.  She knew what had happened to them, what to her.  It was like reading a good book again, for she knew the end of that story, since it had happened twenty years ago, and life, which shot down even from this dining-room table in cascades, heaven knows where, was sealed up there, and lay, like a lake, placidly between its banks." -- Virginia Woolf]]>

	    <![CDATA["With her foot on the threshold she waited a moment longer in a scene which was vanishing even as she looked, and then, as she moved and took Minta's arm and left the room, it changed, it shaped itself differently; it had become, she knew, giving one last look at it over her shoulder, already the past." -- Virginia Woolf]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Why then did she do it?  She looked at the canvas, lightly scored with running lines.  It would be hung in the servants' bedrooms.  It would be rolled up and stuffed under a sofa.  What was the good of doing it then, and she heard some voice saying she couldn't paint, saying she couldn't create, as if she were caught up in one of those habitual currents in which after a certain time experience forms in the mind, so that one repeats words without being aware any longer who originally spoke them." -- Virginia Woolf]]>

So she said nothing, but looked doggedly and sadly at the shore, wrapped in its mantle of peace; as if the people there had fallen alseep, she thought; were free like smoke, were free to come and go like ghosts.  They have no suffering there, she thought." -- Virginia Woolf]]>

	    <![CDATA["My life was hurrying, racing tragically toward its end.  And yet at the same time it was dripping so slowly, so very slowly now, hour by hour, minute by minute.

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["There was once a man who lost his shadow.  I forget what happened to him, but it was dreadful.  As for me, I've lost my own image.  I did not look at it often; but it was there, in the background, just as Maurice had drawn it for me.  A straightforward, genuine, &quot;authentic&quot; woman, with out mean-mindedness, uncompromising, but at the same time understanding, indulgent, sensitive, deeply feeling, intensely aware of things and of people, passionately devoted to those she loved and creating happiness for them.  A fine life, serene, full, &quot;harmonious.&quot;  It is dark: I cannot see myself anymore.  And what do the others see?  Maybe something hideous." -- Simone de Beauvoir]]>
