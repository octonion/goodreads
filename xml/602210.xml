	    <![CDATA["And this I believe: that the free, exploring mind of the individual human is the most valuable thing in the world. And this I would fight for: the freedom of the mind to take any direction it wishes, undirected. And this I must fight against: any idea, religion, or government which limits or destroys the individual. This is what I am and what I am about." -- John Steinbeck]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["For him that stealeth,or borroweth and returneth not,this book from its owner, let it change into a serpent in his hand and rend him. 
Let him be struck with palsy, and all his members blasted. 
Let him languish in pain, crying aloud for mercy, and let there be no surcease to this agony till he sing in dissolution. 
Let bookworms gnaw his entrails in token of the worm that dieth not, and when at last he goeth to his last punishment, let the flames of hell consume him for ever.

&lt;i&gt;Curse on book thieves&lt;/i&gt;, from the monastery of San Pedro, Barcelona, Spain" -- Cornelia Funke]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["And on the subject of burning books: I want to congratulate librarians, not famous for their physical strength or their powerful political connections or their great wealth, who, all over this country, have staunchly resisted anti-democratic bullies who have tried to remove certain books from their shelves, and have refused to reveal to thought police the names of persons who have checked out those titles.

So the America I loved still exists, if not in the White House or the Supreme Court or the Senate or the House of Representatives or the media. The America I love still exists at the front desks of our public libraries." -- Kurt Vonnegut]]>
