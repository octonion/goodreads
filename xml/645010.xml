	    <![CDATA["How much better is silence; the coffee cup, the table. How much better to sit by myself like the solitary sea-bird that opens its wings on the stake. Let me sit here for ever with bare things, this coffee cup, this knife, this fork, things in themselves, myself being myself." -- Virginia Woolf]]>

	    <![CDATA["I should have written you a letter, it was too late to make the deaths of my brothers an excuse.  Since they died, I wrote a book; why not a letter?  A mysterious but truthful answer is that while I can gear myself up to do a novel, letters, real-life communications, are too much for me.  I used to rattle them off easily enough; why is the challenge of writing to friends and acquaintances too much for me now?  Because I have become such a solitary, and not in the Aristotelian sense: not a beast, not a god.  Rather, a loner troubled by longings, incapable of finding a suitable language and despairing at the impossibility of composing messages in a playable key--as if I no longer understood the codes used by the estimable people who wanted to hear from me and would have so much to reply if only the impediments were taken away." -- Saul Bellow]]>
