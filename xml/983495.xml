		<description>
	    <![CDATA["No one can give a definition of the soul.  But we know what it feels like.  The soul is the sense of something higher than ourselves, something that stirs in us thoughts, hopes, and aspirations which go out to the world of goodness, truth and beauty.  The soul is a burning desire to breathe in this world of light and never to lose it--to remain children of light." -- Albert Schweitzer]]>
