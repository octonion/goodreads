		<description>
	    <![CDATA["On one level, Americans are too distant from the Middle East, too naive to understand its complexities and history.  On another, it's the people who show up in Washington-Iranian and Arab exiles nursing a grudge, with time on their hands and money to pay for a hotel-who influence U.S. policy by default.  They color Washington's view of the world, drawing us into foreign adventures we have no business being in." -- Robert Baer]]>

	    <![CDATA["Oh, what can you do with a man like that?  What can you do?  How can you dissuade his eye in a crowd from seeking out the cheek with acne, the infirm hand; how can you teach him to respond to the inestimable greatness of the race, the harsh surface beauty of life; how can you put his finger for him on the obdurate truths before which fear and horror are powerless?  The sea that morning was iridescent and dark.  My wife and my sister were swimming--Diana and Helen--and I saw their uncovered heads, black and gold in the dark water.  I saw them come out and I saw that they were naked, unshy, beautiful, and full of grace, and I watched the naked women walk out of the sea." -- John Cheever]]>
