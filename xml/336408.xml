	    <![CDATA["I think that if we are going to reform the world, and make it a better place to live in, the way to do it is not with talk about relationships of a political nature...or with programs full of things for other people to do...The place to improve the world is first in one's own heart and head and hands, and then work outword from there. Other people can talk about how to expand the destiny of mankind. I just want to talk about how to fix a motorcycle. " -- Robert Pirsig]]>

	    <![CDATA["Perhaps, when we remember wars, we should take off our clothes and paint ourselves blue and go on all fours all day long and grunt like pigs. That would surely be more appropriate than noble oratory and shows of flags and well-oiled guns." -- Kurt Vonnegut]]>

	    <![CDATA["I felt after I finished Slaughterhouse-Five that I didn’t have to write at all anymore if I didn’t want to. It was the end of some sort of career. I don’t know why, exactly. I suppose that flowers, when they’re through blooming, have some sort of awareness of some purpose having been served. Flowers didn’t ask to be flowers and I didn’t ask to be me. At the end of Slaughterhouse-Five…I had a shutting-off feeling…that I had done what I was supposed to do and everything was OK ." -- Kurt Vonnegut]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Then take me disappearin' through the smoke rings of my mind, 
Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves, 
The haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach, 
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow. 

Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free, 
Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands, 
With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves, 
Let me forget about today until tomorrow." -- Bob Dylan]]>
