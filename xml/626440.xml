I'm tired of looking out for everyone else and having to put aside what &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; want. Dimitri and I did that, and look what happened. He's gone. I will never hold him again.

	    <![CDATA["The spell. Victor said you had to want me... to care about me... for it to work.&quot; When he didn't say anything, I tried to grip his shirt, but my fingers were too weak. &quot;Did you? Did you want me?&quot;
His words came out thickly. &quot;Yes, Roza. I did want you. I still do. I wish... we could be together.&quot;
&quot;Then why did you lie to me?&quot;
We reached the clinic, and he managed to open the door while still holding me. As soon as he stepped inside, he began yelling for help. 
&quot;Why did you lie?&quot; I murmured again.
Still holding me in his arms, he looked down at me. I could hear voices and footsteps getting closer.
&quot;Because we can't be together.&quot;
&quot;Because of the age thing, right?&quot; I asked. &quot;Because you're my mentor?&quot;
His fingertip gently wiped away a tear that had escaped down my cheek. &quot;That's part of it,&quot; he said. &quot;But also... well, you and I will both be Lissa's gaurdians someday. I need to protect her at all cost. If a pack of Strogoi come, I need to throw my body between them and her.&quot;
I know that. Of course that's what you have to do.&quot; The black sparkles were dancing in front of my eyes again. I was fading out.
&quot;No. If I let myself love you, I won't throw myself in front of her. I'll throw myself in front of you." -- Richelle Mead]]>

I said 'Lord, if I've never had courage in my life before, let me have it now. Let me be brave enough not to fall on my knees and beg her to stay.' He pulled his eyes away from the cottage and smiled briefly at me. 
Hardest thing I ever did, Sassenach." -- Diana Gabaldon]]>
