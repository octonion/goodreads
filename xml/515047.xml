		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I see the mycelium as the Earth's natural Internet, a consciousness with which we might be able to communicate.  Through cross-species interfacing, we may one day exchange information with these sentient cellular networks.  Because these externalized neurological nets sense any impression upon them, from footsteps to falling tree branches, they could relay enormous amounts of data regarding the movements of all organisms through the landscape." -- Paul Stamets]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I believe that mycelium is the neurological network of nature.  Interlacing mosaics of mycelium infuse habitats with information-sharing membranes.  These membranes are aware, react to change, and collectively have the long-term health of the host environment in mind.  The mycelium stays in constant molecular communication with its environment, devising diverse enzymatic and chemical responses to complex challenges." -- Paul Stamets]]>

	    <![CDATA["Nothing in the world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. The slogan Press On! has solved and always will solve the problems of the human race." -- Calvin Coolidge]]>
