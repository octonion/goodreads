	    <![CDATA["Wait,&quot; I say.  &quot;I think you're mistaken.  Saying there is no dream is the same as saying everything is a dream.  Isn't it?  Everyone's a dreamer?  Extraordinary things happen all the time even when we're awake.  What I meant to suggest to you, if indeed that was me in your dream doing the suggesting, is that there is only one world.  This one.  The dream is real.  The ordinary is the wonderful.  The wonderful is the ordinary." -- Samantha Hunt]]>
