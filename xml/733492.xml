	    <![CDATA["All right,&quot; said Susan. &quot;I'm not stupid. You're saying humans need... &lt;i&gt;fantasies&lt;/i&gt; to make life bearable.&quot;

REALLY? AS IF IT WAS SOME KIND OF PINK PILL? NO. HUMANS NEED FANTASY TO BE HUMAN. TO BE THE PLACE WHERE THE FALLING ANGEL MEETS THE RISING APE.

&quot;Tooth fairies? Hogfathers? Little—&quot;

YES. AS PRACTICE. YOU HAVE TO START OUT LEARNING TO BELIEVE THE &lt;i&gt;LITTLE&lt;/i&gt; LIES.

&quot;So we can believe the big ones?&quot;

YES. JUSTICE. MERCY. DUTY. THAT SORT OF THING.

&quot;They're not the same at all!&quot;

YOU THINK SO? THEN TAKE THE UNIVERSE AND GRIND IT DOWN TO THE FINEST POWDER AND SIEVE IT THROUGH THE FINEST SIEVE AND THEN &lt;i&gt;SHOW&lt;/i&gt; ME ONE ATOM OF JUSTICE, ONE MOLECULE OF MERCY. AND YET—Death waved a hand. AND YET YOU ACT AS IF THERE IS SOME IDEAL ORDER IN THE WORLD, AS IF THERE IS SOME...SOME &lt;i&gt;RIGHTNESS&lt;/i&gt; IN THE UNIVERSE BY WHICH IT MAY BE JUDGED.

&quot;Yes, but people have &lt;i&gt;got&lt;/i&gt; to believe that, or what's the &lt;i&gt;point&lt;/i&gt;—&quot;

MY POINT EXACTLY." -- Terry Pratchett]]>

	    <![CDATA["A European says: I can't understand this, what's wrong with me? An American says: I can't understand this, what's wrong with him?
I make no suggestion that one side or other is right, but observation over many years leads me to believe it is true." -- Terry Pratchett]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The universe contains any amount of horrible ways to be woken up, such as the noise of the mob breaking down the front door, the scream of fire engines, or the realization that today is the Monday which on Friday night was a comfortably long way off. 

A dog's wet nose is not strictly speaking the worst of the bunch, but it has it's own peculiar dreadfulness which connoisseurs of the ghastly and dog owners everywhere have come to know and dread. It's like having a small piece of defrosting liver pressed lovingly against you." -- Terry Pratchett]]>
