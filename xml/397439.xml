	    <![CDATA["God bless us everyone
We're a broken people,
living under loaded gun
And it can't be outfought
it can't be outdone
It can't be outmatched
it can't be outrun,
No
God bless us everyone
We're a broken people,
living under loaded gun
And it can't be outfought
it can't be outdone
It can't be outmatched
it can't be outrun,
No

And when I close my eyes tonight
to symphonies of blinding light
God bless us everyone
We're a broken people,
living under loaded gun
Oh

Like memories in cold decay
transmissions echoing away
Far from the world of you and I
where oceans bleed into the sky

God save us everyone
Will we burn inside the fires
of a thousand suns
For the sins of our hands
the sins of our tongues
The sins of our fathers
the sins of our young
No

God save us everyone
Will we burn inside the fires
of a thousand suns
For the sins of our hands
the sins of our tongues
The sins of our fathers
the sins of our young
No

And when I close my eyes tonight
to symphonies of blinding light
God save us everyone
Will we burn inside the fires 
of a thousand suns
Ooh

Like memories in cold decay
transmissions echoing away
Far from the world of you and I
where oceans bleed into the sky

Ooh
Like memories in cold decay
transmissions echoing away
Far from the world of you and I
where oceans bleed into the sky

Lift me up,
Let me go

Lift me up,
Let me go

Lift me up,
Let me go

Lift me up,
Let me go

Lift me up,
Let me go

Lift me up,
Let me go

Lift me up,
Let me go

Lift me up,
Let me go

Lift me up,
Let me go

Lift me up,
Let me go

Lift me up,
Let me go
And it can't be outfought
it can't be outdone
It can't be outmatched
it can't be outrun, no

God bless us everyone
We're a broken people
living under loaded gun
Lift me up,
Let me go

And it can't be outfought
it can't be outdone
It can't be outmatched
it can't be outrun, no
Lift me up,
Let me go

God bless us everyone
We're a broken people
living under loaded gun
Lift me up,
Let me go

And it can't be outfought
it can't be outdone
It can't be outmatched
it can't be outrun
Lift me up," -- Linkin Park]]>
