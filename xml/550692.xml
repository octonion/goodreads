		<description>
	    <![CDATA["When God has specially promised the thing, we are bound to believe we shall recieve it when we pray for it. You have no right to put in an 'if', and say, 'Lord, if it be thy will...&quot; This is to insult God. To put an 'if' in God's promise when God has put none there, is tantamount to charging God with being insincere." -- Charles G. Finney]]>

	    <![CDATA["We fell in love, despite our differences, and once we did, something rare and beautiful was created.

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Love is the ultimate outlaw. It just won't adhere to any rules. The most any of us can do is to sign on as its accomplice. Instead of vowing to honor and obey, maybe we should swear to aid and abet. That would mean that security is out of the question. The words &quot;make&quot; and &quot;stay&quot; become inappropriate. My love for you has no strings attached. I love you for free." -- Tom Robbins]]>

&quot;Good morning, Pooh Bear,&quot; said Eeyore gloomily. &quot;If it is a good morning, which I doubt,&quot; said he.
&quot;Why, what's the matter?&quot;
&quot;Nothing, Pooh Bear, nothing. We can't all, and some of us don't. That's all there is to it.&quot;
&quot;Can't all what?&quot; said Pooh, rubbing his nose.
&quot;Gaiety. Song-and-dance. Here we go round the mulberry bush." -- A. A. Milne]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Men and women are needed whose prayers will give to the world the utmost power of God; who will make His promises to blossom with rich and full results. God is waiting to hear us and challenges us to bring Him to do this thing by our praying. He is asking us, to-day, as He did His ancient Israel, to prove Him now herewith.&quot; Behind God's Word is God Himself, and we read: &quot;Thus saith the Lord, the Holy One of Israel, his Maker: Ask of me of things to come and concerning my sons, and concerning the work of my hands, command ye me.&quot; As though God places Himself in the hands and at the disposal of His people who pray - as indeed He does. The dominant element of all praying is faith, that is conspicuous, cardinal and emphatic. Without such faith it is impossible to please God, and equally impossible to pray." -- E.M. Bounds]]>
