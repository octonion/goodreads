	    <![CDATA["..what came before has dissolved from me, lost like milk teeth.  But I think, rather, that it has always been as it is, and there was never a beforethis nor will there be an afternow.  I am accepting.  This is not a thing to be solved, or conquered, or destroyed.  It is.  I am.  We are.  We conjugate together in darkness, plotting against each other, the Labyrinth to eat me and I to eat it, each to swallow the hard, black opium of the other.  We hold orange petals beneath our tongues and seethe.  It has always been so.  It grinds against me and I bite into its skin.." -- Catherynne M. Valente]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["We treat desire as a problem to be solved, address what desire is for and focus on that something and how to acquire it rather than on the nature and the sensation of desire, though often it is the desire between us and the object of desire that fills the space in between with the blue of longing." -- Rebecca Solnit]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The only way you can write the truth is to assume that what you set down will never be read. Not by any other person, and not even by yourself at some later date. Otherwise you begin excusing yourself. You must see the writing as emerging like a long scroll of ink from the index finger of your right hand; you must see your left hand erasing it." -- Margaret Atwood]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The problem is that we cannot recognize that what we say about out thoughts and actions is, at best, incoherent; we can and do recognize this after the fact. But once having admitted to ourselves our own subterfuges we are confronted by newer forms, which again we only recognize after the fact. We can never at the moment itself be honest with ourselves, never really understand when we are acting out what we are truly all about. It is only in retrospect that we can explain ourselves, and this retrospective view is hardly reassuring because it does so little to alter our behavior in the future" -- Israel Rosenfield]]>
