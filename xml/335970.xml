		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The man that I named the Giver passed along to the boy knowledge, history, memories, color, pain, laughter, love, and truth.  Every time you place a book in the hands of a child, you do the same thing.  It is very risky.  But each time a child opens a book, he pushes open the gate that separates him from Elsewhere.  It gives him choices.  It gives him freedom.  Those are magnificent, wonderfully unsafe things.

[from her Newberry Award acceptance speech]" -- Lois Lowry]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Saying 'I notice you're a nerd' is like saying, 'Hey, I notice that you'd rather be intelligent than be stupid, that you'd rather be thoughtful than be vapid, that you believe that there are things that matter more than the arrest record of Lindsay Lohan. Why is that?' In fact, it seems to me that most contemporary insults are pretty lame. Even 'lame' is kind of lame. Saying 'You're lame' is like saying 'You walk with a limp.' Yeah, whatever, so does 50 Cent, and he's done all right for himself." -- John Green]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["When adults say, &quot;Teenagers think they are invincible&quot; with that sly, stupid smile on their faces, they don't know how right they are. We need never be hopeless, because we can never be irreparably broken. We think that we are invincible because we are. We cannot be born, and we cannot die. Like all energy, we can only change shapes and sizes and manifestations. They forget that when they get old. They get scared of losing and failing. But that part of us greater than the sum of our parts cannot begin and cannot end, and so it cannot fail." -- John Green]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["What is an &quot;instant&quot; death anyway? How long is an instant? Is it one second? Ten? The pain of those seconds must have been awful as her heart burst and her lungs collapsed and there was no air and no blood to her brain and only raw panic. What the hell is instant? Nothing is instant. Instant rice takes five minutes, instant pudding an hour. I doubt that an instant of blinding pain feels particularly instantaneous." -- John Green]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Eventually, he found the bed too comfortable for his state of mind, so he lay down on his back, his legs sprawled across the carpet. He anagrammed &quot;yrs forever&quot; until he found one he liked: sorry fever. And then he lay there in his fever of sorry and repeated the now memorized note in his head and wanted do cry, but instead he only felt this aching behind his solar plexus. Crying adds something: crying is you, plus tears. But the feeling Colin had was some horrible opposite of crying. It was you, minus something. He kept thinking about one word - forever - and felt the burning ache just beneath his rib cage.
It hurt like the worst ass-kicking he'd ever gotten. And he'd gotten plenty." -- John Green]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Are wild strawberries really wild? Will they scratch an adult, will they snap at a child? Should you pet them, or let them run free where they roam? Could they ever relax in a steam-heated home? Can they be trained to not growl at the guests? Will a litterbox work or would they make a mess? Can we make them a Cowberry, herding the cows, or maybe a Muleberry pulling the plows, or maybe a Huntberry chasing the grouse, or maybe a Watchberry guarding the house, and though they may curl up at your feet oh so sweetly can you ever feel that you trust them completely? Or should we make a pet out of something less scary, like the Domestic Prune or the Imported Cherry, Anyhow, you've been warned and I will not be blamed if your Wild Strawberries cannot be tamed." -- Shel Silverstein]]>

	    <![CDATA["Ol' man Simon, planted a diamond. Grew hisself a garden the likes of none. Sprouts all growin' comin' up glowin' Fruit of jewels all shinin' in the sun. Colors of the rainbow. See the sun and the rain grow sapphires and rubies on ivory vines, Grapes of jade, just ripenin' in the shade, just ready for the squeezin' into green jade wine. Pure gold corn there, Blowin' in the warm air. Ol' crow nibblin' on the amnythyst seeds. In between the diamonds, Ol' man Simon crawls about pullin' out platinum weeds. Pink pearl berries, all you can carry, put 'em in a bushel and haul 'em into town. Up in the tree there's opal nuts and gold pears- Hurry quick, grab a stick and shake some down. Take a silver tater, emerald tomater, fresh plump coral melons. Hangin' in reach. Ol' man Simon, diggin' in his diamonds, stops and rests and dreams about one... real... peach." -- Shel Silverstein]]>

	    <![CDATA["I cannot go to school today&quot;
Said little Peggy Ann McKay.
&quot;I have the measles and the mumps,
A gash, a rash and purple bumps.

My mouth is wet, my throat is dry.
I'm going blind in my right eye.
My tonsils are as big as rocks,
I've counted sixteen chicken pox.

And there's one more - that's seventeen,
And don't you think my face looks green?
My leg is cut, my eyes are blue,
It might be the instamatic flu.

I cough and sneeze and gasp and choke,
I'm sure that my left leg is broke.
My hip hurts when I move my chin,
My belly button's caving in.

My back is wrenched, my ankle's sprained,
My 'pendix pains each time it rains.
My toes are cold, my toes are numb,

I have a sliver in my thumb.

My neck is stiff, my voice is weak,
I hardly whisper when I speak.
My tongue is filling up my mouth,

I think my hair is falling out.

My elbow's bent, my spine ain't straight,
My temperature is one-o-eight.
My brain is shrunk, I cannot hear,

There's a hole inside my ear.

I have a hangnail, and my heart is ...
What? What's that? What's that you say?
You say today is .............. Saturday?

G'bye, I'm going out to play!" -- Shel Silverstein]]>

	    <![CDATA["True story
This morning I jumped on my horse
And went for a ride,
And some wild outlaws chased me
And shot me in the side.
So I crawled into a wildcats cave
To find a place to hide
But some pirates found me sleeping there
And soon they had me tied
To a pole and built a fire
Under me---I almost cried
Till a mermaid came and cut me loose
And begged to be my bride
So I said id come back Wednesday
But I must admit I lied.
Then I ran into a jungle swamp
But I forgot my guide 
And I stepped into some quicksand
And no matter how hard I tried
I couldnâ€™t get out, until I met
A watersnake named Clyde
Who pulled me to some cannibals
Who planned to have me fried
But an eagle came and swooped me up
And through the air we flied
But he dropped me in a boiling lake
A thousand miles wide
And youâ€™ll never guess what I did then---
I DIED" -- Shel Silverstein]]>

	    <![CDATA["THE BAGPIPE WHO DIDN'T SAY NO  
It was nine o'clock at midnight at a quarter after three 
When a turtle met a bagpipe on the shoreside by the sea, 
And the turtle said, &quot;My dearie, 
May I sit with you? I'm weary.&quot; 
And the bagpipe didn't say no. 
Said the turtle to the bagpipe, &quot;I have walked this lonely shore, 
I have talked to waves and pebbles--but I've never loved before. 
Will you marry me today, dear? 
Is it 'No' you're going to say dear?&quot;
But the bagpipe didn't say no. 

Said the turtle to his darling, &quot;Please excuse me if I stare, 
But you have the plaidest skin, dear, 
And you have the strangest hair.
If I begged you pretty please, love, 
Could I give you just one squeeze, love?&quot; 
And the bagpipe didn't say no. 

Said the turtle to the bagpipe, &quot;Ah, you love me. Then confess! 
Let me whisper in your dainty ear and hold you to my chest.&quot; 
And he cuddled her and teased her 
And so lovingly he squeezed her. 
And the bagpipe said, &quot;Aaooga.&quot; 

Said the turtle to the bagpipe, &quot;Did you honk or bray or neigh? 
For 'Aaooga' when your kissed is such a heartless thing to say. 
Is it that I have offended? 
Is it that our love is ended?&quot; 
And the bagpipe didn't say no. 

Said the turtle to the bagpipe, &quot;Shall i leave you, darling wife? 
Shall i waddle off to Woedom? Shall i crawl out of your life? 
Shall I move, depart and go, dear-- 
Oh, I beg you tell me 'No' dear!&quot; 
But the bagpipe didn't say no. 

So the turtle crept off crying and he ne'er came back no more, 
And he left the bagpipe lying on that smooth and sandy shore. 
And some night when tide is low there, 
Just walk up and say, &quot;Hello, there,&quot; 
And politely ask the bagpipe if this story's really so. 
I assure you, darling children, the bagpipe won't say &quot;No." -- Shel Silverstein]]>
