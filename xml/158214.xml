	    <![CDATA["The alphabet is male and female. If you will know the correct order of letters, you make a world, you make creation. This is why they will hide the order. If you will know the combinations, you make all life and death." -- Don DeLillo]]>

	    <![CDATA["The painted aircraft took on sunlight and pulse. Sweeps of color, bands and spatters, airy washes, the force of saturated light—the whole thing oddly personal, a sense of one painter’s hand moved by impulse and afterthought as much as by epic design. I hadn’t expected to register such pleasure and sensation. The air was color-scrubbed, coppers and ochers burning off the metal skin of the aircraft to exchange with the framing desert." -- Don DeLillo]]>

	    <![CDATA["I hate Erma,&quot; I told Mom...
&quot;You have to show compassion for her...&quot;  She added that you should never hate anyone, even your worst enemies.  &quot;Everyone has something good about them,&quot; she said.  &quot;You have to find the redeeming quality and love the person for that.&quot;
&quot;Oh yeah?&quot; I said.  &quot;How about Hitler?  What was his redeeming quality?&quot;
&quot;Hitler loved dogs,&quot; Mom said without hesitation." -- Jeannette Walls]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["This spot was so close to perfect we would not even want to tell ourselves how lucky we were, having been delivered to it. The best of new places had to be protected from our own cries of delight. We would hold the words for weeks or months, for the soft evening when a stray remark would set us to recollecting. I guess we believed, together, that the wrong voice can obliterate a landscape." -- Don DeLillo]]>
