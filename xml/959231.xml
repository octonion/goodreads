	    <![CDATA["A tale is told of twin boys born to different mothers.
One is dark by nature, the other light.  One is rich, the other poor.  One is harsh, the other gentle.  One is forever youthful, the other old before his time.
One is mortal.
They share no bond of blood or sympathy, but they are twins nonetheless.
They each live without ever knowing that they are brothers.
They each die fighting the blind god." -- Matthew Woodring Stover]]>

	    <![CDATA["Some humans would do anything to see if it was possible to do it. If you put a large switch in some cave somewhere, with a sign on it saying 'End-of-the-World Switch. PLEASE DO NOT TOUCH', the paint wouldn't even have time to dry." -- Terry Pratchett]]>
