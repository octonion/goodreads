		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The Road Not Taken

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both	
And be one traveler, long I stood	
And looked down one as far as I could	
To where it bent in the undergrowth;	        
 
Then took the other, as just as fair,	
And having perhaps the better claim,	
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;	
Though as for that the passing there	
Had worn them really about the same,	        
 
And both that morning equally lay	
In leaves no step had trodden black.	
Oh, I kept the first for another day!	
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,	
I doubted if I should ever come back.	        
 
I shall be telling this with a sigh	
Somewhere ages and ages hence:	
Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”	
I took the one less traveled by,	
And that has made all the difference." -- Robert Frost]]>

	    <![CDATA["The mind is sharper and keener in seclusion and uninterrupted solitude. No big laboratory is needed in which to think. Originality thrives in seclusion free of outside influences beating upon us to cripple the creative mind. Be alone, that is the secret of invention; be alone, that is when ideas are born. That is why many of the earthly miracles have had their genesis in humble surroundings.&quot;

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I believe that the universe was formed around 15 billion years ago and that humans have evolved from their apelike ancestors over the past few million years.  I believe we are more likely to live a good life if all humans try to work together in a world community, preserving planet earth.  When decisions for groups are made in this world, I believe that the democratic process should be used.  To protect the individual, I believe in freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of religion, freedom from religion, freedom of inquiry, and a wall of separation between church and state.  When making decisions about what is right or wrong, I believe I should use my intelligence to reason about the likely consequences of my actions.  I believe that I should try to increase the happiness of everyone by caring for other people and finding ways to cooperate.  Never should my actions discriminate against people simply because of their race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, age, or national origin.  I believe that ideas about what is right and wrong will change with education, so I am prepared to continually question ideas using evidence from experience and science.  I believe there is no valid evidence to support claims for the existence of supernatural entities and deities.  I will use these beliefs to guide my thinking and my actions until I find good reasons for revising them or replacing them with other beliefs that are more valid." -- Ronald P. Carver]]>

So the America I loved still exists, if not in the White House or the Supreme Court or the Senate or the House of Representatives or the media. The America I love still exists at the front desks of our public libraries." -- Kurt Vonnegut]]>

	    <![CDATA["I haven't any right to criticize books, and I don't do it except when I hate them. I often want to criticize Jane Austen, but her books madden me so that I can't conceal my frenzy from the reader; and therefore I have to stop every time I begin. Every time I read Pride and Prejudice I want to dig her up and beat her over the skull with her own shin-bone." -- Mark Twain]]>
