	    <![CDATA["Have you ever watched the jet cars race on the boulevard?...I sometimes think drivers don’t know what grass is, or flowers, because they never see them slowly...If you showed a driver a green blur, Oh yes! He'd say, that’s grass! A pink blur! That’s a rose garden! White blurs are houses. Brown blurs are cows." -- Ray Bradbury]]>

Even being lied to constantly, though hardly like love, was sustained attention; he must care about her to fabricate so elaborately and over such a long stretch of time. His deceit was a form of tribute to the importance of their marriage." -- Ian McEwan]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I never really even tried.  But if I'm not a New York actress, what am I?  I'm a person who takes a subway from the outer boroughs to lower Manhattan office every morning, who spends her days answering phones and doing copying, who is too disconsolate when she gets back to her apartment at night to do anything but sit on the couch and stare vacantly at reality TV shows until she falls asleep.  Oh Godm it really was true, wasn't it? I really was a secretary." -- Julie Powell]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["... I began to ponder; this life we had for ourselves, Eric and I, it felt like the opposite of Potage Parmentier.  It was easy enough to keep on with the soul-sucking jobs; at least it saved having to make a choice.  But how much longer could I take such an easy life?  Quicksand was easy.  Hell, death was easy.  Maybe that's why my synapses had started snapping at the sight of potatoes and leeks in the Korean deli.  Maybe that was what was plucking deep down in my belly whenever I thought of Julia Child's book.  Maybe I needed to make like a potato, winnow myself down, be a part of something that was not easy, just simple." -- Julie Powell]]>
