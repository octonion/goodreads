	    <![CDATA["I am no king, and I am no lord,
And I am no soldier at-arms,&quot; said he.
&quot;I'm none but a harper, and a very poor harper,
That am come hither to wed with ye.&quot;

&quot;If you were a lord, you should be my lord,
And the same if you were a thief,&quot; said she.
&quot;And if you are a harper, you shall be my harper,
For it makes no matter to me, to me,
For it makes no matter to me.&quot;

&quot;But what if it prove that I am no harper?
That I lied for your love most monstrously?&quot;

&quot;Why, then I'll teach you to play and sing,
For I dearly love a good harp,&quot; said she." -- Peter S. Beagle]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The true secret in being a hero lies in knowing the order of things. The swineherd cannot already be wed to the princess when he embarks on his adventures, nor can the boy knock on the witch's door when she is already away on vacation. The wicked uncle cannot be found out and foiled before he does something wicked. Things must happen when it is time for them to happen. Quests may not simply be abandoned; prophecies may not be left to rot like unpicked fruit; unicorns may go unrescued for a very long time, but not forever. The happy ending cannot come in the middle of the story." -- Peter S. Beagle]]>

He was a maniac and a monster, but people don't love like that anymore. Or maybe it's only the maniacs and monsters who do. I don't know. " -- Peter S. Beagle]]>

	    <![CDATA["I am a king's daughter,
And if I cared to care,
The moon that has no mistress
Would flutter in my hair.
No one dares to cherish
What I choose to crave.
Never have I hungered,
For that I did not have
I am a kings daughter,
And I grow old within
The prison of my person,
The shackles of my skin.
And I would run away
And beg from door to door,
Just to see your shadow
Once, and never more. " -- Peter S. Beagle]]>

	    <![CDATA["Where have you been?&quot; she cried. &quot;Damn you, where have you been?&quot; She took a few steps toward Schmendrick, but she was looking beyond him, at the unicorn.

When she tried to get by, the magician stood in her way. &quot;You don't talk like that,&quot; he told her, still uncertain that Molly had recognized the unicorn. &quot;Don't you know how to behave, woman? You don't curtsy, either.&quot;

But Molly pushed him aside and went up to the unicorn, scolding her as though she were a strayed milk cow. &quot;&lt;i&gt;Where have you been?&lt;/i&gt;&quot; Before the whiteness and the shining horn, Molly shrank to a shrilling beetle, but this time it was the unicorn's old dark eyes that looked down.

&quot;I am here now,&quot; she said at last.

Molly laughed with her lips flat. &quot;And what good is it to me that you're here now? Where where you twenty years ago, ten years ago? How dare you, how dare you come to me now, when I am &lt;i&gt;this?&lt;/i&gt;&quot; With a flap of her hand she summed herself up: barren face, desert eyes, and yellowing heart. &quot;I wish you had never come. Why did you come now?&quot; The tears began to slide down the sides of her nose.

The unicorn made no reply, and Schmendrick said, &quot;She is the last. She is the last unicorn in the world.&quot;

&quot;She would be.&quot; Molly sniffed. &quot;It would be the last unicorn in the world to come to Molly Grue.&quot; She reached up then to lay her hand on the unicorn's cheek; but both of them flinched a little, and the touch came to rest on on the swift, shivering place under the jaw. Molly said, &quot;It's all right. I forgive you." -- Peter S. Beagle]]>
