		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The struggle is inner: Chicano, indio, American Indian, mojado, mexicano, immigrant Latino, Anglo in power, working class Anglo, Black,  Asian--our psyches resemble the bordertowns and are populated by the  same people. The struggle has always been inner, and is played out in outer terrains. Awareness of our situation must come before inner changes, which in turn come before changes in society. Nothing happens in the &quot;real&quot; world unless it first happens in the images in our heads." -- Gloria Anzaldua]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Until the philosophy which holds one race superior and another inferior is finally and permanently discredited and abandoned, everywhere is war and until there are no longer first-class and second-class citizens of any nation, until the color of a man's skin is of no more significance than the color of his eyes. And until the basic human rights are equally guaranteed to all without regard to race, there is war. And until that day, the dream of lasting peace, world citizenship, rule of international morality, will remain but a fleeting illusion to be pursued, but never attained... now everywhere is war.”
Popularized by Bob Marley in the song War" -- Haile Selassie I]]>
