	    <![CDATA["Ned?' he says, after a while. 'Oi, Ned?'
'What?'
'If someone says to you that the guy they're going out with doesn't have to prove how smart he is, what's your response?'
'That he's dumb.'
'And if he has a sixpack?'
'Dumb jock.'
'Not too intense.'
'Dumb jock with no personality.'
'And they see eye to eye?'
Ned pauses. 'With the spitfire from Dili?'
'&lt;i&gt;Same&lt;/i&gt;,' Tom corrects.
Ned holds up a hand to where Tara would reach him in height.
'Dumb jock with no personality and short-man syndrome.'
'Thanks, Ned.'
'Anytime." -- Melina Marchetta]]>

	    <![CDATA["...women are elephants and watch the way you say that in front of them because they'll think you're calling them fat and there's no coming back from that moment.  But they hoard.  They say they don't, but they do.  We think that if something's not spoken about again, it goes away.  It doesn't.  Nothing goes away just like that..." -- Melina Marchetta]]>
