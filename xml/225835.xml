		<description>
	    <![CDATA["It has always seemed strange to me...The things we admire in men, kindness and generosity, openness, honesty, understanding and feeling, are the concomitants of failure in our system. And those traits we detest, sharpness, greed, acquisitiveness, meanness, egotism and self-interest, are the traits of success. And while men admire the quality of the first they love the produce of the second." -- John Steinbeck]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Look at them. There are your true philosophers. I think that Mack and the boys know everything that has ever happened in the world and possibly everything that will happen. I think they survive in this particular  world better than other people. In a time when people tear themselves to pieces with ambition and nervousness and covetousness, they are relaxed. All of our so-called successful men are sick men, with bad stomachs, and bad souls, but Mack and the boys are healthy and curiously clean. They can do what they want. They can satisfy their appetites without calling them something else." -- John Steinbeck]]>

He could talk to children, telling them very profound things so that they understood.  He lived in a world of wonders, of excitement.  He was concupiscent as a rabbit and gentle as hell.  Everyone who knew him was indebted to him.  And everyone who thought of him thought next, 'I really must do something nice for Doc." -- John Steinbeck]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["To live (as I understand it) is to exist within a conception of time.
But to remember is to vacate the very notion of time.
Every memory, no matter how remote its subject, takes place 'Now,' at the moment it's called to the mind.
The more something is recalled, the more the brain has a chance to refine the original experience.
Because every memory is a re-creation, not a playback." -- David Mazzucchelli]]>
