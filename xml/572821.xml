	    <![CDATA["I was the shadow of the waxwing slain
By the false azure in the windowpane;
I was the smudge of ashen fluff -and I
Lived on, flew on, in the reflected sky.
And from the inside, too, I'd duplicate
Myself, my lamp, an apple on a plate:
Uncurtaining the night, I'd let dark glass
Hang all the furniture above the grass,
And how delightful when a fall of snow
Covered my glimpse of lawn and reached up so
As to make chair and bed exactly stand
Upon that snow, out in that crystal land!" -- Vladimir Nabokov]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["it’s true this world our breathing laboured
inspires nothing more than obvious disgust
a desire to flee without our share
and no longer read the headlines

we long to return to our ancestral home
where our forebears once lived under an angel’s wing
we long to find that strange morality
which sanctified life to the end

we crave something like loyalty
like the embrace of mild addictions
something that transcends yet contains life
we cannot live far from eternity" -- Michel Houellebecq]]>
