		<description>
	    <![CDATA["It's taken years for me to understand that dying doesn't end the story; it transforms it. Edits, rewrites, the blur, aand epiphany of one-way dialogue.  Most of us wander in and out of one another's lives until not death, but distance, does us part-- time and space and heart's weariness are the blander executioners or human connection." -- Gail Caldwell]]>

	    <![CDATA["in all the years i had blundered along in search of my own footing, she had never given me an inkling of this wish.  unburdened by the demands of history or anyone else's dreams, i had wandered toward and finally reached a world far outside the plains i loved and loathed.  my mother had neither begrudged me this journey nor expected it, certain that i had to make my own way.  but she packed my toolbox with her great wit and forbearance before i went, and she stashed there, for long safekeeping, her desire." -- Gail Caldwell]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The only education in grief that any of us ever gets is a crash course. Until Caroline had died I had belonged to that other world, the place of innocence, and linear expectations, where I thught grief was a simple, wrenching realm of sadness and longing that graduallu receded. What that definition left out was the body blow that loss inflicts, as well as the temporary madness, and a range of less straightforward emotions shocking in their intensity." -- Gail Caldwell]]>
