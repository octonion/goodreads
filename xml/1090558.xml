		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Selfishly, perhaps, Catti-brie had determined that the assassin was her own business.  He had unnerved her, had stripped away years of training and discipline and reduced her to the quivering semblance of a frightened child.  But she was a young woman now, no more a girl.  She had to personally respond to that emotional humiliation, or the scars from it would haunt her to her grave, forever paralyzing her along her path to discover her true potential in life." -- R.A. Salvatore]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Nostalgia is a necessary thing, I believe, and a way for all of us to find peace in that which we have accomplished, or even failed to accomplish.  At the same time, if nostalgia precipitates actions to return to that fabled, rosy-painted time, particularly in one who believes his life to be a failure, then it is an empty thing, doomed to produce nothing but frustration and an even greater sense of failure." -- R.A. Salvatore]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["There is one other error in the Gondsman's line of resoning, I believe, on ap urely emotional level.  If machines replace achievement, then to what will people aspire?  And who are we, truly, without such goals?
   Beware the engineers of society, I say, who would make everyone in all the world equal.  Opportunity should be equal, must be equal, but achievement must remain individual." -- R.A. Salvatore]]>
