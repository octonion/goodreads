	    <![CDATA["Happiness is the consequence of personal effort.  You fight for it, strive for it, insist upon it, and sometimes even travel around the world looking for it.  You have to participate relentlessly in the manifestations of your own blessings.  And once you have achieved a state of happiness, you must never become lax about maintaining it.  You must make a mighty effort to keep swimming upward into that happiness forever, to stay afloat on top of it." -- Elizabeth Gilbert]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["If you take a book with you on a journey,&quot; Mo had said when he put the first one in her box, &quot;an odd thing happens: The book begins collecting your memories. And forever after you have only to open that book to be back where you first read it. It will all come into your mind with the very first words: the sights you saw in that place, what it smelled like, the ice cream you ate while you were reading it... yes, books are like flypaper—memories cling to the printed page better than anything else." -- Cornelia Funke]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Books can be possessive, can't they? You're walking around in a bookstore and a certain one will jump out at you, like it had moved there on its own, just to get your attention. Sometimes what's inside will change your life, but sometimes you don't even have to read it. Sometimes it's a comfort just to have a book around.  Many of these books haven't even had their spines cracked.  'Why do you buy books you don't even read?' our daughter asks us.  That's like asking someone who lives alone why they bought a cat.  For company, of course." -- Sarah Addison Allen]]>

	    <![CDATA["Fate never promises to tell you everything up front.  You aren't always shown the path in life you're supposed to take.  But if there was one thing she'd learned in the past few weeks, it was that sometimes, when you're really lucky, you meet someone with a map." -- Sarah Addison Allen]]>
