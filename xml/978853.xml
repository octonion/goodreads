		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The best men tell you the truth because they think you can take it; the worst men either try to preserve you in some innocent state with their false protection, or are ‘brutally honest.’ When someone tells, lets you think for yourself, experience your own emotions, he is treating you as a true equal, a friend…And the best men cook for you." -- Whitney Otto]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["No one fights dirtier or more brutally than blood; only family knows it’s own weaknesses, the exact placement of the heart. The tragedy is that one can still live with the force of hatred, feel infuriated that once you are born to another, that kinship lasts through life and death, immutable, unchanging, no matter how great the misdeed or betrayal. Blood cannot be denied, and perhaps that’s why we fight tooth and claw, because we cannot—being only human—put asunder what God has joined together." -- Whitney Otto]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Once you love, you cannot take it back, cannot undo it; what you felt may have changed, shifted slightly, yet still remains love.  You still feel-though very small-the not-altogether unpleasant shock of soul recognition for that person." -- Whitney Otto]]>

	    <![CDATA["The truly terrible thing about this life, was not knowing what you want, but only able to recognize what you do not want. You have to spend so much time and energy trying to find it out, time that other people spent in pursuing of their desires." -- Whitney Otto]]>
