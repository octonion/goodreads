	    <![CDATA["I realized I was going to get through this disappointing service, and anyway, you have to be somewhere: better here, where I have heard truth spoken so often, than, say, at the DMV, or home alone, orbiting my own mind. And it's good to be out where others can see you, so you can't be your ghastly spoiled self. It forces you to act slightly more elegantly, and this improves your thoughts, and thereby the world." -- Anne Lamott]]>

This education had reduced us to a nation of morons; we were strangers to our own culture and camp followers of another culture, feeding on leavings &amp; garbage..." -- R K Narayan]]>
