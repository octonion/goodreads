	    <![CDATA["When we get out of the glass bottles of our ego,
and when we escape like squirrels turning in the
cages of our personality
and get into the forests again,
we shall shiver with cold and fright
but things will happen to us
so that we don't know ourselves.

Cool, unlying life will rush in,
and passion will make our bodies taut with power,
we shall stamp our feet with new power
and old things will fall down,
we shall laugh, and institutions will curl up like
burnt paper." -- D.H. Lawrence]]>

	    <![CDATA["The last scud of day holds back for me, It flings my likeness after the rest and true as any on the shadow'd wilds,
 It coaxes me to the vapor and the dusk.

I depart as air, I shake my white locks at the runaway sun, I effuse my flesh in eddies, and drift it in lacy jags.

I bequeath myself to the dirt to grow from the grass I love, If you want me again look for me under your boot-soles.

You will hardly know who I am or what I mean, 
But I shall be good health to your nevertheless,
And filter and fibre your blood.

Failing to fetch me at first keep encouraged,
Missing me one place, search another,
I stop somewhere waiting for you." -- Walt Whitman]]>

	    <![CDATA["Now you feel how nothing clings to you; 
your vast shell reaches into endless space, and there the rich, thick fluids rise and flow.  
Illuminated in your infinite peace, 
a billion stars go spinning through the night, blazinghigh above your head.  
But IN you is the presence that will be, when all the stars are dead." -- Rainer Maria Rilke]]>
