Rather, we should be post-racist: moving beyond cultural fascism and vicious narratives of racial privilege and superiority that tear at the fabric of &quot;e pluribus unum." -- Michael Eric Dyson]]>

	    <![CDATA["I go about things in an oblique way. It's like a sidelong glance. This doesn't mean I don't like the sharp stab of directness—only that what I like more are all the moments, leading up to that moment of directness or that expression of rage . . . how long rage was silenced before it exploded and at what cost." -- Lê Thi Diem Thúy]]>

She was not a melancholy agnostic, but the optimistic kind. She liked to give God the benefit of the doubt." -- Allegra Goodman]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["We are meaning-seeking creatures. Dogs, as far as we know, do not agonise about the canine condition, worry about the plight of dogs in other parts of the world, or try to see their lives from a different perspective. But human beings fall easily into despair, and from the very beginning we invented stories that enabled us to place our lives in a larger setting, that revealed an underlying pattern, and gave us a sense that, against all the depressing and chaotic evidence to the contrary, life had meaning and value" -- Karen Armstrong]]>

And deprived of his myth he felt extraordinarily lonely." -- Patrick O'Brian]]>
