		<description>
	    <![CDATA["There is no such thing as pure good or pure evil, least of all in people.  In the best of us there are thoughts or deeds that are wicked, and in the worst of us, at least some virtue.  An adversary is not one who does loathsome acts for their own sake.  He always has a reason that to him is justification.  My cat eats mice.  Does that make him bad?  I don't think so, and the cat doesn't think so, but I would bet the mice have a different opinion." -- Terry Goodkind]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["People are stupid; given proper motivation, almost anyone will believe almost anything. Because people are stupid, they will believe a lie because they want to believe it's true, or because they are afraid it might be true. Peopleâ€™s heads are full of knowledge, facts, and beliefs, and most of it is false, yet they think it all true. People are stupid; they can only rarely tell the difference between a lie and the truth, and yet they are confident they can, and so are all the easier to fool." -- Terry Goodkind]]>
