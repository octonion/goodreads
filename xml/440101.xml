	    <![CDATA["The fault-finder will find faults even in paradise. Love your life, poor as it is. You may perhaps have some pleasant, thrilling, glorious hours, even in a poor-house.

I do not see but a quiet mind may live as contentedly there, and have as cheering thoughts, as in a palace." -- Henry David Thoreau]]>
