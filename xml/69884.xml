	    <![CDATA["All the books we own, both read and unread, are the fullest expression of self we have at our disposal. ... But with each passing year, and with each whimsical purchase, our libraries become more and more able to articulate who we are, whether we read the books or not." -- Nick Hornby]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["A man who wants to die feels angry and full of life and desperate and bored and exhausted, all at the same time; he wants to fight everyone, and he wants to curl up in a ball and hide in a cupboard somewhere.  He wants to say sorry to everyone, and he wants everyone to know just how badly they've all let him down." -- Nick Hornby]]>
