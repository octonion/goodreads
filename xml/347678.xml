	    <![CDATA["The nonbelievers need the believers. They are desperate to have someone believe.&quot; &quot;As belief shrinks from the world, people find it more necessary than ever that someone believe...Those who have abandoned belief must still believe in us. They are sure that they are right not to believe but they know belief must not fade completely. Hell is when no one believes." -- Don DeLillo]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["When I read obituaries I always note the age of the deceased.  Automatically I relate this figure to my own age.  Four years to go, I think.  Nine more years.  Two years and I'm dead.  The power of numbers is never more evident than when we use them to speculate on the time of our dying." -- Don DeLillo]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Be like water making its way through cracks. Do not be assertive, but adjust to the object, and you shall find a way around or through it. If nothing within you stays rigid, outward things will disclose themselves. 

Empty your mind, be formless. Shapeless, like water. If you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle and it becomes the bottle. You put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Now, water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend." -- Bruce Lee]]>
