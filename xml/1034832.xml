		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I put no stock in religion. By the word religion I have seen the lunacy of fanatics of every denomination be called the will of God. I've seen too much religion in the eyes of too many murderers. Holiness is in right action, and courage on behalf of those who cannot defend themselves, and goodness. What God desires is here [the head] and here [the heart] and what you decide to do every day will make you a good man...or not." -- Hospitaller]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["You asked me who created the universe. Let me ask you this: who created God?” Desh frowned. “God is eternal. He didn’t need a creator.” “Really?” said Kira. “Then why does the universe need one? If God can exist without a creator, why can’t the universe? No matter how you slice it, at some point you get to something that existed without being created. Which is impossible for even" -- Douglas E. Richards]]>
