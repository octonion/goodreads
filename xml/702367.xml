	    <![CDATA["As Qhuinn looked at his best friend's handsome face, he felt as if he'd never not known that red hair, those blue eyes, those lips, that jaw. And it was because of their long history that he searched for something to say, something that would get them back to where they had been.  All that came to him was . . . I miss you. I miss you so fucking bad it hurts, but I don't know how to find you even though you're right in front of me." -- J.R. Ward]]>

	    <![CDATA["His hand was on my throat, and he was crushing me back with his body into the cold steel beam behind me. &quot;Yes, I have loved, Ms. Lane, and although it‘s none of your business, I have lost. Many things. And no, I am not like any other player in this game and I will never be like V‘lane, and I get a hard-on a great deal more often than occasionally.&quot; He leaned fully against me and I gasped. 

&quot;Sometimes it‘s over a spoiled little girl, not a woman at all. And yes, I trashed the bookstore when I couldn‘t find you. You‘ll have to choose a new bedroom, too. And I‘m sorry your pretty little world got all screwed up, but everybody‘s does, and you go on. It‘s how you go on that defines you.&quot; His hand relaxed on my throat. &quot;And I am going to tattoo you, Ms. Lane, however and wherever I please." -- Karen Marie Moning]]>
