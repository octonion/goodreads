	    <![CDATA["Adventure comes with no guarantees or promises.  Risk and reward are conjoined twins—and that’s why my favorite piece of advice needs translation but no disclaimers:  Fortes fortuna juvat.  ‘Fortune favors the brave,’ the ancient Roman dramatist Terrence declared.  In other words, there are many good reasons not to toss your life up in the air and see how it lands.  Just don’t let fear be one of them." -- Mary South]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["It must be borne in mind that the tragedy of life doesn’t lie in not reaching your goal.  The tragedy lies in having no goal to reach.  It isn’t a calamity to die with dreams unfulfilled, but it is a calamity not to dream.  It is not a disaster to be unable to capture your ideal, but it is a disaster to have no ideal to capture.  It is not a disgrace not to reach the stars, but it is a disgrace to have no stars to reach for.  Not failure, but low aim is sin." -- Benjamin E Mays]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist. We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes. We should take nothing for granted. Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals, so that security and liberty may prosper together." -- Dwight D. Eisenhower]]>
