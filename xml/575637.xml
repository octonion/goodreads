		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Great works of art in all cultures succeed in capturing within the constraints of their form both the pathos of anguish and a vision of its resolution. Take, for example, the languorous sentences of Proust or the haiku of Basho, the late quartets and sonatas of Beethoven, the tragicomic brushwork of Sengai or the daunting canvases of Rothko, the luminous self-portraits of Rembrandt and Hakuin. Such works achieve their resolution not through consoling or romantic images whereby anguish is transcended. They accept anguish without being overwhelmed by it. They reveal anguish as that which gives beauty its dignity and depth." -- Stephen Batchelor]]>

	    <![CDATA["The Voice

There is a voice inside of you
That whispers all day long,
&quot;I feel this is right for me,
I know that this is wrong.&quot;
No teacher, preacher, parent, friend
Or wise man can decide
What's right for you--just listen to
The voice that speaks inside." -- Shel Silverstein]]>

	    <![CDATA["They went to university because someone, at a time when universities seemed important, said that in order to rise in the world, you had to have a degree. And thus the world was deprived of some excellent gardeners, bakers, antique dealers, sculptors, and writers." -- Paulo Coelho]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I want a life that sizzles and pops and makes me laugh out loud. And I don't want to get to the end, or to tomorrow, even, and realize that my life is a collection of meetings and pop cans and errands and receipts and dirty dishes. I want to eat cold tangerines and sing out loud in the car with the windows open and wear pink shoes and stay up all night laughing and paint my walls the exact color of the sky right now. I want to sleep hard on clean white sheets and throw parties and eat ripe tomatoes and read books so good they make me jump up and down, and I want my everyday to make God belly laugh, glad that he gave life to someone who loves the gift." -- Shauna Niequist]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["May today there be peace within.   

May you trust God that you are exactly where you are meant to be.  
 
May you not forget the infinite possibilities that are born of faith.  
 
May you use those gifts that you have received, and pass on the love that has been given to you.   

May you be content knowing you are a child of God. 

 Let this presence settle into your bones, and allow your soul the freedom to sing, dance, praise and love.   

It is there for each and every one of us." -- Teresa of Ávila]]>
