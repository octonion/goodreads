	    <![CDATA["I'll be looking for you, Will, every moment, every single moment. And when we do find each other again, we'll cling together so tight that nothing and no one'll ever tear us apart. Every atom of me and every atom of you... We'll live in birds and flowers and dragonflies and pine trees and in clouds and in those little specks of light you see floating in sunbeams... And when they use our atoms to make new lives, they wont' just be able to take one, they'll have to take two, one of you and one of me, we'll be joined so tight..." -- Philip Pullman]]>

	    <![CDATA["It was time to take the pumpkin out of the pot and eat it. In the final analysis, that was what solved these big problems of life. You could think and think and get nowhere, but you still had to eat your pumpkin. That brought you down to earth. That gave you a reason for going on. Pumpkin." -- Alexander McCall Smith]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["My life is very monotonous,&quot; the fox said. &quot;I hunt chickens: men hunt me. All the chickens are just alike, and all the men are just alike. And, in consequence, I am a little bored. But if you tame me, it will be as if the sun came to shine on my life. I shall know the sound of a step that will be different from all the others. Other steps send me hurrying back underneath the ground. Yours will call me, like music, out of my burrow. And then look: you see the grain fields down yonder? [...] The wheat fields have nothing to say to me. And that is sad. But you have hair that is the color of gold. Think how wonderful that will be when you have tamed me! The grain, which is also golden, will bring me back to the thought of you. And I shall love to listen to the wheat in the wind..." -- Antoine St]]>

	    <![CDATA["So the little prince tamed the fox. And when the hour of his departure drew near--

Ah,&quot; said the fox, &quot;I shall cry.&quot;

It is your own fault,&quot; said the little prince. &quot;I never wished you any sort of harm; but you wanted me to tame you . . .&quot;

Yes, that is so,&quot; said the fox.

But now you are going to cry!&quot; said the little prince.

Yes, that is so,&quot; said the fox.

Then it has done you no good at all!&quot;

It has done me good,&quot; said the fox, &quot;because of the color of the wheat fields." -- Antoine de Saint-Exupéry]]>
