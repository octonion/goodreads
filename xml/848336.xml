	    <![CDATA["We put thirty spokes together and call it a wheel,
But it is on the space where there is nothing that the usefulness of the wheels depends.

We turn clay to make vessel,
But it is on the space where there is nothing that the usefulness of the vessel depends.

We pierce doors and windows to make a house,
And it is on these spaces where there is nothing that the usefulness of the house depends.

Therefore just as we take advantage of what is, we should recognize the usefulness of what is not." -- Lao-Tse]]>

	    <![CDATA["Don't make up problems you don't have yet. It's not a problem until it's a real problem. Most of the things you worry about never happen anyway.

The decisions you make today don't need to last forever. If circumstances change, your decisions CAN change. Decisions are temporary.

Pay attention to today and worry about later when it gets here. Otherwise, you'll waste energy, time and money fixating on problems that may never materialize.&quot;

~ An excerpt from the awesome book, &quot;Rework" -- Jason Fried David Heinemeier Hansson]]>
