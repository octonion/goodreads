	    <![CDATA["My silences had not protected me. Your silence will not protect you.

	    <![CDATA["As I swept the last bit of dust, I made a covenant with myself: I will accept. Whatever will be, will be. I have a life to lead. I recalled words a friend had told me, the philosophy of her faith. &quot;Life is a journey and a struggle,&quot; she had said. &quot;We cannot control it, but we can make the best of any situation.&quot; I was indeed in quite a situation. It was up to me to make the best of it." -- Wangari Maathai]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["It is a very strange sensation to inexperienced youth to feel itself quite alone in the world, cut adrift from every connection, uncertain whether the port to which it is bound can be reached, and prevented by many impediments to returning to that it has quitted. The charm of adventure sweetens that sensation, the glow of pride warms it; but then the throb of fear disturbs it..." -- Charlotte Bronte]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["A great deal; you are good to those who are good to you.  It is all I ever desire to be.  If people were always kind and obedient to those who are cruel and unjust, the wicked people would have it all their own way; they would never feel afraid, and so they would never alter, but would grow worse and worse.  When we are struck at without a reason, we should strike back again very hard; I am sure we should - so hard as to teach the person who struck us never to do it again." -- Charlotte Brontë]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["What is the meaning of life? That was all- a simple question; one that tended to close in on one with years, the great revelation had never come. The great revelation perhaps never did come. Instead, there were little daily miracles, illuminations, matches struck unexpectedly in the dark; here was one." -- Virginia Woolf]]>

	    <![CDATA["Jo's breath gave out here, and wrapping her head in the paper, she bedewed her little story with a few natural tears, for to be independent and earn the praise of those she loved were the dearest wishes of her heart, and this seemed to be the first step toward that happy end." -- Louisa May Alcott]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Heart, my heart, so battered with misfortune far beyond your strength, up, and face the men who hate us. Bare your chest to the assault of the enemy, and fight them off. Stand fast among the beamlike spears. Give no ground; and if you beat them, do not brag in open show, nor, if they beat you, run home and lie down on your bed and cry. Keep some measure in the joy you take in luck, and the degree you give away to sorrow. All your life is up-and-down like this." -- Archilochus]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The generations of men are like the leaves of a tree. 
Few mortals who've heard this take it to heart: 
all men carry the hope rooted in their youth. 
While mortals are still living in youth's lovely flowering, 
light-headed, their hearts cling to many vain things: 
they won't grow old, they'll never die,
 and being healthy, why give sickness a moment's thought? 
Fools to think that way, they don't yet know 
how quickly time moves for mortals, how short the young days. 
But since you know this now that your end is near, 
treat yourself entirely to what good things there are." -- Semonides of Amorgos]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Mice, if you've come here looking for bread,
head off for somebody's corner elsewhere
(my hut provides the most meager living).
There you'll surely find cheese to nibble and figs to pluck
and meal after meal made of leftovers.
But if you sharpen your teeth again on my books,
you'll quickly come to know, wailing.
a banquet not good for you at all." -- Ariston]]>
