	    <![CDATA["Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do." -- Apple Computer Inc.]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, 'Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous?' Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It's not just in some of us; it's in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others." -- Marianne Williamson]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I've learned that no matter what happens, or how bad it seems today, life does go on, and it will be better tomorrow. I've learned that you can tell a lot about a person by the way he/she handles these three things: a rainy day, lost luggage, and tangled Christmas tree lights. I've learned that regardless of your relationship with your parents, you'll miss them when they're gone from your life. I've learned that making a &quot;living&quot; is not the same thing as making a &quot;life.&quot; I've learned that life sometimes gives you a second chance. I've learned that you shouldn't go through life with a catcher's mitt on both hands; you need to be able to throw something back. I've learned that whenever I decide something with an open heart, I usually make the right decision. I've learned that even when I have pains, I don't have to be one. I've learned that every day you should reach out and touch someone. People love a warm hug, or just a friendly pat on the back. I've learned that I still have a lot to learn. I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel." -- Maya Angelou]]>

&quot;I am,&quot; he said. He was staring at me, and I could see the corners of his eyes crinkling. &quot;I'm in love with you, and I'm not in the business of denying myself the simple pleasure of saying true things. I'm in love with you, and I know that love is just a shout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that we're all doomed and that there will come a day when all our labor has been returned to dust, and I know the sun will swallow the only earth we'll ever have, and I am in love with you." -- John Green]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["When adults say, &quot;Teenagers think they are invincible&quot; with that sly, stupid smile on their faces, they don't know how right they are. We need never be hopeless, because we can never be irreparably broken. We think that we are invincible because we are. We cannot be born, and we cannot die. Like all energy, we can only change shapes and sizes and manifestations. They forget that when they get old. They get scared of losing and failing. But that part of us greater than the sum of our parts cannot begin and cannot end, and so it cannot fail." -- John Green]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["He’s not perfect. You aren’t either, and the two of you will never be perfect. But if he can make you laugh at least once, causes you to think twice, and if he admits to being human and making mistakes, hold onto him and give him the most you can. He isn’t going to quote poetry, he’s not thinking about you every moment, but he will give you a part of him that he knows you could break. Don’t hurt him, don’t change him, and don’t expect for more than he can give. Don’t analyze. Smile when he makes you happy, yell when he makes you mad, and miss him when he’s not there. Love hard when there is love to be had. Because perfect guys don’t exist, but there’s always one guy that is perfect for you." -- Bob Marley]]>

	    <![CDATA["I'm coming back into focus when Caesar asks him if he has a girlfriend back home. Peeta hesitates, then gives an unconvincing shake of his head.

Handsome lad like you. There must be some special girl. Come on, what’s her name?&quot; says Caesar.

Peeta sighs. &quot;Well, there is this one girl. I’ve had a crush on her ever since I can remember. But I’m pretty sure she didn’t know I was alive until the reaping.&quot;

Sounds of sympathy from the crowd. Unrequited love they can relate to.

She have another fellow?&quot; asks Caesar.

I don’t know, but a lot of boys like her,&quot; says Peeta.

So, here’s what you do. You win, you go home. She can’t turn you down then, eh?&quot; says Caesar encouragingly.

I don’t think it’s going to work out. Winning...won’t help in my case,&quot; says Peeta.

Why ever not?&quot; says Caesar, mystified.

Peeta blushes beet red and stammers out. &quot;Because...because...she came here with me." -- Suzanne Collins]]>

&quot; Live, then, and be happy, beloved children of my heart, and never forget, that until the day God will deign to reveal the future to man, all human wisdom is contained in these two words, 'Wait and Hope." -- Alexandre Dumas]]>

	    <![CDATA["I DON'T CARE!&quot; Harry yelled at them, snatching up a lunascope and throwing it into the fireplace. &quot;I'VE HAD ENOUGH, I'VE SEEN ENOUGH, I WANT OUT, I WANT IT TO END, I DON'T CARE ANYMORE!&quot;
&quot;You do care,&quot; said Dumbledore. He had not flinched or made a single move to stop Harry demolishing his office. His expression was calm, almost detached. &quot;You care so much you feel as though you will bleed to death with the pain of it." -- J.K. Rowling]]>

	    <![CDATA["Once on a yellow piece of paper with green lines
	he wrote a poem
And he called it &quot;Chops&quot;
	because that was the name of his dog

And that's what it was all about
And his teacher gave him an A
	and a gold star
And his mother hung it on the kitchen door
	and read it to his aunts
That was the year Father Tracy
	took all the kids to the zoo

And he let them sing on the bus
And his little sister was born
	with tiny toenails and no hair
And his mother and father kissed a lot
And the girl around the corner sent him a
Valentine signed with a row of X's

	and he had to ask his father what the X's meant
And his father always tucked him in bed at night
And was always there to do it

Once on a piece of white paper with blue lines
	he wrote a poem
And he called it &quot;Autumn&quot;

	because that was the name of the season
And that's what it was all about
And his teacher gave him an A
	and asked him to write more clearly
And his mother never hung it on the kitchen door
	because of its new paint

And the kids told him
	that Father Tracy smoked cigars
And left butts on the pews
And sometimes they would burn holes
That was the year his sister got glasses
	with thick lenses and black frames
And the girl around the corner laughed

	when he asked her to go see Santa Claus
And the kids told him why
	his mother and father kissed a lot
And his father never tucked him in bed at night
And his father got mad
	when he cried for him to do it.


Once on a paper torn from his notebook
	he wrote a poem
And he called it &quot;Innocence: A Question&quot;
	because that was the question about his girl
And that's what it was all about
And his professor gave him an A

	and a strange steady look
And his mother never hung it on the kitchen door
	because he never showed her
That was the year that Father Tracy died
And he forgot how the end
	of the Apostle's Creed went

And he caught his sister
	making out on the back porch
And his mother and father never kissed
	or even talked
And the girl around the corner
	wore too much makeup
That made him cough when he kissed her

	but he kissed her anyway
	because that was the thing to do
And at three a.m. he tucked himself into bed
	his father snoring soundly

That's why on the back of a brown paper bag
	he tried another poem

And he called it &quot;Absolutely Nothing&quot;
Because that's what it was really all about
And he gave himself an A
	and a slash on each damned wrist
And he hung it on the bathroom door
	because this time he didn't think

	he could reach the kitchen." -- Stephen Chbosky]]>
