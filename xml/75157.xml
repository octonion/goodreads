		<description>
	    <![CDATA["You only have to forgive once.  To resent, you have to do it all day, every day.  You have to keep remembering all the bad things.  I would have to make a list, a very, very long list and make sure I hated the people on it the right amount.  That I did a very proper job of hating too." -- M. L . Stedman]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I believe that if, at the end of it all, according to our abilities, we have done something to make others a little happier, and something to make ourselves a little happier, that is about the best we can do. To make others less happy is a crime. To make ourselves unhappy is where all crime starts. We must try to contribute joy to the world. That is true no matter what our problems, our health, our circumstances. We must try." -- Roger Ebert]]>
