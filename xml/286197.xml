	    <![CDATA["Your parents must feel terrible.&quot; 
&quot;Not really. Dad says all things work together for the good of the Kingdom.&quot; 
If there was a kingdom, Brig had been left out of it. He wanted to say as much, to tell her that this kingdom business was what you said when you didn't want your daughter blaming you for Brazil, except, here she stood, one-arm-happy, and Brig had the strongest sensation that it wasn't his place to say. Instead, he said: &quot;And you're sure of that? That all things work together for good?" -- David James Poissant]]>

	    <![CDATA["Anyway, I'm done with God.&quot; 
Lily smiled. &quot;But what if it's not God you're mad at?&quot; she said. &quot;What if the thing you're mad at is this idea of God, this really bad idea you got from other people. What if God exists? What if God is love? Aren't you going to feel stupid later?" -- David James Poissant]]>
