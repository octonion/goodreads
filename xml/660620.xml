		<description>
	    <![CDATA["It scares me how hard it is to remember life before you. I can't even make the comparisons anymore, because my memories of that time have all the depth of a photograph. It seems foolish to play games of better and worse. It's simply a matter of is and is no longer." -- David Levithan]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Even when I detach, I care. You can be separate from a thing and still care about it. If I wanted to detach completely, I would move my body away. I would stop the conversation midsentence. I would leave the bed. Instead, I hover over it for a second. I glance off in another direction. But I always glance back at you." -- David Levithan]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["There are times when I worry that I've already lost myself.  That is, that my self is so inseparable from being with you that if we were to separate, I would no longer be.  I save this thought for when I feel the darkest discontent.  I never meant to depend so much on someone else." -- David Levithan]]>

Last night, I got up the courage to ask you if you regretted us.
 &quot;There are things I miss,&quot; you said. &quot;But if I didn't have you, I'd miss more." -- David Levithan]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["It doesn't have to be on Valentine's Day.  It doesn't have to be by the time you turn eighteen or thirty-three or fifty-nine.  It doesn't have to conform to whatever is usual.  It doesn't have to be kismet at once, or rhapsody by the third date.
It just has to be.  In time.  In place.  In spirit.
It just has to be." -- David Levithan]]>

	    <![CDATA["A year. A thousand kisses. And now a thousand one, a thousand two. There are so many other place we could have ended up, but I have to believe
none of them would have felt this right. &quot;All I want is you&quot; is not entirely true. I want so much more, and with you I think I can get it." -- David Levithan]]>

	    <![CDATA["Maybe that's it, [...] [w]ith what you were talking about before. The world being broken. Maybe it isn't that we're supposed to find the pieces and put them back together. Maybe &lt;i&gt;we're&lt;/i&gt; the pieces.&quot; [...] &quot;Maybe [...] what we're supposed to do is come together. That's how we stop the breaking." -- David Levithan]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I keep thinking about this river somewhere, with the water moving really fast.  And these two people in the water, trying to hold onto each other, holding on as hard as they can, but in the end it's just too much.  The current's too strong.  They've got to let go, drift apart.  That's how it is with us.  It's a shame, Kath, because we've loved each other all our lives.  But in the end, we can't stay together forever." -- Kazuo Ishiguro]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["If ever there is tomorrow when we're not together... there is something you must always remember. You are braver than you believe, stronger than you seem, and smarter than you think. But the most important thing is, even if we're apart... I'll always be with you." -- A.A. Milne]]>
