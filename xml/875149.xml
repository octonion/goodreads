		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Hey, a guy can hope. I mean, it’s not impossible that a
car full of scantily clad sorority girls might break down
outside and need my help.”
“That’s true,” I said. “Maybe I can put a sign out front that
says, ‘ATTENTION ALL GIRLS: FREE HELP HERE.’”
“‘ATTENTION ALL HOT GIRLS,’” he corrected,
straightening up.
“Right,” I said, trying not to roll my eyes. “That’s an
important distinction.”
He pointed at me with the pool stick. “Speaking of hot, I
like that uniform.”
This time, I did roll my eyes." -- Richelle Mead]]>

	    <![CDATA["So, &quot; Nathan said, attention focused on Adrian, &quot;now that Vasilisa's graduated, what are you going to do with yourself? You aren't going to keep slumming with high school students, are you? There's no point in you being there anymore. &quot; 
&quot;I don't know, &quot; said Adrian lazily. &quot;I kind of like hanging out with them. They think I'm funnier than I really am. &quot; 
&quot;Unsurprising, &quot; his father replied. &quot;You aren't funny at all. It's time you do something productive. If you aren't going to go back to college, you should at least start sitting in on some of the family business meetings. Tatiana spoils you, but you could learn a lot from Rufus. &quot; 
&quot;True, &quot; said Adrian deadpan.&quot;I'd really like to know how he keeps his two mistresses a secret from his wife. &quot; 
&quot;Adrian!&quot; snapped Daniella, a flush spilling over her pale cheeks" -- Richelle Mead]]>

For now hath time made me his numbering clock: 
My thoughts are minutes; and with sighs they jar 
Their watches on unto mine eyes, the outward watch, 
Whereto my finger, like a dial's point, 
Is pointing still, in cleansing them from tears. 
Now sir, the sound that tells what hour it is 
Are clamorous groans, which strike upon my heart, 
Which is the bell: so sighs and tears and groans 
Show minutes, times, and hours." -- william shakespeare]]>
