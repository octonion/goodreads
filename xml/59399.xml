	    <![CDATA["The time of getting fame for your name on its own is over. Artwork that is only about wanting to be famous will never make you famous. Any fame is a by-product of making something that means something. You don't go to a restaurant and order a meal because you want to have a shit." -- Banksy]]>

	    <![CDATA["Invention, it must be humbly admitted, does not consist in creating out of void, but out of chaos; the materials must, in the first place be afforded: it can give form to dark shapeless substances but cannot bring into being the substance itself." -- Mary Shelley]]>

	    <![CDATA["Do not write. I am sad, and want my light put out.
Summers in your absence are as dark as a room.
I have closed my arms again. They must do without.
To knock at my heart is like knocking at a tomb.
                Do not write!

Do not write. Let us learn to die, as best we may.
Did I love you? Ask God. Ask yourself. Do you know?
To hear that you love me, when you are far away,
Is like hearing from heaven and never to go.
                Do not write!

Do not write. I fear you. I fear to remember,
For memory holds the voice I have often heard.
To the one who cannot drink, do not show water,
The beloved one's picture in the handwritten word.
                Do not write!

Do not write those gentle words that I dare not see,
It seems that your voice is spreading them on my heart,
Across your smile, on fire, they appear to me,
It seems that a kiss is printing them on my heart.
                Do not write!" -- Louis Simpson]]>

	    <![CDATA["This is perhaps a foolish risk,” she said against his ear.
“What will they do if they catch us?” He gave her a look of mock horror. “Make me marry you?”
“That would be the respectful thing to do.”
“I respect you,” he said darkly, grazing his teeth and tongue over the lace that framed her bosom. “Shall I take you upstairs and respect you over and over again?" -- Evelyn Pryce]]>
