	    <![CDATA["The only calibration that counts is how much heart people invest, how much they ignore their fears of being hurt or caught out or humiliated.

	    <![CDATA["Have you ever met a man who looked so damn delicious that you wanted to sop him up with a hot buttermilk biscuit and inhale him in one gulp?”

“Why, yes, I have,” Doris said.

That was a shocker. “Really? What happened?”

“I married him." -- Susan Donovan]]>
