	    <![CDATA["You are good. But it is not enough just to be good. You must be good for something. You must contribute good to the world. The world must be a better place for your presence. And the good that is in you must be spread to others...." -- Gordon B. Hinckley]]>

	    <![CDATA["Love is the very essence of life.  It is the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.  Yet it is not found only at the end of the rainbow.  Love is at the beginning also, and from it springs the beauty that arched across the sky on a stormy day.  Love is the security for which children weep, the yearning of youth, the adhesive that binds marriage, and the lubricant that prevents devastating friction in the home; it is the peace of old age, the sunlight of hope shining through death.  How rich are those who enjoy it in their associations with family, friends, and neighbors!  Love, like faith, is a gift of God.  It is also the most enduring and most powerful virtue." -- Gordon B. Hinckley]]>
