		<description>
	    <![CDATA["It is disappointing how people tend not to read a broad range of material. When the poets only read poetry, the historians only read history, the theorists only read theory, and the philosophers only read philosophy, we experience a clear deficiency in poetry, history, theory, and philosophy. We are far away from Renaissance human beings sculpting themselves to be full and all encompassing in knowledge and life pursuits." -- Anthony Leskov]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Con Cusano si delinea l'immagine di un universo infinitamente aperto che ha il centro dappertutto e la circonferenza in nessun luogo. Dio, in quanto infinito, supera ogni limitazione e ogni opposizione. A mano a mano che si aumenta il diametro di un cerchio, diminuisce la sua curvatura, e al limite una circonferenza infinita diventa una retta infinita: in Dio si ha la coincidenza degli opposti. Se l'universo avesse un centro, sarebbe limitato da un altro universo. Ma nell'universo Dio è centro e circonferenza. La terra non può essere il centro dell'universo." -- Umberto Eco]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["TO BE HOPEFUL in bad times is not just foolishly romantic. It is based on the fact that human history is a history not only of cruelty, but also of compassion, sacrifice, courage, kindness.
What we choose to emphasize in this complex history will determine our lives. If we see only the worst, it destroys our capacity to do something. If we remember those times and places—and there are so many—where people have behaved magnificently, this gives us the energy to act, and at least the possibility of sending this spinning top of a world in a different direction.
And if we do act, in however small a way, we don’t have to wait for some grand utopian future. The future is an infinite succession of presents, and to live now as we think human beings should live, in defiance of all that is bad around us, is itself a marvelous victory." -- Howard Zinn]]>
