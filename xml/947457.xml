But if you didn't change at least a little, where were the passages of a life?  Didn't learning, changing, sometimes mean letting go of what had once been seen as true?" -- Guy Gavriel Kay]]>

	    <![CDATA["Here are the two states in which you may exist: person who writes, or person who does not. If you write: you are a writer. If you do not write: you are not. Aspiring is a meaningless null state that romanticizes Not Writing. It’s as ludicrous as saying, “I aspire to pick up that piece of paper that fell on the floor.” Either pick it up or don’t. I don’t want to hear about how your diaper’s full. Take it off or stop talking about it." -- Chuck Wendig]]>

I smoothed a bloodied lock of hair from her eyes and felt very tired as I said, &quot;The only people who never hurt are dead.&quot;
The light died out of her eyes, her breath slowing. She whispered, barely audible, &quot;I don't understand.&quot;
I answered, &quot;I don't either.&quot;
A tear slid from her eye and mixed with the blood.
Then she died." -- Jim Butcher]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Nearly everyone underestimates how powerful the touch of another person's hand can be.  The need to be touched is something so primal, so fundamentally a part of our existence as human beings that its true impact upon us can be difficult to put into words.  That power doesn't necessarily have anything to do with sex, either.  From the time we are infants, we learn to associate the touch of a human hand with safety, with comfort, with love." -- Jim Butcher]]>

   Faith is about what you do. It's about aspiring to be better and nobler and kinder than you are. It's about making sacrifices for the good of others - even when there's not going to be anyone telling you what a hero you are." -- Jim Butcher]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["There’s power in the touch of another person’s hand. We acknowledge it in little ways, all the time. There’s a reason human beings shake hands, hold hands, slap hands, bump hands. 

“It comes from our very earliest memories, when we all come into the world blinded by light and color, deafened by riotous sound, flailing in a suddenly cavernous space without any way of orienting ourselves, shuddering with cold, emptied with hunger, and justifiably frightened and confused. And what changes that first horror, that original state of terror? 

“The touch of another person’s hands. 

“Hands that wrap us in warmth, that hold us close. Hands that guide us to shelter, to comfort, to food. Hands that hold and touch and reassure us through our very first crisis, and guide us into our very first shelter from pain. The first thing we ever learn is that the touch of someone else’s hand can ease pain and make things better. 

“That’s power. That’s power so fundamental that most people never even realize it exists." -- Jim Butcher]]>
