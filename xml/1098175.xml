If you don't, you may make a fortune in ten years, but you're not going to be read in twenty years, and that's that." -- John Champlin Gardner]]>

	    <![CDATA["I always loved English because whatever human beings are, we are storytellers.  It is our stories that give a light to the future.  When I went to college I became a history major because history is such a wonderful story of who we think we are.  English is much more a story of who we really are." -- Nikki Giovanni]]>

	    <![CDATA["I know why we try to keep the dead alive: we try to keep them alive in order to keep them with us.  I also know that if we are to live ourselves there comes a point at which we must relinquish the dead, let them go, keep them dead.  " -- Joan Didion]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I suppose I am talking about just that: the ambiguity of belonging to a generation distrustful of political highs, the historical irrelevancy of growing up convinced that the heart of darkness lay not in some error of social organization but in man's own blood. If man was bound to err, then any social organization was bound to be in error. It was a premise which still seems to me accurate enough, but one which robbed us early of a certain capacity for surprise. " -- Joan Didion]]>
