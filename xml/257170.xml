	    <![CDATA["Reading fiction is important. It is a vital means of imagining a life other than our own, which in turn makes us more empathetic beings. Following complex story lines stretches our brains beyond the 140 characters of sound-bite thinking, and staying within the world of a novel gives us the ability to be quiet and alone, two skills that are disappearing faster than the polar icecaps." -- Ann Patchett]]>

	    <![CDATA["Books help us understand who we are and how we are to behave.  They show us what community and friendship mean/ they show us how to live and die.  They are full of all the things that you don't get in real life - wonderful, lyrical language, for instance, right off the bat.  And quality of attention: we may notice amazing details during the course of a day but we rarely let ourselves stop and really pay attention.  An author makes you notice, makes you pay attention, and this is a great gift.  My gratitude for good writing is unbounded; I'm grateful for it the way I'm grateful for the ocean." -- Anne Lamott]]>

	    <![CDATA["As a bee seeks nectar from all kinds of flowers seek teachings everywhere.  Like a deer that finds a quiet place to graze seek seclusion to digest all that you have gathered.  Like a mad one beyond all limits go where you please and live like a lion completely free of all fear." -- dzogchen tantra]]>
