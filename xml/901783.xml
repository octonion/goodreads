	    <![CDATA["We women have lived too much with closure: &quot;If he notices me, if I marry him, if I get into college, if I get this work accepted, if I get this job&quot; -- there always seems to loom the possibility of something being over, settled, sweeping clear the way for contentment. This is the delusion of a passive life. When the hope for closure is abandoned, when there is an end to fantasy, adventure for women will begin." -- Carolyn G. Heilbrun]]>

	    <![CDATA["The greatest and most important problems of life are all in a certain sense insoluble…. They can never be solved, but only outgrown…. This ‘outgrowing’, as I formerly called it, on further experience was seen to consist in a new level of consciousness. Some higher or wider interest arose on the person’s horizon, and through this widening of view, the insoluble problem lost its urgency. It was not solved logically in its own terms, but faded out when confronted with a new and stronger life-tendency." -- Carl Jung]]>
