		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I wanted so many times while driving to flip, to skid and flip and fall from the car and have something happen.  I wanted to land on my head and lose half of it, or land on my legs and lose one or both.  I wanted something to happen so my choices would be fewer, so my map would have a route straight through, in red.  I wanted limitations, boundaries, to ease the burden; because the agony, Jack, when we were up there in the dark, was in the silence!  All I ever wanted was to know what to do.  In these last months I've had no clue, I've been paralyzed by the quiet, and for a moment something spoke to me, and we came here, or came to Africa, and intermittently there were answers, intermittently there was a chorus and they sang to us and pointing, and were watching and approving, but just as often there was silence, and we stood blinking under the sun, or under the black sky, and we had to think of what to do next." -- Dave Eggers]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Once there were brook trout in the streams in the mountains. You could see them standing in the amber current where the white edges of their fins wimpled softly in the flow. They smelled of moss in your hand. Polished and muscular and torsional. On their backs were vermiculate patterns that were maps of the world in its becoming. Maps and mazes. Of a thing which could not be put back. Not be made right again. In the deep glens where they lived all things were older than man and they hummed of mystery." -- Cormac McCarthy]]>

And the shape of your path was visible from the beginning." -- Cormac McCarthy]]>

I knew that that word was like the others: just a shape to fill a lack; that when the right time came, you wouldn't need a word for that any more than for pride or fear....One day I was talking to Cora. She prayed for me because she believed I was blind to sin, wanting me to kneel and pray too, because people to whom sin is just a matter of words, to them salvation is just words too." -- William Faulkner]]>
