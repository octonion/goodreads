	    <![CDATA["The trouble is that we have a bad habit, encouraged by pendants and sophisticates, of considering happiness as something rather stupid. Only pain is intellectual, only evil interesting. This is the treason of the artist: a refusal to admit the banality of evil and the terrible boredom of pain." -- Ursula K. LeGuin]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["A word about my personal philosophy.  It is anchored in optimism.  It must be, for optimism brings with it hope, a future with a purpose, and therefore, a will to fight for a better world.  Without this optimism, there is no reason to carry on.  If we think of the struggle as  aclimb up a mountain, then we must visualize a mountain with no top.  We see a top, but when we finall yreach it, the overcast rises and we find ourselves merely on a bluff.  The mountain continues on up.  Now we see the &quot;real&quot; top ahead of us, and strive for it, only to find we've reached another bluff, the top still above us. And so it goes on, interminably.
Knowing that the mountain has no top, that it is a perpetual quest from plateau to plateau, the question arises, &quot;Why the struggle, the conflict, the heartbreak, the danger, the sacrifice.  Why the constant climb?&quot;  Our answer is the same as that which a real mountain climber gives when he is asked why he does what he does.  &quot;Because it's there.&quot;  Because life is there ahead of you and either one tests oneself in its challenges or huddles in the valleys of a dreamless day-to-day existence whose only purpose is the preservation of a illusory security and safety.  The latter is what the vast majority of people choose to do, fearing the adventure into the known.  Paradocically, they give up the dream of what may lie ahead on the heighs of tomorrow for a perpetual nightmare - an endless succession of days fearing the loss of a tenuous security." -- Saul Alinsky]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["It's okay to embark on writing because you think it will get you love.  At least it gets you going, but it doesn't last.  After a while you realize that no one cares that much.  Then you find another reason:  money.  You can dream on that one while the bills pile up.  Then you think:  &quot;Well, I'm the sensitive type.  I have to express myself.&quot;  Do me a favor.  Don't be so sensitive.  Be tough.  It will get you further along when you get rejected.

Finally, you just do it because you happen to like it." -- Natalie Goldberg]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The main hallway of the Sternwood place was two stories high. Over the entrance doors, which would have let in a troop of Indian elephants, there was a broad stained-glass panel showing a knight in dark armor rescuing a lady who was tied to a tree and didn’t have any clothes on but some very long and convenient hair. The knight had pushed the vizor of his helmet back to be sociable, and he was fiddling with the knots on the ropes that tied the lady to the tree and not getting anywhere. I stood there and thought that if I lived in the house, I would sooner or later have to climb up there and help him. He didn’t seem to be really trying." -- Raymond Chandler]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["A story is not like a road to follow …  it's more like a house. You go inside and stay there for a while, wandering back and forth and settling where you like and discovering how the room and corridors relate to each other, how the world outside is altered by being viewed from these windows. And you, the visitor, the reader, are altered as well by being in this enclosed space, whether it is ample and easy or full of crooked turns, or sparsely or opulently furnished. You can go back again and again, and the house, the story, always contains more than you saw the last time. It also has a sturdy sense of itself of being built out of its own necessity, not just to shelter or beguile you." -- Alice Munro]]>
