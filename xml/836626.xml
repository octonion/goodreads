	    <![CDATA["We must remember that we are the ones we have been waiting for.  We are the ones who must speck the truth of what we know.  And if we are not healthy, if we are not filled with the joy of our work, our voices will be silenced by our own despair.

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["These people who expect to be saints in heaven, though they were not on Earth, have ignored the wisdom of the founders of the great religions.  This wisdom is that the kingdom of heaven is within you and that you do not go to heaven unless you are already in it.  The magic must be wrought by you and you alone.  God has no fairy wand to tap the pig and turn it into a swan.

People ignore this.  And those who believe in sinners burning in hell are, perhaps, not so much concerned with going to heaven as with being sure that sinners-–others-–roast forever in the flames." -- phillip jose farmer]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Learning requires a large dose if humility to offset our built-in arrogance, which is usually supported by deafness and massive ignorance.  New knowledge can prompt us to modify our beliefs.  If we want to stick to our prior convictions, we should avoid new information like the plague and close our minds to everything but the opinions that square with our own.  This is the way of censors and bookburners." -- Robert Funk]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Secrecy is the keystone to all tyranny. Not force, but secrecy and censorship. When any government or church for that matter, undertakes to say to its subjects, &quot;This you may not read, this you must not know,&quot; the end result is tyranny and oppression, no matter how holy the motives. Mighty little force is needed to control a man who has been hoodwinked in this fashion; contrariwise, no amount of force can control a free man, whose mind is free.  No, not the rack nor the atomic bomb, not anything. You can't conquer a free man; the most you can do is kill him." -- Robert A Heinlein]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I am frankly sick and tired of the political preachers telling me as a citizen that if I want to be a moral person, I must believe in A, B, C, and D.  Just who do they think they are?  And from where do they presume to claim the right to dictate their moral beliefs to me? " -- Barry Goldwater]]>
