&quot;And what is hell? Can you tell me that?&quot;

&quot;A pit full of fire.&quot;

&quot;And should you like to fall into that pit, and to be burning there for ever?&quot;

&quot;No, sir.&quot;

&quot;What must you do to avoid it?&quot;

I deliberated a moment: my answer, when it did come was objectionable: &quot;I must keep in good health and not die." -- Charlotte Brontë]]>
