		<description>
	    <![CDATA["In friendship...we think we have chosen our peers. In reality a few years' difference in the dates of our births, a few more miles between certain houses, the choice of one university instead of another...the accident of a topic being raised or not raised at a first meeting--any of these chances might have kept us apart. But, for a Christian, there are, strictly speaking no chances. A secret master of ceremonies has been at work. Christ, who said to the disciples, &quot;Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you,&quot; can truly say to every group of Christian friends, &quot;Ye have not chosen one another but I have chosen you for one another.&quot; The friendship is not a reward for our discriminating and good taste in finding one another out. It is the instrument by which God reveals to each of us the beauties of others." -- C.S. Lewis]]>

	    <![CDATA["My argument against God was that the universe seemed so cruel and unjust. But how had I got this idea of just and unjust? A man does not call a line crooked unless he has some idea of a straight line. What was I comparing this universe with when I called it unjust?" -- C.S. Lewis]]>
