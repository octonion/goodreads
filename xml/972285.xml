	    <![CDATA["and so it came to pass that i was strapped to a gurney and covered in raw liver and slabs of beef that very quickly turned rancid under the bright spotlights. there exists a videotape somewhere that documents me being wheeled about the dance floor by two burly &quot;orderlies,&quot; while i desperately search for a bathroom big enough to accommodate the stretcher so i can do a bump of cocaine. watching me retch from the decomposing meat, and simultaneously fiend for drugs, makes for an entertaining time, indeed.

when i told my mother the extremes i went to in order to make a living, she just shook her head and said, &quot;now don't you wish you'd finished college, dear?&quot;

mothers are so wise, sometimes." -- James St. James]]>
