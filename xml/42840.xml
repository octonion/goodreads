	    <![CDATA["It doesn’t matter how much you build, how many volumes you mass together, or how much ornamentation you throw onto a façade. There is always a crisp line separating something from nothing. That’s all we’re doing, in the end, defining the void." -- Dan Lopez]]>

	    <![CDATA["Though everyone had been uniformly gracious with me throughout our visit, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was being vetted in some way and that I’d already come up short. Peter was the one they wanted; I was merely the collateral—the boyfriend, the grad-school widow. I was accustomed to monopolizing Peter’s affection, but for the first time in our relationship, I felt like I’d arrived at a meeting only to find all the seats at the table filled." -- Dan Lopez]]>
