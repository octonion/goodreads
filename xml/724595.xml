		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Nothing could be purged without a bodyâ€”no crying, no exertion, no pills to take away the pain or calm me down. Nothing. Instead, something ballooned inside me until I felt like I might explode. All I could do was sit there and drown in it, wondering why Claire affected me so much, wondering if she always would." -- Courtney King Walker]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["You know, there are good reasons to learn how to read.  Poetry isn't one of them.  I mean, so what if two roads go two ways in a wood? So what? Who cares if it made all that big a difference? What difference? And why should I have to guess what the difference is?  Isn't that what he's supposed to say?

Why can't poets just say what they want to say and then shut up?" -- Gary D. Schmidt]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["(I)f you do not believe that hearts can bloom suddenly bigger, and that love can open like a flower out of even the hardest places, then I am afraid that for you the road will be long and brown and barren, and you will have trouble finding the light.
   But if you &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; believe, then you already know all about magic." -- Lauren Oliver]]>
