	    <![CDATA["And so now I'd like to say - people can change anything they want to.  And that means everything in the world.  People are running about following their little tracks - I am one of them.  But we've all got to stop just following our own little mouse trail.  People can do anything - this is something that I'm beginning to learn.  People are out there doing bad things to each other.  That's because they've been dehumanised.  It's time to take the humanity back into the center of the ring and follow that for a time.  Greed, it ain't going anywhere.  They should have that in a big billboard across Times Square.  Without people you're nothing.  That's my spiel." -- Joe Strummer]]>

	    <![CDATA["There are no birds in a formation to cut the wind, so when you fly on your own, the struggle is yours alone and you must be stronger than those in a flock. The wind blows hard. Fly." -- Timothy Gager]]>
