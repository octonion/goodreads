	    <![CDATA["Everybody has a ‘gripping stranger’ in their lives, Andy, a stranger who unwittingly possesses a bizarre hold over you. Maybe it’s the kid in cut-offs who mows your lawn or the woman wearing White Shoulders who stamps your book at the library—a stranger who, if you were to come home and find a message from them on your answering machine saying ‘Drop everything. I love you. Come away with me now to Florida,’ you’d follow them." -- Douglas Coupland]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["&lt;i&gt;Boys will be boys&lt;/i&gt;, that's what people say.  No one ever mentions how girls have to be something other than themselves altogether.  We are to stifle the same feelings that boys are encouraged to display.  We are to use gossip as a means of policing ourselves -- this way those who do succumb to sex but are not damaged by it are damaged instead by peer malice.  Girls demand a covenant because if one gives in, others will be expected to do the same.  We are to remain united in cruelty, ignorance, and aversion.  Or we are to starve the flesh from our bones, penalizing the body for its nature, castigating ourselves for advances we are powerless to prevent.  We are to make false promises then resist the attentions solicited.  Basically we are to become expert liars.  (p. 65)" -- Hilary Thayer Hamann]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["And loneliness.  I should say something of loneliness.  The panic, the sweeping hysteria that comes not when you are without others, but when you are without yourself, adrift.  I should describe the filthy province of mind, the blighted district inside, the place so crowded you cannot raise the lids of your eyes.  Your shoulders are drawn and your head has fallen and your chest is bruised by the constant assault of your heart. (p. 37)" -- Hilary Thayer Hamann]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Lying is a full time occupation, even if you tell just one, because once you tell it, you're stuck with it.  If you want to do it right, you have to visualize it, conjure the graphics, tone, and sequence of action, then relate it purposefully in the midst of seemingly spontaneous dialogue.  The more actual the lie becomes to the listener, the more actual it becomes to the teller, which is scariest of all.  Some people really get to believing their own lies." -- Hilary Thayer Hamann]]>

	    <![CDATA["This is where I falter. This is where I lose myself. This is where years invert and minutes reverse and ideas of what was good and right upend. This is where time is dispersed, thrown down like leaves or stones to be read.

It's difficult to say what really happened. I know that my heartache was indescribable, the depth of my loneliness astonishing. I know that I worked very hard, and I never intended to hurt anyone. I cannot describe a life dispossessed of happiness." -- Hilary Thayer Hamann]]>
