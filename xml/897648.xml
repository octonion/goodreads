		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I still love books. Nothing a computer can do can compare to a book. You can't really put a book on the Internet. Three companies have offered to put books by me on the Net, and I said, 'If you can make something that has a nice jacket, nice paper with that nice smell, then we'll talk.' All the computer can give you is a manuscript. People don't want to read manuscripts. They want to read books. Books smell good. They look good. You can press it to your bosom. You can carry it in your pocket." -- Ray Bradbury]]>

I carried so many home I was hunchbacked for years. Philosophy, art history, politics, social science, the poem, the essay, the grandiose play, you name 'em, I ate 'em." -- Ray Bradbury]]>

This makes readers feel hurt and worried for the characters.  The simple truth is that authors like making people squirm.  If this weren't the case, all novels would be filled completely with cute bunnies having birthday parties." -- Brandon Sanderson]]>
