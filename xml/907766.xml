	    <![CDATA["I hold my daughter in my arms and thank God for bringing her to me. If the standard route of creating a family had worked for me, I wouldn’t have met this child. I needed to know her. I needed to be her mother. I know now why all those events happened. Or didn’t happen. So I could meet this little girl. She is, in every way, my daughter. I am carrying my Funny Gift from God and all is good." -- Nia Vardalos]]>
