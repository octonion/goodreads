		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The day has been so full of fret and care, and our hearts have been so full of evil and of bitter thoughts, and the world has seemed so hard and wrong to us. Then Night, like some great loving mother, gently lays her hand upon our fevered head, and turns our little tear-stained faces up to hers, and smiles; and though she does not speak, we know what she would say, and lay our hot flushed cheek against her bosom, and the pain is gone." -- Jerome K. Jerome]]>

	    <![CDATA["I am not a smart man, particularly, but one day, at long last, I stumbled from the dark woods of my own, and my family's, and my country's past, holding in my hands these truths: that love grows from the rich loam of forgiveness; that mongrels make good dogs; that the evidence of God exists in the roundness of things. This much, at least, I've figured out. I know this much is true." -- Wally Lamb]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["We all spend so much time not saying what we want, because we know we can't have it.  And because it sounds ungracious, or ungrateful, or disloyal, or childish, or banal.  Or because we're so desperate to pretend that things are OK, really, that confessing to ourselves they're not looks like a bad move.  Go on, say what you want.  ...  Whatever it is, say it to yourself.  The truth will set you free.  Either that or it'll get you a punch in the nose.  Surviving in whatever life you're living means lying, and lying corrodes the soul, so take a break from the lies for just one minute." -- Nick Hornby]]>
