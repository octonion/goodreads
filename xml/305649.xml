		<description>
	    <![CDATA["As a general rule of biology, migratory species are less 'aggressive' than sedentary ones.

There is one obvious reason why this should be so.  The migration itself, like the pilgrimage, is the hard journey: a 'leveller' on which the 'fit' survive and stragglers fall by the wayside.

The journey thus pre-empts the need for hierarchies and shows of dominance.  The 'dictators' of the animal kingdom are those who live in an ambience of plenty.  The anarchists, as always, are the 'gentlemen of the road'." -- Bruce Chatwin]]>

	    <![CDATA["He planned for his son or daughter to have three or four toys, minimal sports equipment, and a thousand books.  He didn't care for the rhymed nonsense of Dr. Seuss, but preferred anything that instilled basic knowledge sets.  He could abide a talking animal, but not an inanimate object that spoke." -- John Brandon]]>

	    <![CDATA["Why do people keep doing stuff?&quot; he said, talking to himself it seemed.
Swin hesitated.
&quot;Wiping counters down and taking pictures.  Cheating.  Defending things.&quot;
Swin couldn't see Kyle's face.  It appeared he was about to say more, then thought better of it.  It seemed he was going to laugh or cry; of course he was going to do neither.  It was a moment of defeat, nothing more.  Kyle looked back toward the woods where he'd thrown the gun.  Swin felt he had to speak.
&quot;It's involved,&quot; he said.  &quot;Many schools of thought.  In layman's terms, being the most sophisticated monkey makes you the most confused monkey.  Taking action, any at all, is a way to alleviate that confusion.  You, you're one of the least sophisticated of us sophisticated monkeys, and therefore suffer less confusion, and have less use for the empty actions that alleviate confusion.  I don't mean that as a put-down.&quot;
Though Kyle didn't move, Swin knew he was listening, knew the explanation was somehow helping." -- John Brandon]]>

	    <![CDATA["Witches are naturally nosy,” said Miss Tick, standing up.  “Well, I must go.  I hope we shall meet again.  I will give you some free advice, though.”
“Will it cost me anything?”
“What?  I just said it was free!” said Miss Tick.
“Yes, but my father said that free advice often turns out to be expensive,” said Tiffany.
Miss Tick sniffed.  “You could say this advice is priceless,” she said, “Are you listening?”
“Yes,” said Tiffany.
“Good.  Now...if you trust in yourself...”
“Yes?”
“...and believe in your dreams...”
“Yes?”
“...and follow your star...” Miss Tick went on.
“Yes?”
“...you’ll still be beaten by people who spent their time working hard and learning things and weren’t so lazy.  Goodbye." -- Terry Pratchett]]>
