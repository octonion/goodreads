I am so afraid to open my clenched fists!
Who will I be when I have nothing left to hold on to?
Who will I be when I stand before you with empty hands?
Please help me to gradually open my hands

but what you want to give me." -- Henri J.M. Nouwen]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Compassion asks us to go where it hurts, to enter into the places of pain, to share in brokenness, fear, confusion, and anguish. Compassion challenges us to cry out with those in misery, to mourn with those who are lonely, to weep with those in tears. Compassion requires us to be weak with the weak, vulnerable with the vulnerable, and powerless with the powerless. Compassion means full immersion in the condition of being human." -- Henri J.M. Nouwen]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["To live a spiritual life we must first find the courage to enter into the desert of our loneliness and to change it by gentle and persistent efforts into a garden of solitude.  The movement from loneliness to solitude, however, is the beginning of any spiritual life because it it is the movement from the restless senses to the restful spirit,l from the outward-reaching cravings to the inward-reaching search, from the fearful clinging to the fearless play." -- Henri J.M. Nouwen]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["It is tragic to see how the religious sentiment of the West has become so individualized that concepts such as &quot;a contrite heart,&quot; have come to refer only to the personal experiences of guilt and willingness to do penance for it. The awareness of our impurity in thoughts, words and deeds can indeed put us in a remorseful mood and create in us the hope for a forgiving gesture. But if the catastrophical events of our days, the wars, mass murders, unbridled violence, crowded prisons, torture chambers, the hunger and the illness of millions of people and he unnamable misery of a major part of the human race is safely kept outside the solitude of our hearts, our contrition remains no more than a pious emotion.

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["You will lose someone you canâ€™t live without,and your heart will be badly broken, and the bad news is that you never completely get over the loss of your beloved. But this is also the good news. They live forever in your broken heart that doesnâ€™t seal back up. And you come through. Itâ€™s like having a broken leg that never heals perfectlyâ€”that still hurts when the weather gets cold, but you learn to dance with the limp." -- Anne Lamott]]>
