		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Many religions now come before us with ingratiating smirks and outspread hands, like an unctuous merchant in a bazaar. They offer consolation and solidarity and uplift, competing as they do in a marketplace. But we have a right to remember how barbarically they behaved when they were strong and were making an offer that people could not refuse." -- Christopher Hitchens]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["For those who believe in God, most of the big questions are answered. But for those of us who can't readily accept the God formula, the big answers don't remain stone-written. We adjust to new conditions and discoveries. We are pliable. Love need not be a command nor faith a dictum. I am my own god. We are here to unlearn the teachings of the church, state, and our educational system. We are here to drink beer. We are here to kill war. We are here to laugh at the odds and live our lives so well that Death will tremble to take us." -- Charles Bukowski]]>

	    <![CDATA["I feel that life is divided into the horrible and the miserable. That's the two categories. The horrible are like, I don't know, terminal cases, you know, and blind people, crippled. I don't know how they get through life. It's amazing to me. And the miserable is everyone else. So you should be thankful that you're miserable, because that's very lucky, to be miserable." -- Woody Allen]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I don't like ass kissers, flag wavers or team players. I like people who buck the system. Individualists. I often warn people: &quot;Somewhere along the way, someone is going to tell you, 'There is no &quot;I&quot; in team.' What you should tell them is, 'Maybe not. But there is an &quot;I&quot; in independence, individuality and integrity.'&quot; Avoid teams at all cost. Keep your circle small. Never join a group that has a name. If they say, &quot;We're the So-and-Sos,&quot; take a walk. And if, somehow, you must join, if it's unavoidable, such as a union or a trade association, go ahead and join. But don't participate; it will be your death. And if they tell you you're not a team player, congratulate them on being observant." -- George Carlin]]>
