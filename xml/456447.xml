That parade of red numerals on its page adds up to zero:  birthdays of politicians, a holiday reserved for rodents, what kind of celebrations are those?

It was no accident that our ancestors pinned Valentine’s Day on February’s shirt:  he or she lucky enough to have a lover in frigid, antsy February has cause for celebration, indeed." -- Tom Robbins]]>
