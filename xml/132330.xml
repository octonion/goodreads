	    <![CDATA["If a nuclear disaster occurred, and you had to live out those final painful days just stretched out somewhere thinking about your life--This is who I am.  This is what I love.  This is what I believe--who would you want hearing your whispers? Or perhaps better: Who do you trust to hear your whispers? Whose breath do you want mingled with your own?  Whose flesh still warm beside you?" -- Jill McCorkle]]>
