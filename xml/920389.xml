	    <![CDATA["Would it be possible for me to see something from up there?&quot; asked Milo politely.

&quot;You could,&quot; said Alec, &quot;but only if you try very hard to look at things as an adult does.&quot;

Milo tried as hard as he could, and, as he did, his feet floated slowly off the ground until he was standing in the air next to Alex Bings.  He looked around very quickly and, an instant later, crashed back down to the earth again.

&quot;Interesting, wasn't it?&quot; asked Alex.

&quot;Yes, it was,&quot; agreed Milo, rubbing his head and dusting himself off, &quot;but I think I'll continue to see things as a child.  It's not so far to fall." -- Norton Juster]]>

	    <![CDATA["How many slams in an old screen door? Depends how loud you shut it. How many slices in a bread? Depends how thin you cut it. How much good inside a day? Depends how good you live 'em. How much love inside a friend? Depends how much you give 'em." -- Shel Silverstein]]>

	    <![CDATA["What really knocks me out is a book that, when you're all done reading it, you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it. That doesn't happen much, though." -- J.D. Salinger]]>
