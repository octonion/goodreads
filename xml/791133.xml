	    <![CDATA["On rich soils only abundant harvests of produce for ordinary consumption grow.
     On poor soils the most misshapen trees, and flowers of the rarest, the subtlest colours and scents are to be found." -- Roger Giroux]]>

	    <![CDATA["The common prejudice that love is as common as &quot;romance&quot; may be due to the fact that we all learned about it first through poetry. But the poets fool us; they are the only ones to whom love is not only a crucial, but an indispensable experience, which entitles them to mistake it for a universal one." -- Hannah Arendt]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["All human affairs rest upon probabilities, and the same thing is true everywhere. If man were immortal he could be perfectly sure of seeing the day when everything in which he had trusted would betray his trust, and, in short, of coming eventually to hopeless misery. He would break down, at last, as every great fortune, as every dynasty, as every civilization does. In place of this we have death." -- Charles Sanders Peirce]]>
