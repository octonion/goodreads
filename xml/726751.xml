But conversely, the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man&amp;mdash;for precisely the same reasons." -- Douglas Adams]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I have a friend who feels sometimes that the world is hostile to human life--he says it chills us and kills us.  But how could we be were it not for this planet that provided our very shape?  Two conditions--gravity and a livable temperature range between freezing and boiling--have given us fluids and flesh.  The trees we climb and the ground we walk on have given us five fingers and toes.  The &quot;place&quot; (from the root plat, broad, spreading, flat) gave us far-seeing eyes, the streams and breezes gave us versatile tongues and whorly ears.  The land gave us a stride, and the lake a dive.  The amazement gave us our kind of mind.  We should be thankful for that, and take nature's stricter lessons with some grace." -- Gary Snyder]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["When despair for the world grows in me and I wake in the night at the least sound in fear of what my life and my children's lives may be, I go and lie down where the wood drake rests in his beauty on the water, and the great heron feeds. I come into the peace of wild things who do not tax their lives with forethought of grief. I come into the presence of still water. And I feel above me the day-blind stars waiting with their light. For a time I rest in the grace of the world, and am free." -- Wendell Berry]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Still, no one finally knows what a poet is supposed either to be or to do. Especially in this country, one takes on the job—because all that one does in America is considered a &quot;job&quot;—with no clear sense as to what is required or where one will ultimately be led. In that respect, it is as particular an instance of a &quot;calling&quot; as one might point to. For years I've kept in mind, &quot;Many are called but few are chosen.&quot; Even so &quot;called,&quot; there were no assurances that one would be answered." -- Robert Creeley]]>

You could say it was unfair, and that was true, but the universe didn’t care because it didn’t know what “fair” meant. That was the big problem about being a witch. It was up to you. It was always up to you." -- Terry Pratchett]]>
