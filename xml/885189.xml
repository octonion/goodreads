	    <![CDATA["The book is almost always better than  the movie. You could have no better  case in point than FROM HELL, Alan Moore's best graphic novel to date, brilliantly illustrated by Eddie  Campbell. It's hard to describe just how much better the book is.

It's like, &quot;If the movie was an episode of Battlestar Galactica with a guest appearance by the Smurfs and everyone spoke Dutch, the graphic novel is Citizen Kane with added sex scenes and music by your favourite ten bands and everyone in the world you ever hated dies at the end.&quot; 

That's how much better it is." -- Warren Ellis]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The tears I feel today
I'll wait to shed tomorrow.
Though I'll not sleep this night
Nor find surcease from sorrow.
My eyes must keep their sight:
I dare not be tear-blinded.
I must be free to talk
Not choked with grief, clear-minded.
My mouth cannot betray
The anguish that I know.
Yes, I'll keep my tears til later:
But my grief will never go." -- Anne McCaffrey]]>
