	    <![CDATA["I had hardly begun to read
I asked how can you ever be sure
that what you write is really
any good at all and he said you can't
you can't you can never be sure
you die without knowing
whether anything you wrote was any good
if you have to be sure don't write" -- W.S. Merwin]]>

	    <![CDATA["The most terrible struggle in our recent history is being played out. It is not only a struggle for our land, it is a struggle for our soul....  A thousand years of tradition suffice for a nation to learn once and for always these two things: to defend its existence, and with all its heart and all its strength to stand on the side of peace and liberty." -- Karel Capek]]>
