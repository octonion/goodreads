	    <![CDATA["If there is pain, nurse it, and if there is a flame, don't snuff it out, don't be brutal with it.  Withdrawal can be a terrible thing when it keeps us awake at night, and watching others forget us sooner than we'd want to be forgotten is no better. We rip out so much of ourselves to be cured of things faster than we should that we go bankrupt by the age of thirty and have less to offer each time we start with someone new.  But to feel nothing so as not to feel anything - what a waste! (p. 225)" -- André Aciman]]>

	    <![CDATA["I never hated you. My anger was never with you, but with the little hell my heart had put me in. The anger always passed. I never regretted loving you. If I had gone to my grave never kissing you or touching you, I still would not have thought it a wasted love." -- Madeline Hunter]]>

	    <![CDATA["Maybe I was destined to forever fall in love with people I couldn’t have. Maybe there’s a whole assortment of impossible people waiting for me to find them. Waiting to make me feel the same impossibility over and over again." -- Carol Rifka Brunt]]>

	    <![CDATA["For the first time she had dimly realized that only the hopeless are starkly sincere and that only the unhappy can either give or take sympathy--even some of the bitter and dangerous voluptuousness of misery." -- Jean Rhys]]>
