	    <![CDATA["At first the music almost repelled me, it was so intense, and this man made no attempt to sugarcoat what he was trying to say, or play.  It was hard-core, more than anything I had ever heard.  After a few listenings I realized that, on some level, I had found the master, and that following this man's example would be my life's work." -- Eric Clapton]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Look at children.  Of course they may quarrel, but generally speaking they do not harbor ill feelings as much or as long as adults do.  Most adults have the advantage of education over children, but what is the use of an education if they show a big smile while hiding negative feelings deep inside?  Children dont usually act in such a manner.  If they feel angry with someone, they express it, and then it is finished.  They can still play with that person the following day." -- His Holiness the Dahai Lama]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["To travel a circle is to journey over the same ground time and time again.  To travel a circle wisely is to journey over the same ground for the first time.  In this way, the ordinary becomes extraordinary, and the circle, a path to where you wish to be.  And when you notice at last that the path has circled back into itself, you realize that where you wish to be is where you have already been ... and always were." -- Neale Donald Walsch]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["To my mind, ‘magic’ is the hard-to-define quality of the things that stir up mystical feelings like amazement, curiosity, imagination, and above all wonder. 

Magic is that which renders something beautiful in a spiritual sense. It is that which makes one feel as if the world is more than it is presently understood to be, and yet at the same time the world is working itself out in a good and beautiful way. 

Magic underlies the relationship between us, and the greater immensities of birth and death. Thus the experience of being in the presence of something magical is an empowering, uplifting experience. Magic, understood this way, contributes meaning to life.

On the contrary, your endeavor to understand God and the nature of the universe is a testament to your devotion." -- Mark Ireland]]>
