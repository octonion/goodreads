	    <![CDATA["Stop,&quot; I said. &quot;Please do not further endorken yourself to me. You have great hair and a car that is most fly, and you have just saved me with your mad ninja driving skills, so do not sully your heroic hottie image in my mind by further reciting your nerdy scholastic agenda. Don't tell me what you're studying, Steve, tell me what's in your soul. What haunts you?&quot;
And he was like, &quot;Dude, you need to cut back on the caffeine." -- Christopher Moore]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Like so many of the bits of conversation I recall, the meanings hidden in childhood only become clear now that I write them down.  Most were just small lessons, people trying to prove their virtue to each other, but because I wasn't supposed to be listening, I made things out to be more important than they were.  Maybe that's why our childhoods seem so big, so resonant, while our adult years slip by like fish in the river Byk." -- Elana Dykewomon]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["When you're eleven you think every idea is born with you, that no one ever tried it the right way before.  Your example, your own honesty, will make you a hero to everyone who knows you - and better, it will make people come to their senses and stop telling vicious lies about each other." -- Elana Dykewomon]]>

	    <![CDATA["I remember that we are all young, and I feel youngness in me, that I can keep trying.  You can try a hundred things in your life, and if nothing in those hundred makes you satisfied, you can still go on trying." -- Elana Dykewomon]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Wishes of one's old life wither and shrivel like old leaves if they are not replaced with new wishes when the world changes. And the world always changes. Wishes get slimy, and their colors fade, and soon they are just mud, like all the rest of the mud, and not wishes at all, but regrets. The trouble is, not everyone can tell when they ought to launder their wishes. Even when one finds oneself in Fairyland and not at home at all, it is not always so easy to remember to catch the world in it's changing and change with it." -- Catherynne M. Valente]]>
