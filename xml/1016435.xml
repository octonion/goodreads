		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Should any political party attempt to abolish social security  unemployment insurance  and eliminate labor laws and farm programs  you would not hear of that party again in our political history.

Their number is negligible and they are stupid." -- Dwight D. Eisenhower]]>
