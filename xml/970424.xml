	    <![CDATA["I hated that the soldier doll had my name. I mean, please. I didn't play with him much. He was another Christmas present from my clueless grandparents. One time when they were visiting, my grandpa asked me if G.I. Joe had been in any wars lately. I said, &quot;No, but he and Ken got married last week.&quot; Every Christmas since then, my grandparents have sent me a check." -- James Howe]]>
