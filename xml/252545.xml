	    <![CDATA["I said to him, &quot;State your business, mortal!&quot; There was no need for me to call him &quot;mortal&quot; or to speak like a sixteenth-century knight. It just sounded cool." -- Alan Goldsher]]>

	    <![CDATA["George Harrison: The day after the Blue Angel audition, John showed up to rehearsal with a long list of name suggestions, and I remember each and every one of them: the Deads-men, the Deadmen, the Undeads-men, the Undeadmen, the Rots, the Rotters, the Dirts, the Dirty Ones, the Grayboys, the Eaten Brains, the Eating Brains, the Mersey Beaters, the Mersey Beaten, the Bloodless, the Graves, the Headstones, and the Liverpools of Blood. Paul ripped off John's right arm and used it to slap John across the face, then he said, &quot;Those're horrible, mate, just horrible, y'know." -- alan goldsher]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["George Harrison: Paul transformed me in my bedroom, and it was awkward, to say the least. It was like being on a blind date, complete with stilted conversation and elliptical innuendo. He said, &quot;So.&quot; Then I said, &quot;So.&quot; Then he said, &quot;So.&quot; Then I said, &quot;So.&quot; That went on for, I dunno, five minutes or something." -- Alan Goldsher]]>

	    <![CDATA["George had taken off all ten of his fingers and tied them into a bundle with what appeared to be either his own small intestines, or a guitar string; as I walked into the room, he lovingly placed the bundle on his head." -- Alan Goldsher]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["John Lennon: The only reason I didn't torture Dick Rowe was because Paul asked me not to. And when Paulie gives you those sad puppy-dog eyes, well, it's hard to refuse him...and it has nothing to do with hypnosis. There's a reason people call him the Cute fookin' Beatle." -- Alan Goldsher]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Before John could even get through the first verse, who bursts through the door and jumps right into the fray, lips a'kissin' and hips a'wigglin'? That's right, kids, everbody's favorite zombie hunter. Mick Jagger strode right up to John, raised his arms to the sky, and said, 'O zombie Lennon! It ends here." -- Alan Goldsher]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["After John gave his little speech to the orchestra, he turned to Paulie and said, &quot;What do you think, mate? Are you with me or not.&quot; Paul said, &quot;Not. You're on your own.&quot; John said, &quot;No, I'm not on my own. You're with me. I was being rhetorical. It wasn't a question.&quot; Paul said, &quot;Yes, it was. You said, 'Are you with me or not?' You started your sentence with the word 'are'. By definition, any sentence with the word 'are' at the beginning of it is a question.&quot; John said, &quot;That's not necessarily true. I didn't upturn my voice, and if there's no upturn, there's no question." -- Alan Goldsher]]>
