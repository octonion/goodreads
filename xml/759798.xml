	    <![CDATA["Idleness, we are accustomed to say, is the root of all evil. To prevent this evil, work is recommended.... Idleness as such is by no means a root of evil; on the contrary, it is truly a divine life, if one is not bored...." -- Soren Kierkegaard]]>

	    <![CDATA["Never wants to what?”
Meet anybody for a &lt;i&gt;drink&lt;/i&gt;. Oh, he had to go out last night and meet this television writer for a drink downtown, in the Village and all. That’s what started it. He says the only people he ever really wants to meet for a drink somewhere are all either dead or unavailable. He says he never even wants to have &lt;i&gt;lunch&lt;/i&gt; with anybody, even, unless he thinks there’s a &lt;i&gt;good chance&lt;/i&gt; it’s going to turn out to be Jesus, the person – or the Buddha, or Hui-neng, or Shankaracharya, or somebody like that. You know." -- J.D. Salinger]]>

	    <![CDATA["Why is failure the first thing I think of when I find myself in this sort of situation? Why can't I just enjoy myself? But if you have to ask the question, then you know you're lost: self-consciousness is a man's worst enemy. Already I'm wondering whether she's as aware of my erection as I am..." -- Nick Hornby]]>
