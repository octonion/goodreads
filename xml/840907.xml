	    <![CDATA["THE BAGPIPE WHO DIDN'T SAY NO  
It was nine o'clock at midnight at a quarter after three 
When a turtle met a bagpipe on the shoreside by the sea, 
And the turtle said, &quot;My dearie, 
May I sit with you? I'm weary.&quot; 
And the bagpipe didn't say no. 
Said the turtle to the bagpipe, &quot;I have walked this lonely shore, 
I have talked to waves and pebbles--but I've never loved before. 
Will you marry me today, dear? 
Is it 'No' you're going to say dear?&quot;
But the bagpipe didn't say no. 

Said the turtle to his darling, &quot;Please excuse me if I stare, 
But you have the plaidest skin, dear, 
And you have the strangest hair.
If I begged you pretty please, love, 
Could I give you just one squeeze, love?&quot; 
And the bagpipe didn't say no. 

Said the turtle to the bagpipe, &quot;Ah, you love me. Then confess! 
Let me whisper in your dainty ear and hold you to my chest.&quot; 
And he cuddled her and teased her 
And so lovingly he squeezed her. 
And the bagpipe said, &quot;Aaooga.&quot; 

Said the turtle to the bagpipe, &quot;Did you honk or bray or neigh? 
For 'Aaooga' when your kissed is such a heartless thing to say. 
Is it that I have offended? 
Is it that our love is ended?&quot; 
And the bagpipe didn't say no. 

Said the turtle to the bagpipe, &quot;Shall i leave you, darling wife? 
Shall i waddle off to Woedom? Shall i crawl out of your life? 
Shall I move, depart and go, dear-- 
Oh, I beg you tell me 'No' dear!&quot; 
But the bagpipe didn't say no. 

So the turtle crept off crying and he ne'er came back no more, 
And he left the bagpipe lying on that smooth and sandy shore. 
And some night when tide is low there, 
Just walk up and say, &quot;Hello, there,&quot; 
And politely ask the bagpipe if this story's really so. 
I assure you, darling children, the bagpipe won't say &quot;No." -- Shel Silverstein]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["When adults say, &quot;Teenagers think they are invincible&quot; with that sly, stupid smile on their faces, they don't know how right they are. We need never be hopeless, because we can never be irreparably broken. We think that we are invincible because we are. We cannot be born, and we cannot die. Like all energy, we can only change shapes and sizes and manifestations. They forget that when they get old. They get scared of losing and failing. But that part of us greater than the sum of our parts cannot begin and cannot end, and so it cannot fail." -- John Green]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["If for one minute you think you're better than a sixteen year old girl in a Green Day t-shirt, you are sorely mistaken. Remember the first time you went to a show and saw your favorite band. You wore their shirt, and sang every word. You didn't know anything about scene politics, haircuts, or what was cool. All you knew was that this music made you feel different from anyone you shared a locker with. Someone finally understood you. This is what music is about." -- Gerard Way]]>

	    <![CDATA["Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do." -- Apple Computer Inc.]]>
