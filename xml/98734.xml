	    <![CDATA["From Orient Point

The art of living isn't hard to muster:
Enjoy the hour, not what it might portend.
When someone makes you promises, don't trust her

unless they're in the here and now, and just her
willing largesse free-handed to a friend.
The art of living isn't hard to muster:

groom the old dog, her coat gets back its luster;
take brisk walks so you're hungry at the end.
When someone makes you promises, don't trust her

to know she can afford what they will cost her
to keep until they're kept. Till then, pretend
the art of living isn't hard to muster.

Cooking, eating and drinking are a cluster
of pleasures. Next time, don't go round the bend
when someone makes you promises. Don't trust her

past where you'd trust yourself, and don't adjust her
words to mean more to you than she'd intend.
The art of living isn't hard to muster.

You never had her, so you haven't lost her
like spare house keys. Whatever she opens,
when someone makes you promises, don't. Trust your
art; go on living: that's not hard to muster." -- Marilyn Hacker]]>

	    <![CDATA["On Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell in &lt;i&gt;His Girl Friday&lt;/i&gt;:

&quot;These two simply &lt;i&gt;appreciate&lt;/i&gt; one another more than either of them appreciates anyone else, and they would rather be appreciated by one another more than by anyone else. They just are &lt;i&gt;at home&lt;/i&gt; with one another, whether or not they can ever live together under the same roof -- that is, ever find a roof they can live together under." -- Stanley Cavell]]>
