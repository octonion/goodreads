	    <![CDATA["The strangeness of Time.  Not in its passing, which can seem infinite, like a tunnel whose end you can't see, whose beginning you've forgotten, but in the sudden realization that something finite, has passed, and is irretrievable." -- Joyce Carol Oates]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Very likely Miss Binny was right to a great extent.  It &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; the pretty face which creates sympathy in the hearts of men, those wicked rogues.  A woman may possess the wisdom and chastity of Minerva, and we give no heed to her, if she has a plain face.  What folly will not a pair of bright eyes make pardonable?  What dulness may not red lips and sweet accents render pleasant?  And so, with their usual sense of justice, ladies argue that because a woman is handsome, therefore she is a fool.  Oh, ladies, ladies!  some there are of you who are neither handsome nor wise." -- William Makepeace Thackeray]]>

	    <![CDATA["We closed the deal and moved to New York.
Where in fact I had lived before, from the time I was twenty-one and just out of the English Department at Berkeley and starting work at Vogue (a segue so profoundly unnatural that when I was asked by the CondÃ© Nast personnel department to name the languages in which I was fluent I could think only of Middle English) until I was twenty-nine and just married." -- Joan Didion]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The French called this time of day 'l'heure bleue.'  To the English it was 'the gloaming.'  The very word 'gloaming' reverberates, echoes - the gloaming, the glimmer, the glitter, the glisten, the glamour - carrying in its consonants the images of houses shuttering, gardens darkening, grass-lined rivers slipping through the shadows. During the blue nights you think the end of the day will never come.  As the blue nights draw to a close (and they will, and they do) you experience an actual chill, an apprehension of illness, at the moment you first notice; the blue light is going, the days are already shortening, the summer is gone... Blue nights are the opposite of the dying of the brightness, but they are also its warning." -- Joan Didion]]>
