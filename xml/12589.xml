	    <![CDATA["In a way, it's nice to know that there are Greek gods out there, because you have somebody to blame when things go wrong. For instance, when you're walking away from a bus that's just been attacked by monster hags and blown up by lightning, and it's raining on top of everything else, most people might think that's just really bad luck; when you're a half-blood, you understand that some devine force is really trying to mess up your day." -- Rick Riordan]]>

	    <![CDATA["I add my oath of protection to the bone,' he said in a whisper. 'To you now and to any child you may bear in the future. I would trade no day I spend with you for a life of safe slavery. I accepted the post of Seeker of my own free will. And if Darken Rahl takes the whole world into madness, then we will die with a sword in our hands, not chains on our wings. We will not allow it to be easy for them to kill us; they will pay a high price. We will fight with our last breath if need be, and in our death, let us inflict a wound on him that will fester until it claims him." -- Terry Goodkind]]>

&quot;D'you think you managed to get all the signs?&quot; said James in tones of mock concern.
&quot;Think I did,&quot; said Lupin seriously, as they joined the crowd thronging around the front doors eager to get out into the sunlit grounds. &quot;One: He's sitting on my chair. Two: He's wearing my clothes. Three: His name's Remus Lupin..." -- J.K. Rowling]]>

	    <![CDATA["We won't be seeing you,&quot; Fred told Professor Umbridge, swinging his leg over his broomstick.

&quot;Yeah, don't bother to keep in touch,&quot; said George, mounting his own.  

Fred looked around at the assembled students, and at the silent, watchful crowd. &quot;If anyone fancies buying a Portable Swamp, as demonstrated upstairs, come to number ninety-three, Diagon Alley — Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes,&quot; he said in a loud voice, &quot;Our new premises!&quot;

&quot;Special discounts to Hogwarts students who swear they're going to use our products to get rid of this old bat,&quot; added George, pointing at Professor Umbridge.

&quot;STOP THEM!&quot; shrieked Umbridge, but it was too late. As the Inquisitorial Squad closed in, Fred and George kicked off from the floor, shooting fifteen feet into the air, the iron peg swinging dangerously below. Fred looked across the hall at the poltergeist bobbing on his level above the crowd.

&quot;Give her hell from us, Peeves.&quot;
And Peeves, who Harry had never seen take an order from a student before, swept his belled hat from his head and sprang to a salute as Fred and George wheeled about to tumultuous applause from the students below and sped out of the open front doors into the glorious sunset." -- J.K. Rowling]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["By my love for you. I realized I loved you more than life itself, and I would rather give myself into your power than live without you. Nothing the magic could do to me could be worse than living without you. I was willing to give it all over to you. I offered the power everything I have. All of my love for you. Once I realized how much I loved you, I was willing to be yours on any terms. I understood that there could be nothing for the magic to harm. I’m already devoted to you; it didn’t need to change me. I was protected, because I have already been untouched by your love. I had utter faith that you felt the same, and had no fear of what would happen. Had I had any doubt, the magic would have latched on to that crack and taken me, but I had no doubt. My love for you is smooth and seamless. My love for you protected me from the magic." -- Terry Goodkind]]>

	    <![CDATA["I looked across the river to Manhattan. It was a great view. When Sadie and I had first arrived at Brooklyn House, Amos had told us that magicians tried to stay out of Manhattan. He said Manhattan had other problems--whatever that meant. And sometimes when I looked across the water, I could swear I was seeing things. Sadie laughed about it, but once I thought I saw a flying horse. Probably just the mansion's magic barriers causing optical illusions, but still, it was weird." -- Rick Riordan]]>

	    <![CDATA["You can do this&quot; I murmured. &quot;You are my brother. I love you. All the embarrassing bits, all the annoying bits, which I imagine is most of you--a thousand Zias might run away from you if they knew the truth. But I won't. I'll still be here." -- Rick Riordan]]>

	    <![CDATA["Hello Ra,&quot; he said in a kindly voice. &quot;It's been a long time.&quot; 
A feeble voice from behind the chair said,&quot;Can't play. Go away.&quot; 
&quot;would you like a treat?&quot; Apophis asked. &quot;we used to play so nicely together. Every night, trying to kill each other. Don't you remember?&quot;
Ra poked his head above the throne. &quot;Treat?&quot;
&quot;How about a stuffed date?&quot; Apophis pulled one out of the air. &quot;You used to love stuffed dates, didn't you? All you have to do is come out and let me devour— I mean entertain you.&quot;
&quot; Want a cookie,&quot; Ra said.
&quot;What kind?&quot;
&quot;Weasel cookie.&quot;
I'm here to tell you, that comment about weasel cookies probably saved the known universe." -- Rick Riordan]]>
