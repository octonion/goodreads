	    <![CDATA["If ever there is tomorrow when we're not together... there is something you must always remember. You are braver than you believe, stronger than you seem, and smarter than you think. But the most important thing is, even if we're apart... I'll always be with you." -- A.A. Milne]]>

	    <![CDATA["What do you like doing best in the world, Pooh?&quot;
&quot;Well,&quot; said Pooh, &quot;what I like best-&quot; and then he had to stop and think. Because although Eating Honey &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; a very good thing to do, there was a moment just before you began to eat it which was better than when you were, but he didn't know what it was called. And then he thought that being with Christopher Robin was a very good thing to do, and having Piglet near was a very friendly thing to have; and so, when he had thought it all out, he said, &quot;What I like best in the whole world is Me and Piglet going to see You, and You saying 'What about a little something?' and Me saying, 'Well, I shouldn't mind a little something, should you, Piglet,' and it being a hummy sort of day outside, and birds singing.&quot;
&quot;I like that too,&quot; said Christopher Robin, &quot;but what I like &lt;i&gt;doing&lt;/i&gt; best is Nothing." -- A.A. Milne]]>
