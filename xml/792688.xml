	    <![CDATA["Sirrah, my companion chooses to engage you in knightly combat!&quot; Halt said. The horseman stiffened, sitting upright in his saddle. Halt noticed that he nearly lost his balance at this unexpected piece of news.
Nightly cermbat?&quot; he replied, &quot;Yewer cermpenion ers no knight!&quot;
Halt nodded hugely, making sure the man could see the gesture.
Oh yes he is!&quot; he called back. &quot;He is Sir Horace of the Order of the Feuille du Chene.&quot; He paused and muttered to himself, &quot;Or should that have been Crepe du Chene? Never mind.&quot;
What did you tell him?&quot; Horace asked, slinging his buckler around from where it hung at his back and setting it on his left arm.
I said you were Sir Horace of the Order of the Oakleaf.&quot; Halt said to him, then added uncertainly, &quot;At least, I think that's what I told him. I may have said you were of the Order of the Oak Pancake." -- John Flanagan]]>
