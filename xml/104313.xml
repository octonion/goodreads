	    <![CDATA["When last I checked, you were a sorcerer, not a Jedi.&quot;
&quot;You've seen Star Wars?&quot;
&quot;Seen it and denounced it.&quot;
&quot;You've denounced Star Wars?&quot;
She looked me straight in the eye and said, &quot;Hollywood should not glorify witches.&quot;
&quot;I think you've missed the point...&quot;
&quot;I also denounce Harry Potter.&quot;
&quot;Really?&quot;
&quot;Yes.&quot;
&quot;Because...&quot;
&quot;...because literature, especially children's literature, should not glorify witches.&quot;
&quot;Oda, what do you do for fun?&quot;
She thought about it, then said, without a jot of humor, &quot;I denounce things." -- Kate Griffin]]>

	    <![CDATA["Maybe you can afford to wait. Maybe for you there's a tomorrow. Maybe for you there's one thousand tomorrows, or three thousand, or ten, so much time you can bathe in it, roll around it, let it slide like coins through you fingers. So much time you can waste it.
But for some of us there's only today. And the truth is, you never really know." -- Lauren Oliver]]>
