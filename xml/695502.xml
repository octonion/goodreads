		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Imagine that Jesus is calling you today. He extends a second invitation to accept His Father's love. And maybe you answer, &quot;Oh, I know that. It's old hat.&quot;

And God answers, 'No, that's what you don't know. You don't know how much I love you. The moment you think you understand is the moment you do not understand. I am God, not man. You tell others about Me - your words are glib. My words are written in the blood of My only Son. The next time you preach about My love with such obnoxious familiarity, I may come and blow your whole prayer meeting apart.

Did you know that every time you tell Me you love Me, I say thank you?" -- Brennan Manning]]>

You are in a safe place.&quot;

	    <![CDATA["Justification by grace through faith' is the theologian's learned phrase for what Chesterton once called 'the furious love of G-d.' He is not moody or capricious; He knows no seasons of change. He has a single relentless stance toward us: He loves us. He is the only G-d man has ever heard of who loves sinners. False gods- the gods of human manufacturing- despise sinners, but the Father of (Yeshua) loves all, no matter what they do." -- Brennan Manning]]>
