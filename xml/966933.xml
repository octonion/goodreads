	    <![CDATA["Parting is inevitably painful, even for a short time. It's like an amputation, I feel a limb is being torn off, without which I shall be unable to function. And yet, once it is done... life rushes back into the void, richer, more vivid and fuller than before. " -- Anne Morrow Lindbergh]]>

	    <![CDATA["Isn't it weird,&quot; I said, &quot;the way you remember things, when someone's gone?&quot;
What do you mean?&quot;
I ate another piece of waffle. &quot;When my dad first died, all I could think about was that day. It's taken me so long to be able to think back to before that, to everything else.&quot;
Wes was nodding before I even finished. &quot;It's even worse when someone's sick for a long time,&quot; he said. &quot;You forget they were ever healthy, ever okay. It's like there was never a time when you weren't waiting for something awful to happen.&quot;
But there was,&quot; I said. &quot;I mean, it's only been in the last few months that I've started remembering all this good stuff, funny stuff about my dad. I can't believe I ever forgot it in the first place.&quot;
You didn't forget,&quot; Wes said, taking a sip of his water. &quot;You just couldn't remember right then. But now you're ready to, so you can.&quot;
I thought about this as I finished off my waffle." -- Sarah Dessen]]>

	    <![CDATA["I'm coming back into focus when Caesar asks him if he has a girlfriend back home. Peeta hesitates, then gives an unconvincing shake of his head.

Handsome lad like you. There must be some special girl. Come on, what’s her name?&quot; says Caesar.

Peeta sighs. &quot;Well, there is this one girl. I’ve had a crush on her ever since I can remember. But I’m pretty sure she didn’t know I was alive until the reaping.&quot;

Sounds of sympathy from the crowd. Unrequited love they can relate to.

She have another fellow?&quot; asks Caesar.

I don’t know, but a lot of boys like her,&quot; says Peeta.

So, here’s what you do. You win, you go home. She can’t turn you down then, eh?&quot; says Caesar encouragingly.

I don’t think it’s going to work out. Winning...won’t help in my case,&quot; says Peeta.

Why ever not?&quot; says Caesar, mystified.

Peeta blushes beet red and stammers out. &quot;Because...because...she came here with me." -- Suzanne Collins]]>
