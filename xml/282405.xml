		<description>
	    <![CDATA["So do we pass the ghosts that haunt us later in our lives; they sit undramatically by the roadside like poor beggars, and we see them only from the corners of our eyes, if we see them at all. The idea that they have been waiting there for us rarely if ever crosses our minds. Yet they do wait, and when we have passed, they gather up their bundles of memory and fall in behind, treading in our footsteps and catching up, little by little." -- Stephen King]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Writers remember everything...especially the hurts.  Strip a writer to the buff, point to the scars, and he'll tell you the story of each small one.  From the big ones you get novels.  A little talent is a nice thing to have if you want to be a writer, but the only real requirement is the ability to remember the story of every scar.
Art consists of the persistence of memory." -- Stephen King]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Because guys like us, Red, we know there's a third choice. An alternative to staying simon-pure and bathing in the filth and the slime. It's the alternative that grown-ups all over the world pick. You balance off the walk through the hog-wallow against what it gains you. You choose the lesser of the two evils and try to keep your good intentions in front of you. And I guess you judge how well you are doing by how well you sleep at night...and what your dreams are like." -- Stephen King Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption]]>
