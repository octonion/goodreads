	    <![CDATA["I'll never know, and neither will you, of the life you don't choose. We'll only know that whatever that sister life was, it was important and beautiful and not ours. It was the ghost ship that didn't carry us. There's nothing to do but salute it from the shore." -- Cheryl Strayed]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Libraries are sanctuaries from the world and command centers onto it: here in the quiet rooms are the lives of Crazy Horse and Aung San Suu Kyi, the Hundred Years' War and the Opium Wars and the Dirty War, the ideas of Simone Weil and Lao-Tzu, information on building your sailboat or dissolving your marriage, fictional worlds and books to equip the reader to reenter the real world.  They are, ideally, places where nothing happens and where everything that has happened is stored up to be remembered and relived, the place where the world is folded up into boxes of paper.  Every book is a door that opens onto another world, which might be the magic that all those children's books were alluding to, and a library is a Milky Way of worlds." -- Rebecca Solnit]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Wherever you are, with whatever means you have, if you reclaim a piece of land for nature, your world will grow kinder, more benevolent.  Create havens - for animals, for other people, for yourself - and let this reflect into the world.  Fight for space in your own backyard, in an acre or a flowerpot or simply an embrace of the longing for company that lingers in your wilting heart.  If you take this one step toward them, no matter where you are, the elephants will come to you." -- Boyd Varty]]>
