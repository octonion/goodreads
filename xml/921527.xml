	    <![CDATA["Alice laughed. 'There's no use trying,' she said. 'One can't believe impossible things.'

	    <![CDATA["Where you come from is gone, where you thought you were going to was never there, and where you are is no good unless you can get away from it.  Where is there a place for you to be?  No place... Nothing outside you can give you any place... In yourself right now is all the place you've got." -- Flannery O'Connor ]]>
