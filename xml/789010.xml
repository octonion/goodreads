Not all those who wander are lost;

A light from the shadows shall spring;
Renewed shall be blade that was broken,
The crownless again shall be king." -- J.R.R. Tolkien]]>

In a word, to let the spiritual unbidden and unconscious grow up through the common. This is to be my symphony." -- William Henry Channing]]>
