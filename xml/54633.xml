	    <![CDATA["It seems to me, that this, too, is how memory works.  What we remember of what was done to us shapes our view, molds us, sets our stance.  But what we remember is past, it no longer exists, and yet we hold on to it, live by it, surrender so much control to it.  What do we become when we put down the scripts written by history and memory, when each person before us can be seen free of the cultural or personal narrative we've inherited or devised?
When we, ourselves, can taste that freedom." -- Rebecca Walker]]>
