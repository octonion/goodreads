		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The central question is, is this guy right? Or is he mad? What do you, the reader, think about this? Which struck me as a properly anarchist solution. I didn't want to tell people what to think, I just wanted to tell people to think and consider some of these admittedly extreme little elements, which nevertheless do recur fairly regularly throughout human history." -- Alan Moore]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["But just now, he'd gotten on his knees and proposed marriage, like in a television commercial for a diamond ring. Except of course they had the roll of duct tape instead, which, when you came to think about it, was a far more practical item. Such a bad mistake it would be, to embark on marriage and adult life without a nice supply of duct tape." -- Nancy Werlin]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["He began to cry, not hysterically or screaming as people cry when concealed rage with tears, but with continuous sobs who has just discovered that he's alone and will be for long. He cried because safety and reason seemed to have left the world. Loneliness was a reality, but in this situation madness was also remotely a possibility." -- Stephen King]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The world is quieter now. It is never quiet, but it can get quieter. What strange creatures we are, to find silence peaceful, when permanent silence is the thing we most dread. Nighttime is not that. Nighttime still rustles, still creaks and whispers and trembles in its throat. It is not darkness we fear, but our own helplessness within it. How merciful to have been granted the other senses." -- David Levithan]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I do not understand exactly what you mean by fear,&quot; said Tarzan. &quot;Like lions, fear is a different thing  in different men, but to me the only pleasure in the hunt is the knowledge that the hunted thing has power to harm me as much as I have to harm him. If I went out with a couple of rifles and a gun bearer, and twenty or thirty beaters, to hunt a lion, I should not feel that the lion had much chance, and so the pleasure of the hunt would be lessened in proportion to the increased safety which I felt.&quot;

&quot;Then I am to take it that Monsieur Tarzan would prefer to go naked into the jungle, armed only with a jackknife, to kill the king of beasts,&quot; laughed the other good naturedly, but with the merest touch of sarcasm in his tone.

&quot;And a piece of rope,&quot; added Tarzan." -- Edgar Rice Burroughs]]>

I am the mightiest of the jungle fighters. You are Jane Porter, I saw it in your letter. When you see this you will know that it is for you and that Tarzan of the Apes loves you." -- Edgar Rice Burroughs]]>

	    <![CDATA["Never did tombs look so ghastly white.  Never did cypress, or yew, or juniper so seem the embodiment of funeral gloom.  Never did tree or grass wave or rustle so ominously.  Never did bough creak so mysteriously, and never did the far-away howling of dogs send such a woeful presage through the night." -- Bram Stoker]]>

	    <![CDATA["Why must people kneel down to pray? If I really wanted to pray I’ll tell you what I'd do. I'd go out into a great big field all alone or in the deep, deep woods and I'd look up into the sky—up—up—up—into that lovely blue sky that looks as if there was no end to its blueness. And then I'd just feel a prayer." -- L.M. Montgomery]]>
