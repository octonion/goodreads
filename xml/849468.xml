		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Sometimes I'd see my father, walking past my building on his way to another nowhere. I could have given him a key, offered a piece of my floor. A futon. A bed. But I never did. If I let him inside I would become him, the line between us would blur, my own slow-motion car wreck would speed up. The slogan on the side of a moving company truck read TOGETHER WE ARE GOING PLACES--modified by a vandal or a disgruntled employee to read TOGETHER WE ARE GOING DOWN. If I went to the drowning man the drowning man would pull me under. I couldn't be his life raft." -- Nick Flynn]]>

	    <![CDATA["I offer Emily half of my hit of acid- Love Saves the Day.  It's my second or third time tripping, Emily's first, and she's understandably trepid.  Awake all night, at one point I find her touching her reflection in a cruelly lit dorm bathroom, asking if she'll ever be the same.  I kiss her then for the first time and whisper, No." -- Nick Flynn]]>

	    <![CDATA["By the time I make my way to the border of Mauritania, to the edge of the Sahara, I see no end to being lost.  You can spend your entire life simply falling in that direction.  It isn't a station you reach but just the general state of going down.  Once you make it back, if you make it back, you will stand before your long-lost friends but in some essential way they will no longer know you." -- Nick Flynn]]>

	    <![CDATA["No matter how careful you are, there's going to be the sense you missed something, the collapsed feeling under your skin that you didn't experience it all. There's that fallen heart feeling that you rushed right through the moments where you should've been paying attention.
Well, get used to that feeling. That's how your whole life will feel some day.
This is all practice." -- Chuck Palahniuk]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The cliche had it that kids were the future, but that wasn't it: they were the unreflective, active present.  They were not themselves nostalgic, because they couldn't be, and they retarded nostalgia in their parents.  Even as they were getting sick and being bullied and becoming addicted to heroin and getting pregnant, they were in the moment, and she wanted to be in it with them.  She wanted to worry herself sick about schools and bullying and drugs." -- Nick Hornby]]>

	    <![CDATA["She was trying to say something else; she was trying to say that the inability to articulate what one feels in any satisfactory way is one of our enduring tragedies.  It wouldn't have been much, and it wouldn't have been useful, but it would have been something that reflected the gravity and the sadness inside her.  Instead, she had snapped at him for being a loser.  It was as if she were trying to find a handhold on the boulder of her feelings, and had merely ended up with grit under her nails." -- Nick Hornby]]>

	    <![CDATA["What came first--the music or the misery? Did I listen to music because I was miserable? Or was I miserable because I listened to music? Do all those records turn you into a melancholy person?  People worry about kids playing with guns, and teenagers watching violent videos; we are scared that some sort of culture of violence will take them over. Nobody worries about kids listening to thousands-- literally thousands-- of songs about broken hearts and rejection and pain and misery and loss." -- Nick Hornby]]>
