	    <![CDATA["Colon has always thought that heroes had some special kind of clockwork that made them go out and die famously for god, country and apple pie, or whatever particular delicacy their mother made.  It had never occurred to him that they might do it because they'd get yelled at if they didn't." -- Terry Pratchett]]>

	    <![CDATA["Until a man is twenty-five, he still thinks, every so often, that under the right circumstances he could be the baddest motherfucker in the world. If I moved to a martial-arts monastery in China and studied real hard for ten years. If my family was wiped out by Colombian drug dealers and I swore myself to revenge. If I got a fatal disease, had one year to live, and devoted it to wiping out street crime. If I just dropped out and devoted my life to being bad." -- Neal Stephenson]]>

	    <![CDATA["&lt;u&gt;Rules for Living by Olivia Joules&lt;/U&gt;
1. Never panic.  Stop, breathe, think.
2. No one is thinking about you.  They're thinking about themselves, just like you.
3. Never change haircut or color before an important event.
4. Nothing is either as bad or good as it seems.
5. Do as you would be done by, e.g. thou shalt not kill.
6. It is better to buy one expensive thing that you really like than several cheap ones that you only quite like.
7. Hardly anything matters: if you get upset, ask yourself, &quot;Does it really matter?&quot;
8. The key to success lies in how you pick yourself up from failure.
9. Be honest and kind.
10. Only buy clothes that make you feel like doing a small dance.
11. Trust your instincts, not your overactive imagination.
12. When overwhelmed by disaster, check if it's really a disaster by doing the following: (a) think, &quot;Oh, fuck it,&quot; (b) look on the bright side, and if that doesn't work, look on the funny side.  If neither of the above works then maybe it is a disaster so turn to items 1 and 4.
13. Don't expect the world to be safe or life to be fair." -- Helen Fielding]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["What's important about morality in politics is us.  We own the chicken farm.  We must give our bird-brained, feather-headed politicians morals.  Politicians love to think of themselves as &quot;free-range&quot; but they do not have the capacity to hunt or gather morals in the wild.  If we fail to supply them with morality, politicians begin to act very scary in the barnyard.  These are enormous headless chickens and they have nukes." -- P.J. O'Rourke]]>

They drank mulled wine from thermos flasks and smoked their cigarettes hastily, as if they might warm them up.  Tamara doesn't know when the cold took hold of them.  They feel it much more quickly now, the whine more, and if anyone asks them why, they reply that the world is getting colder and colder.  They could also answer that they'd got older, but that would be too honest, you don't say that until you're forty and you can look back.  In your late twenties you go through your very private climate disaster and hope for better times." -- Zoran Drvenkar]]>

	    <![CDATA["The zombie looks like a man, walks like a man, eats and otherwise functions fully, yet is devoid of the spark. It represents the nagging doubt that lays deep in the heart of even the most zealous believer: &lt;i&gt;behind all of your pretty songs and stained glass, this is what you really are. Shambling meat.&lt;/i&gt; Our true fear of the zombie was never that its bite would turn us into one of them. Our fear is that we are already zombies." -- David Wong]]>
