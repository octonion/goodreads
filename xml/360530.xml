	    <![CDATA["[The doctor] peeked into the trauma room and saw the situation: the clerk - that is, me - standing next to the orderly, Georgie, both of us on drugs, looking down at a patient with a knife sticking up out of his face. 

'What seems to be the trouble?' he asked." -- Denis Johnson]]>

	    <![CDATA["They sat on a bench and Sproule held his wounded arm to his chest and rocked back and forth and blinked in the sun. 
What do you want to do? said the kid.
Get a drink of water.
Other than that.
I dont know.
You want to try and head back?
To Texas?
I don't know where else.
We'd never make it.
Well you say.
I aint got no say.
He was coughing again. He held his chest with his good hand and sat as if he'd get his breath. 
What have you got, a cold?
I got consumption.
Consumption?
He nodded. I come out here for my health." -- Cormac McCarthy]]>

	    <![CDATA["Check it out,' said Purdy, pointed across the room to a large canvas, a luminous twilit landscape. 'The latest Raskov.' 

A river coursed through a verdant gorge. The sky bled rich reds and blues. In the mossy foreground, a nude woman tongued the anus of an elk. Nearby, a figure in a shepherd's tunic lay disembowled. A fawn fed on his viscera.

It's called Renewable, Sustainable,' said Pury." -- San Lipsyte]]>

	    <![CDATA["Who exactly are we?' I asked.
The American Dreamers. There aren't too many of us left.' 
I don't know if I qualify.' 
You an American? Or want to be an American?'
I am an American.' 
You said you were having a dream.' 
It's true, I did.'
Was it the one where you're inside the girl and you are pumping her and pumping her and you are so happy but then it turns out it's not a girl, it's really one of those super poisonous box jellyfish, and it stings you and you are screaming and screaming and the sky rains the diarrhea of babies?'
The...no, I don't think so.' 
I get that sometimes. Anyway, see you around." -- Sam Lipsyte]]>
