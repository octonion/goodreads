	    <![CDATA["I wished for you,&quot; he whispered, so quietly that I struggled to hear.
&quot;What did that feel like? I've never made a wish in my life.&quot; My voice was as shaky as my words were stupid.
&quot;Everybody wishes for something, Charli.&quot;
I put just enough space between us to be able to look at him. &quot;Not me. I've saved them all up. Birthday candles, shooting stars, stray eyelashes...ladybugs. I've saved hem all up. I figure I'm owed hundreds of wishes now." -- GJ Walker-Smith]]>

	    <![CDATA["This boy was so far out of my league it was embarrassing. I found myself staring at him, trying to find some minute flaw that might justify dragging him back to my level. Finding nothing, I decided that having a dimple on only one cheek was practically a deformity." -- GJ Walker-Smith]]>
