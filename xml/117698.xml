		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The variations of the Duchess's judgment spared no one, except her
husband. He alone had never been in love with her, in him she had

displayed, contemptuous of her beauty, violent, of a will that would
never bend, the sort under which alone nervous people can find
tranquillity." -- Marcel Proust]]>
