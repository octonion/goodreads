	    <![CDATA["Once a little boy sent me a charming card with a little drawing on it. I loved it. I answer all my children’s letters — sometimes very hastily — but this one I lingered over. I sent him a card and I drew a picture of a Wild Thing on it. I wrote, “Dear Jim: I loved your card.” Then I got a letter back from his mother and she said, “Jim loved your card so much he ate it.” That to me was one of the highest compliments I’ve ever received. He didn’t care that it was an original Maurice Sendak drawing or anything. He saw it, he loved it, he ate it." -- Maurice Sendak]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["There are things than cannot ever occur with any precision.  They are too big and too magnificent to be contained in mere facts.  They are merely trying to occur, they are checking whether the ground of reality can carry them.  And they quickly withdraw, fearing to loose their integrity in the frailty of realization.  " -- Bruno Schulz]]>

	    <![CDATA["An event may be small and insignificant in its origin , and yet, when drawn close to one’s eye, it may open in its center an infinite and radiant perspective because a higher order of being is trying to express itself in it and irradiates it violently." -- Bruno Schulz]]>
