	    <![CDATA["You know what punk is? a bunch of no-talent guys who really, really want to be in a band.  Nobody reads music, nobody plays the mandolin, and you're too dumb to write songs about mythology or Middle-earth.  So what's your style?  Three chords, cranked out fast and loud and distorted because your instruments are crap and you can't play them worth a damn.  And you scream your lungs out to cover up the fact that you can't sing.  It should suck, but here's the thing - it doesn't.  Rock and roll can be so full of itself, but not this.  It's simple and angry and raw." -- Gordon Korman]]>
