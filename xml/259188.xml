	    <![CDATA["  I think of the chimp, the one with the talking hands.
  In the course of the experiment, that chimp had a baby.  Imagine how her trainers must have thrilled when the mother, without prompting, began to sign her newborn.
  Baby, drink milk.
  Baby, play ball.
  And when the baby died, the mother stood over the body, her wrinkled hands moving with animal grace, forming again and again the words:  Baby, come hug, Baby come hug, fluent now in the language of grief." -- Amy Hempel]]>

	    <![CDATA["A few light taps upon the pane made him turn to the window. It had begun to snow again. He watched sleepily the flakes, silver and dark, falling obliquely against the lamplight. The time had come for him to set out on his journey westward. Yes, the newspapers were right: snow was general all over Ireland. It was falling on every part of the dark central plain, on the treeless hills, falling softly upon the Bog of Allen and, farther westward, softly falling into the dark mutinous Shannon waves. It was falling, too, upon every part of the lonely churchyard on the hill where Michael Furey lay buried. It lay thickly drifted on the crooked crosses and headstones, on the spears of the little gate, on the barren thorns. His soul swooned slowly as he heard the snow falling faintly through the universe and faintly falling, like the descent of their last end, upon all the living and the dead." -- James Joyce]]>
