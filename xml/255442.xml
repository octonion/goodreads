	    <![CDATA["Don't think about what you've left behind&quot; The alchemist said to the boy as they began to ride across the sands of the desert. &quot;If what one finds is made of pure matter, it will never spoil. And one can always come back. If what you had found was only a moment of light, like the explosion of a star, you would find nothing on your return." -- Paulo Coelho]]>
