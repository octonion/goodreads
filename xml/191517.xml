	    <![CDATA["No one ever said that you would live to see the repercussions of everything you do, or that you have guarantees, or that you are not obliged to wander in the dark, or that everything will be proved to you and neatly verified like something in science. Nothing is: at least nothing that is worthwhile.  I didn't bring you up only to move across sure ground.  I didn't teach you to think that everything must be within our control or understanding.  Did I?  For, if I did, I was wrong.  I fyou won't take a chance, then the powers you refuse because you cannot explain them, will, as they say, make a monkey out of you." -- Mark Helprin]]>
