		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The Road Not Taken

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both	
And be one traveler, long I stood	
And looked down one as far as I could	
To where it bent in the undergrowth;	        
 
Then took the other, as just as fair,	
And having perhaps the better claim,	
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;	
Though as for that the passing there	
Had worn them really about the same,	        
 
And both that morning equally lay	
In leaves no step had trodden black.	
Oh, I kept the first for another day!	
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,	
I doubted if I should ever come back.	        
 
I shall be telling this with a sigh	
Somewhere ages and ages hence:	
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—	
I took the one less traveled by,	
And that has made all the difference." -- Robert Frost]]>

Down from the door where it began.

Until it joins some larger way
Where many paths and errands meet.
And whither then? I cannot say" -- J.R.R. Tolkien]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["O Deep Thought computer,&quot; he said, &quot;the task we have designed you to perform is this. We want you to tell us....&quot; he paused, &quot;The Answer.&quot;
&quot;The Answer?&quot; said Deep Thought. &quot;The Answer to what?&quot;
&quot;Life!&quot; urged Fook.
&quot;The Universe!&quot; said Lunkwill.
&quot;Everything!&quot; they said in chorus.
Deep Thought paused for a moment's reflection.
&quot;Tricky,&quot; he said finally.
&quot;But can you do it?&quot;
Again, a significant pause.
&quot;Yes,&quot; said Deep Thought, &quot;I can do it.&quot;
&quot;There is an answer?&quot; said Fook with breathless excitement.
&quot;Yes,&quot; said Deep Thought. &quot;Life, the Universe, and Everything. There is an answer. But, I'll have to think about it.&quot;
...
Fook glanced impatiently at his watch.
“How long?” he said.
“Seven and a half million years,” said Deep Thought.
Lunkwill and Fook blinked at each other.
“Seven and a half million years...!” they cried in chorus.
“Yes,” declaimed Deep Thought, “I said I’d have to think about it, didn’t I?&quot;

[Seven and a half million years later.... Fook and Lunkwill are long gone, but their ancestors continue what they started]

&quot;We are the ones who will hear,&quot; said Phouchg, &quot;the answer to the great question of Life....!&quot;
&quot;The Universe...!&quot; said Loonquawl.
&quot;And Everything...!&quot;
&quot;Shhh,&quot; said Loonquawl with a slight gesture. &quot;I think Deep Thought is preparing to speak!&quot;
There was a moment's expectant pause while panels slowly came to life on the front of the console. Lights flashed on and off experimentally and settled down into a businesslike pattern. A soft low hum came from the communication channel.

&quot;Good Morning,&quot; said Deep Thought at last.
&quot;Er..good morning, O Deep Thought&quot; said Loonquawl nervously, &quot;do you have...er, that is...&quot;
&quot;An Answer for you?&quot; interrupted Deep Thought majestically. &quot;Yes, I have.&quot;
The two men shivered with expectancy. Their waiting had not been in vain.
&quot;There really is one?&quot; breathed Phouchg.
&quot;There really is one,&quot; confirmed Deep Thought.
&quot;To Everything? To the great Question of Life, the Universe and everything?&quot;
&quot;Yes.&quot;
Both of the men had been trained for this moment, their lives had been a preparation for it, they had been selected at birth as those who would witness the answer, but even so they found themselves gasping and squirming like excited children.
&quot;And you're ready to give it to us?&quot; urged Loonsuawl.
&quot;I am.&quot;
&quot;Now?&quot;
&quot;Now,&quot; said Deep Thought.
They both licked their dry lips.
&quot;Though I don't think,&quot; added Deep Thought. &quot;that you're going to like it.&quot;
&quot;Doesn't matter!&quot; said Phouchg. &quot;We must know it! Now!&quot;
&quot;Now?&quot; inquired Deep Thought.
&quot;Yes! Now...&quot;
&quot;All right,&quot; said the computer, and settled into silence again. The two men fidgeted. The tension was unbearable.
&quot;You're really not going to like it,&quot; observed Deep Thought.
&quot;Tell us!&quot;
&quot;All right,&quot; said Deep Thought. &quot;The Answer to the Great Question...&quot;
&quot;Yes..!&quot;
&quot;Of Life, the Universe and Everything...&quot; said Deep Thought.
&quot;Yes...!&quot;
&quot;Is...&quot; said Deep Thought, and paused.
&quot;Yes...!&quot;
&quot;Is...&quot;
&quot;Yes...!!!...?&quot;
&quot;Forty-two,&quot; said Deep Thought, with infinite majesty and calm." -- Douglas Adams]]>
