	    <![CDATA["It's always the mother's fault, ain't it?&quot; she said softly, collecting her coat. &quot;That boy turn out bad cause his mama a drunk, or she a junkie.

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["This you must believe,&quot; she said, holding my gaze with an intent and profound expression, her eyes searching mine, &quot;this you must absolutely believe if you will ever believe anything I shall ever tell you. It is not the coming together or the parting of two people that counts, or where or when, but those two people themselves, and in what manner they are joined. And if it is not with hate but with love, not with impatience but with understanding, and never with boredome but with interest, then nothing can be wrong with their being together, no matter how wrong it may seem to others. But those others, they do not count, they must not be permitted to count, for it is only between the two persons themselves that it must have meaning. It is not so difficult for people to arrange their lives sensibly if they behave sensibly, but to arrange their lives happily, that is a far, far different thing." -- Thomas Tryon]]>
