		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I believe like a child that suffering will be healed and made up for, that all the humiliating absurdity of human contradictions will vanish like a pitiful mirage, like the despicable fabrication of the impotent and infinitely small Euclidean mind of man, that in the world's finale, at the moment of eternal harmony, something so precious will come to pass that it will suffice for all hearts, for the comforting of all resentments, for the atonement of all the crimes of humanity, for all the blood that they've shed; that it will make it not only possible to forgive but to justify all that has happened." -- Fyodor Dostoevsky]]>

	    <![CDATA["We begin to forgive by &lt;i&gt;choosing&lt;/i&gt; to forgive . . . by deciding, not by feeling. Our feelings don't lead us to forgive. Most times, our feelings lead us the other way. That's why a person has to decide to forgive first. Our feelings always follow along behind our decisions." -- Andy Andrews]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["That's why we get annoyed by you Idrians. So high, so certain that what you do is right. If your god asked you to give up your Breath—or even the Breath of your child—wouldn't you do it? You give up your children to become monks, forcing them into a life of servitude, don't you? That's seen as a sign of faith. Yet when we do something to serve our gods, you twist your lips at us and call us blasphemers." -- Brandon Sanderson]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["What I'm trying to say is that you don't understand a man until you understand what makes him do what he does. Every man is a hero in his own story, Princess. Murderers don't believe that they're to blame for what they do. Thieves, they think they deserve the money they take. Dictators, they believe they have the right—for the safety of their people and the good of the nation—to do whatever they wish. . . . The truth is, most people who do what you'd call &quot;wrong&quot; do it for what they call &quot;right&quot; reasons. Only mercenaries make any sense. We do what we're paid to do. That's it. Perhaps that's why people look down on us so. We're the only ones who don't pretend to have higher motives. . .  In a way, we're the most honest men you'll ever meet." -- Brandon Sanderson]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["They say a man doesn't know himself until he faces death for the first time. . . I don't know about that. It seems to me that the person you are when you're about to die isn't as important as the person you are during the rest of your life. Why should a few moments matter more than an entire lifetime?" -- Brandon Sanderson]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["She did believe in Austre. She loved the teachings of the five Visions. Humility. Sacrifice. Seeing another's problems before your own. Yet she was beginning to think that she—along with many others—had taken this belief too far, letting her desire to seem humble become a form of pride itself. She now saw that when her faith had become about clothing instead of people, it had taken a wrong turn." -- Brandon Sanderson]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["She'd been wrong about him. She was almost certain of that now. She had to stop judging people. But was that possible? Wasn't interaction based, in part, on judgments? A person's background and attitudes influenced how she responded to them.

The answer, then, wasn't to stop judging. It was to hold those judgements as mutable. She'd judged Denth to be a friend, but she shouldn't have ignored the way he talked about mercenaries having no friends." -- Brandon Sanderson]]>
