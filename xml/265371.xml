	    <![CDATA["No Belle, you're wrong.  No one will ever make me feel the way I do with you.  I know this with the certainty that the sun will set today and rise again tomorrow.  The kind of certainty that when the moon rises and the stars blink in the sky that they'll all still look way too dim to me.  They'll always look too dim because you are the brightest star in my life and, without you, everything else seems cloudy.  I only seem to see things clearly when you're around and I know all of that because you are my soul" -- Jessie Lane]]>

If I got a fatal disease, had one year to live, and devoted it to wiping out street crime. If I just dropped out and devoted my life to being bad." -- Neal Stephenson]]>

	    <![CDATA["The Everglades was the only place on earth where alligators (broad snout, fresh water, darker skin) and crocodiles (pointy snout, salt water, toothy grin) lived side by side. It was the only home of the Everglades mink, Okeechobee gourd, and Big Cypress fox squirrel. It had carnivorous plants, amphibious birds, oysters that grew on trees, cacti that grew in water, lizards that changed colors, and fish that changed genders. It had 1,100 species of trees and plants, 350 birds, and 52 varieties of porcelain-smooth, candy-striped tree snails. It had bottlenose dolphins, marsh rabbits, ghost orchids, moray eels, bald eagles, and countless other species that didn't seem to belong on the same continent, much less in the same ecosystem." -- Michael Grunwald]]>
