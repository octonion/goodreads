	    <![CDATA["For him that stealeth,or borroweth and returneth not,this book from its owner, let it change into a serpent in his hand and rend him. 
Let him be struck with palsy, and all his members blasted. 
Let him languish in pain, crying aloud for mercy, and let there be no surcease to this agony till he sing in dissolution. 
Let bookworms gnaw his entrails in token of the worm that dieth not, and when at last he goeth to his last punishment, let the flames of hell consume him for ever.

&lt;i&gt;Curse on book thieves&lt;/i&gt;, from the monastery of San Pedro, Barcelona, Spain" -- Cornelia Funke]]>

	    <![CDATA["With a heart of furious fancies
 Whereof I am commander,
With a burning spear and a horse of air,
 To the wilderness I wander.
With a knight of ghosts and shadows
 I summoned am to tourney,
Ten leagues beyond the wide world's end-
 Methinks it is no journey." -- Tom O'Bedlam]]>

	    <![CDATA["I read once that the ancient Egyptians had fifty words for sand &amp; the Eskimos had a hundred words for snow. I wish I had a thousand words for love, but all that comes to mind is the way you move against me while you sleep &amp; there are no words for that." -- Brian Andreas]]>
