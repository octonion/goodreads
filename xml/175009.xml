	    <![CDATA["I have a history of making decisions very quickly about men.  I have always fallen in love fast and without measuring risks.  I have a tendency not only to see the best in everyone, but to assume that everyone is emotionally capable of reaching his highest potential.  I have fallen in love more times than I care to count with the highest potential of a man, rather than with the man himself, and I have hung on to the relationship for a long time (sometimes far too long) waiting for the man to ascend to his own greatness.  Many times in romance I have been a victim of my own optimism." -- Elizabeth Gilbert]]>

	    <![CDATA["Watch out for intellect,
because it knows so much it knows nothing
and leaves you hanging upside down,
mouthing knowledge as your heart
falls out of your mouth." -- Anne Sexton]]>

	    <![CDATA["Maybe...you'll fall in love with me all over again.&quot;
&quot;Hell,&quot; I said, &quot;I love you enough now. What do you want to do? Ruin me?&quot;
&quot;Yes. I want to ruin you.&quot;
&quot;Good,&quot; I said. &quot;That's what I want too." -- Ernest Hemingway]]>

	    <![CDATA["If it wasnâ€™t for the mist we could see your home across the bay,&quot; said Gatsby. &quot;You always have a green light that burns at the end of your dock.&quot;
Daisy put her arm through his abruptly but he seemed absorbed in what he had just said. Possibly it had occurred to him that the colossal significance of that light had now vanished forever. Compared to the great distance that had separated him from Daisy it had seemed very near to him, almost touching her. It had seemed as close as a star to the moon. Now it was again a green light on a dock. His count of enchanted things had diminished by one." -- F. Scott Fitzgerald]]>
