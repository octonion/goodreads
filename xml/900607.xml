	    <![CDATA["Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres." -- Anonymous]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Love is a wonderful gift. It's a present so precious words can barely begin to describe it.  Love is a feeling, the deepest and sweetest of all.  It's incredibly strong and amazingly gentle at the very same time.  It is a blessing that should be counted every day.  It is nourishment for the soul.  It is devotion, constantly letting each person know how supportive it's certainty can be. Love is a heart filled with affection for the most important person in your life. Love is looking at the special someone who makes your world go around and absolutely loving what you see. Love gives meaning to one's world and magic to a million hopes and dreams.  It makes the morning shine more brightly and each season seem like it's the nicest one anyone ever had. Love is an invaluable bond that enriches every good thing in life.  It gives each hug a tenderness, each heart a happiness, each spirit a steady lift.  Love is an invisible connection that is exquisitely felt by those who know the joy, feel the warmth, share the sweetness, and celebrate the gift! " -- Douglas Pagels]]>
