		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["One of the biggest, and possibly the biggest, obstacle to becoming a writer... is learning to live with the fact that the wonderful story in your head is infinitely better, truer, more moving, more fascinating, more perceptive, than anything you're going to manage to get down on paper. (And if you ever think otherwise, then you've turned into an arrogant self-satisfied prat, and should look for another job or another avocation or another weekend activity.) So you have to learn to live with the fact that you're never going to write well enough. Of course that's what keeps you trying -- trying as hard as you can -- which is a good thing." -- Robin McKinley]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["When you write your first novel you don't really know what you're doing.  There may be writers out there who are brilliant, incisive and in control from their first 'Once upon a time'.  I'm not one of them.  Every once upon a time for me is another experience of white-water rafting in a leaky inner tube.  And I have this theory that while the Story Council has its faults, it does have some idea that if books are going to get written, authors have to be able to write them." -- Robin McKinley]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Whenever women have insisted on absolute equality with men, they have invariably wound up with the dirty end of the stick. What they are and what they can do makes them superior to men, and their proper tactic is to demand special privileges, all the traffic will bear. They should never settle merely for equality. For women, &quot;equality&quot; is a disaster." -- Robert A. Heinlein]]>
