		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I don't accept the currently fashionable assertion that any view is automatically as worthy of respect as any equal and opposite view. My view is that the moon is made of rock. If someone says to me 'Well, you haven't been there, have you? You haven't seen it for yourself, so my view that it is made of Norwegian Beaver Cheese is equally valid' - then I can't even be bothered to argue. There is such a thing as the burden of proof, and in the case of god, as in the case of the composition of the moon, this has shifted radically. God used to be the best explanation we'd got, and we've now got vastly better ones. God is no longer an explanation of anything, but has instead become something that would itself need an insurmountable amount of explaining. So I don't think that being convinced that there is no god is as irrational or arrogant a point of view as belief that there is. I don't think the matter calls for even-handedness at all." -- Douglas Adams]]>

It's like having a small piece of defrosting liver pressed lovingly against you." -- Terry Pratchett]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The &lt;i&gt;place&lt;/i&gt; where the story happened was a world on the back of four elephants perched on the shell of a giant turtle.  That's the advantage of space. It's big enough to hold practically &lt;i&gt;anything&lt;/i&gt;, and so, eventually, it does.
People think that it is strange to have a turtle ten thousand miles long and an elephant more than two thousand miles tall, which just shows that the human brain is ill-adapted for thinking and was probably originally designed for cooling the blood. It believes mere size is &lt;i&gt;amazing&lt;/i&gt;.
There's nothing amazing about size. Turtles are amazing, and elephants are quite astonishing. But the fact that there's a big turtle is far less amazing than the fact that there is a turtle &lt;i&gt;anywhere&lt;/i&gt;." -- Terry Pratchett]]>

Which they won't do if they don't know about it. This explains why it is so important to shoot missionaries on sight." -- Terry Pratchett]]>
