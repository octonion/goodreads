	    <![CDATA["Growing up is a trap,&quot; snapped Dr. Robbins. &quot;When they tell you to shut up, they mean stop talking. When they tell you to grow up, they mean stop growing. Reach a nice level plateau and settle there, predictable and unchanging, no longer a threat." -- Tom Robbins]]>

	    <![CDATA["Sissy: You really don't believe in political solutions do you?

The Chink: I believe in political solutions to political problems. But man's primary problems aren't political; they're philosophical. Until humans can solve their philosophical problems, they're condemned to solve their political problems over and over and over again. It's a cruel, repetitious bore.

Sissy: Well, then, what are the philosophical solutions?

The Chink: Ha ha ho ho and hee hee. That's for you to find out. I'll say this much and no more: there's got to be poetry. And magic. At every level. If civilization is ever going to be anything but a grandiose pratfall, anything more than a can of deodorizer in the shithouse of existence, then statesmen are going to have to concern themselves with magic and poetry. Bankers are going to have to concern themselves with magic and poetry. Time magazine is going to have to write about magic and poetry. Factory workers and housewives are going to have to get their lives entangled in magic and poetry.

Sissy: Do you think such a thing can ever happen?

The Chink: If you understood poetry and magic, you'd know that it doesn't matter." -- Tom Robbins]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["As long as a population can be induced to believe in a supernatural hereafter, it can be oppressed and controlled.  People will put up with all sorts of tyranny, poverty, and painful treatment if they're convinced that they'll eventually escape to some resort in the sky where lifeguards are superfluous and the pool never closes.  Moreover, the faithful are usually willing to risk their skins in whatever military adventure their government may currently be promoting." -- Tom Robbins]]>
