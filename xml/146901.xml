		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Its funny how certain objects convey a message -- my washer and dryer, for example. They can't speak, of course, but whenever I pass them they remind me that I'm doing fairly well. &quot;No more laundromat for you,&quot; they hum. My stove, a downer, tells me every day that I can't cook, and before I can defend myself my scale jumps in, shouting from the bathroom, &quot;Well, he must be doing something. My numbers are off the charts.&quot; The skeleton has a much more limited vocabulary and says only one thing: &quot;You are going to die." -- David Sedaris]]>

	    <![CDATA["When all the media assertions were put together, the police appeared to be hunting for a psychotic lesbian who had joined a cult of Satanists that propagandized for S&amp;M sex and hated society in general and men in particular. Because Salander had been abroad for the past year, there might be international connections too." -- Stieg Larsson]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The days will rally, wreathing
Their crazy tarantelle;
And you must go on breathing,
But I'll be safe in hell.

Like January weather,
The years will bite and smart,
And pull your bones together
To wrap your chattering heart.

The pretty stuff you're made of
Will crack and crease and dry.
The thing you are afraid of
Will look from every eye.

You will go faltering after
The bright, imperious line,
And split your throat on laughter,
And burn your eyes with brine.

You will be frail and musty
With peering, furtive head,
Whilst I am young and lusty
Among the roaring dead." -- Dorothy Parker]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["When we honestly ask ourselves which person in our lives mean the most to us, we often find that it is those who, instead of giving advice, solutions, or cures, have chosen rather to share our pain and touch our wounds with a warm and tender hand. The friend who can be silent with us in a moment of despair or confusion, who can stay with us in an hour of grief and bereavement, who can tolerate not knowing, not curing, not healing and face with us the reality of our powerlessness, that is a friend who cares." -- Henri Nouwen]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I measure every Grief I meet
With narrow, probing, Eyes;
I wonder if It weighs like Mine,
Or has an Easier size. 
  
I wonder if They bore it long,
Or did it just begin?
I could not tell the Date of Mine, 
It feels so old a pain. 
  
I wonder if it hurts to live,
And if They have to try,
And whether, could They choose between, 
It would not be,  to die. 
  
I note that Some -- 
gone patient long --
At length, renew their smile.
An imitation of a Light
That has so little Oil. 
  
I wonder if when Years have piled,
Some Thousands -- on the Harm 
Of early hurt -- if such a lapse
Could give them any Balm; 
  
Or would they go on aching still
Through Centuries above,
Enlightened to a larger Pain
By Contrast with the Love. 
  
The Grieved are many, 
I am told;
The reason deeper lies, --
Death is but one
and comes but once,
And only nails the eyes. 
  
There's Grief of Want 
and Grief of Cold, --
A sort they call &quot;Despair&quot;;
There's Banishment from native Eyes,
In sight of Native Air. 
  
And though I may not guess the kind
Correctly, yet to me
A piercing Comfort it affords
In passing Calvary, 
  
To note the fashions of the Cross,
And how they're mostly worn,
Still fascinated to presume
That Some are like My Own." -- Emily Dickinson]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["All these young mothers chauffeuring their volcanic three-year-olds through the grocery store. The child's name always sounds vaguely presidental, and he or she tends to act accordingly. &quot;Mommy hears what you're saying about treats,&quot; the woman will say, &quot;But right now she needs you to let go of her hair and put the chocolate-covered Life Savers back where they came from.&quot;

&quot;No!&quot; screams McKinley or Madison, Kennedy or Lincoln or beet-faced baby Reagan. Looking on, I always want to intervene. &quot;Listen,&quot; I'd like to say, &quot;I'm not a parent myself, but I think the best solution at this point is to slap that child across the face. It won't stop its crying, but at least now it'll be doing it for a good reason." -- David Sedaris]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["When I look back on my childhood I wonder how I survived at all. It was, of course, a miserable childhood: the happy childhood is hardly worth your while. Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood.
. . . nothing can compare with the Irish version: the poverty; the shiftless loquacious alcoholic father; the pious defeated mother moaning by the fire; pompous priests; bullying schoolmasters; the English and the terrible things they did to us for eight hundred long years." -- Frank McCourt]]>
