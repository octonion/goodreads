		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["It is true that I can trip over anything and nothing – a speck of dust, a patch of sunlight, an idea. I move through life like a person with one eye, through a landscape that looks flat, but is really tricked out with hidden depths and shallows. It didn’t use to be so, but no matter. I navigate the world well enough in my own way." -- Franny Billingsley]]>

He loved the humanity that could not understand or fully accept him; I, in the midst of the same human race, became a thinking machine." -- Laurie R. King]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I read &lt;i&gt;old&lt;/i&gt; novels.  The reason is simple: I prefer proper endings.  Marriages and deaths, noble sacrifices and miraculous restorations, tragic separations and unhoped-for reunions, great falls and dreams fulfilled; these, in my view, constitute an ending worth the wait.  They should come after adventures, perils, dangers and dilemmas, and wind everything up nice and neatly.  Endings like this are to be found more commonly in old novels than new ones, so I read old novels." -- Diane Setterfield]]>

	    <![CDATA["Our lives are so important to us that we tend to think the story of them begins with our birth.  First there was nothing, then I was born...Yet that is not so.  Human lives are not pieces of string that can be separated out from a knot of others and laid out straight.  Families are webs.  Impossible to touch one part of it without setting the rest vibrating.  Impossible to understand one part without having a sense of the whole. - Vida Winter" -- Diane Setterfield]]>

That that’s how we humans find our way to immortality. This is not a new thought; I’ve had such thoughts before. But I have a new thought now. 

That that’s how we find our way toward meaning. 

Meaning. If you’re going to die, you want to find meaning in life. 

You want to connect the dots." -- Franny Billingsley]]>
