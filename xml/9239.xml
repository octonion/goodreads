	    <![CDATA["Unlike me, Renee was not shy; she was a real people-pleaser. She worried way too much what people thought of her, wore her heart on her sleeve, expected too much from people, and got hurt too easily. She kept other people's secrets like a champ, but told her own too fast. She expected the world not to cheat her and was always surprised when it did." -- Rob Sheffield]]>

	    <![CDATA["Destiny is usually just around the corner.  Like a thief, a hooker, or a lottery vendor: its three most common personifications.  But what destiny does not do is home visits.  You have to go for it." -- Carlos Ruiz Zafón]]>

	    <![CDATA["We do not believe in ourselves until someone reveals that deep inside us something is valuable, worth listening to, worthy of our trust, sacred to our touch. Once we believe in ourselves we can risk curiosity, wonder, spontaneous delight or any experience that reveals the human spirit." -- E.E. Cummings]]>
