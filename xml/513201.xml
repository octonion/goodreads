	    <![CDATA["If you wanted to create an education environment that was directly opposed to what the brain was good at doing, you probably would design something like a classroom. If you wanted to create a business environment that was directly opposed to what the brain was good at doing, you probably would design something like a cubicle. And if you wanted to change things, you might have to tear down both and start over." -- John Medina]]>

	    <![CDATA["We do children an enormous disservice when we assume that they cannot appreciate anything beyond drive through fare and nutritionally marginal, kid-targeted convenience foods.  Our children are capable of consuming something that grew in a garden or on a tree and never saw a deep fryer.  They are capable of making it through diner at a sit-down restaurant with tablecloths and no climbing equipment.  Children deserve quality nourishment." -- Victoria Moran]]>
