	    <![CDATA["Non...I am DANCING IN MY NUDDY-PANTS!!!'
And we both laughed like loons on loon tablets. I danced for ages round the house in my nuddy-pants. Also, I did this brilliant thing-I danced in the front window just for a second whilst Mr. Across the Road was drawing his curtains. He will never be sure if he saw a mirage or not. That is the kind of person I am. Not really the kind of person who goes and raises elks in Whakatane." -- Louise Rennison]]>

	    <![CDATA["Buy or borrow self-improvement books, but don't read them.  Stack them around your bedroom and use them as places to rest bowls of cookies.

Watch exercise shows on television, but don't do the exercises.  Practice believing that the benefit lies in imagining yourself doing the exercises.

Don't power walk.  Saunter slowly in the sun, eating chocolate, and carry a blanket so you can take a nap." -- SARK]]>
