	    <![CDATA["Its been six weeks,&quot; he murmured.  &quot;Six weeks I've wanted you.  I know how you move, and how the sunlight makes a shadow on the curve of your cheek, and the shape of your ear.&quot;  He chucked harshly then turned his head on the pillow to look at her.  &quot;I'm dying,&quot; he said.  He dropped his fist against his chest.  &quot;Right here, you're killing me." -- Laura Kinsale]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Colpo di fulmine. The thunderbolt, as Italians call it. When love strikes someone like lightning, so powerful and intense it can’t be denied. It’s beautiful and messy,
cracking a chest open and spilling their soul out for the world to see. It turns a person inside out, and there’s no going back from it. Once the thunderbolt hits, your life is
irrevocably changed." -- J.M. Darhower]]>

	    <![CDATA["Over time, the ghosts of things that happened start to turn distant; once they've cut you a couple of million times, their edges blunt on your scar tissue, they wear thin.  The ones that slice like razors forever are the ghosts of things that never got the chance to happen." -- Tana French]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["When she closed her eyes she felt he had many hands, which touched her everywhere, and many mouths, which passed so swiftly over her, and with a wolflike sharpness, his teeth sank into her fleshiest parts. Naked now, he lay his full length over her. She enjoyed his weight on her, enjoyed being crushed under his body. She wanted him soldered to her, from mouth to feet. Shivers passed through her body." -- Anaïs Nin]]>
