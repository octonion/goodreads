		<description>
	    <![CDATA["In the beginning, I want to say something about human greatness. Some time ago, I was reading texts of Kungtse. When I read these texts, I understood something about human greatness. What I understood from his writings was: What is greatest in human beings is what makes them equal to everybody else. Everything else that deviates higher or lower from what is common to all human beings makes us less. If we know this, we can develop a deep respect for every human being." -- Bert Hellinger]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["But feel what happens in the soul when you imagine children saying to their parents, &quot;What you gave me, first of all, wasn't the right thing, and secondly, it wasn't enough. You still owe me.&quot; What do children have from their parents when they feel that way? Nothing. And what do the parents have from their children? Also nothing. Such children cannot separate from their parents. Their accusations and demands tie them to their parents so that, although they are bound to their parents, the children have no parents. They then feel empty, needy and weak.

This is the second Order of Love, that children take what their parents give in addition to life as it comes." -- Bert Hellinger]]>

	    <![CDATA["It is ironical that, in the very field in which Science has claimed superiority to Theology, for example - in the abandoning of dogma and the granting of absolute freedom to criticism - the positions are now reversed.
Science will not tolerate criticism of special relativity, while Theology talks freely about the death of God, religionless Christianity, and so on." -- Herbert Dingle]]>
