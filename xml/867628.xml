	    <![CDATA["Lesson learned? When people say, &quot;You really, really must&quot; do something, it means you don't really have to. No one ever says, &quot;You really, really must deliver the baby during labor.&quot; When it's true, it doesn't need to be said." -- Tina Fey]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["So, my unsolicited advice to women in the workplace is this. When faced with sexism, or ageism, or lookism, or even really aggressive Buddhism, ask yourself the following question: “Is this person in between me and what I want to do?” If the answer is no, ignore it and move on. Your energy is better used doing your work and outpacing people that way. Then, when you’re in charge, don’t hire the people who were jerky to you." -- Tina Fey]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Politics and prostitution have to be the only jobs where inexperience is considered a virtue. In what other profession would you brag about not knowing stuff? “I’m not one of those fancy Harvard heart surgeons. I’m just an unlicensed plumber with a dream and I’d like to cut your chest open.” The crowd cheers." -- Tina Fey]]>

	    <![CDATA["This is what I tell young women who ask me for career advice. People are going to try to trick you. To make you feel that you are in competition with one another. &quot;You're up for a promotion. If they go for a woman, it'll be between you and Barbara.&quot; Don't be fooled. You're not in competition with other women. You're in competition with &lt;i&gt;everyone&lt;/i&gt;." -- Tina Fey]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I only hope that one day I can frighten my daughter this much. Right now, she's not scared of my husband or me at all. I think it's a problem. I was a freshman home from college the first time my dad said, &quot;You're going  out at ten p.m.? I don't think so,&quot; and I just laughed and said, &quot;It's fine.&quot; I feel like my daughter will be doing that to me by age six.

How can I give her what Don Fey gave me? The gift of anxiety. The fear of getting in trouble. The knowledge that while you are loved, you are not above the law. The Worldwide Parental Anxiety System is failing if this many of us have made sex tapes." -- Tina Fey]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["there was an assumption that I was personally attacking Sarah Palin by impersonating her on TV. No one ever said it was 'mean' when Chevy Chase played Gerald Ford falling down all the time. No one ever accused Dana Carvey or Darrell Hammond or Dan Aykroyd of 'going too far' in their political impressions. You see what I'm getting at here. I am not mean and Mrs. Palin is not fragile. To imply otherwise is a disservice to us both." -- Tina Fey]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I believed that books might save him because I knew they had so far, and because I knew the people books had saved.  They were college professors and actors and scientists and poets.  They got to college and sat on dorm floors drinking coffee, amazed they'd finally found their soul mates.  They always dressed a little out of season.  Their names were enshrined on the pink cards in the pockets of all the forgotten hardbacks in every library basement in America.  If the librarians were lazy enough or nostalgic enough or smart enough, those names would stay there forever." -- Rebecca Makkai]]>

	    <![CDATA["I'd forgotten that all runaway stories end like this. Everyone goes home. Dorothy clicks her way back to Kansas, Ulysses sails his way home to his wife, Holden Caulfield breaks into his own apartment ... Here I was, just like Ian, just like Dorothy and everyone else, heading back home at last ... You think you can't go home again? It's the only place you can *ever* go." -- Rebecca Makkai]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I cannot understand why you should wish to leave this beautiful country and go back to the dry, gray place you call Kansas.&quot;
&quot;That is because you have no brains,&quot; answered the girl.  &quot;No matter how dreary and gray our homes are, we people of flesh and blood would rather live there than in any other country, be it ever so beautiful.  There is no place like home.&quot; 
The Scarecrow sighed.
&quot;Of course I cannot understand it,&quot; he said.  &quot;If your heads were stuffed with straw, like mine, you would probably all live in beautiful places, and then Kansas would have no people at all.  It is fortunate for Kansas that you have brains." -- L. Frank Baum]]>

	    <![CDATA["I couldn’t forgive him or like him, but I saw that what he had done was, to him, entirely justified. It was all very careless and confused. They were careless people, Tom and Daisy—they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made." -- F.

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["There must have been moments even that afternoon when Daisy tumbled short of his dreams -- not through her own fault, but because of the colossal vitality of his illusion. It had gone beyond her, beyond everything. He had thrown himself into it with a creative passion, adding to it all the time, decking it out with every bright feather that drifted his way. No amount of fire or freshness can challenge what a man will store up in his ghostly heart." -- F. Scott Fitzgerald]]>
