	    <![CDATA["The poet [author:Diagoras of Melos|8076174] was perhaps the most famous atheist of the fifth century. Although he did not write about atheism, anecdotes about his unbelief suggest he was self-confident, almost teasing, and very public. He revealed the secret rituals of the Eleusinian mystery religion to everyone and '&lt;i&gt;thus made them ordinary&lt;/i&gt;,' that is, he purposefully demystified a cherished secret rite, apparently to provoke his contemporaries into thought. In another famous story, a friend pointed out an expensive display of votive gifts and said, '&lt;i&gt;You think the gods have no care for man? Why, you can see from all these votive pictures here how many people have escaped the fury of storms at sea by praying to the gods who have brought them safe to harbor&lt;/i&gt;.' To which [author:Diagoras|8076174] replied, '&lt;i&gt;Yes, indeed, but where are the pictures of all those who suffered shipwreck and perished in the waves&lt;/i&gt;?' A good question. [author:Diagoras|8076174] was indicted for profaning the mysteries, but escaped. A search was out for him throughout the Athenian empire, which indicated that the charges were serious, but he was not found." -- Jennifer Michael Hecht]]>

	    <![CDATA["When They Die We Change Our Minds About Them 

When they die we change our minds about them. While they live we see the plenty hard they’re trying,to be a star, or nice, or wise, and so we do not quite believe them. When they die, suddenly they are what they claimed. Turns out, that’s what one of those looks like. The cold war over manner of manly or mission is over. Same person, same facts and acts, just now a quiet brain stem. We no longer begrudge his or her stupid luck.When they die we change our minds about them. I will try to believe while you yet breathe." -- Jennifer Michael Hecht]]>
