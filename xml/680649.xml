	    <![CDATA["And the barman asked me if I was alright? Simple little question.  And i said I was.  And he said he'd make me a sandwich.  And I said okay.  And I nearly started crying--because you know, here was someone just...And I watched him.  He took two big slices off a fresh loaf and buttered them carefully, spreading it all around.  I'll never forget it.  And then he sliced some cheese and cooked ham and an onion out of a jar, and put it all on a plate and sliced it down the middle.  And, just someone doing this for me.  And putting it down in front of me.  'Get that down you, now,' he said.  And then he folded up his newspaper and put on his jacket, and went off on his break.  And there was another barman then.  And I took this sandwich up and I could hardly swallow it, because of the lump in my throat.  But I ate i tall down because someone I didn't know had done this for me.  Such a small thing.  But a huge thing.  In my condition." -- Conor McPherson]]>
