		<description>
	    <![CDATA["There must have been moments even that afternoon when Daisy tumbled short of his dreams -- not through her own fault, but because of the colossal vitality of his illusion. It had gone beyond her, beyond everything. He had thrown himself into it with a creative passion, adding to it all the time, decking it out with every bright feather that drifted his way. No amount of fire or freshness can challenge what a man will store up in his ghostly heart." -- F. Scott Fitzgerald]]>

	    <![CDATA["Ah,&quot; she cried, &quot;you look so cool.&quot; 

Their eyes met, and they stared together at each other, alone in space. With an effort she glanced down at the table.

You always look so cool,&quot; she repeated.

She had told him that she loved him, and Tom Buchanan saw." -- F. Scott Fitzgerald]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["At some point during almost every romantic comedy, the female lead suddenly trips and falls, stumbling helplessly over something ridiculous like a leaf, and then some Matthew McConaughey type either whips around the corner just in the nick of time to save her or is clumsily pulled down along with her. That event predictably leads to the magical moment of their first kiss. Please. I fall ALL the time. You know who comes and gets me? The bouncer." -- Chelsea Handler]]>

I may even start my own group fashioned after MADD, Mothers Against Drunk Driving, but I'll call it AWLTDASH, Alcoholics Who Like to Drink and Stay Home." -- Chelsea Handler]]>
