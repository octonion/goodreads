		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Most problems of teaching are not problems of growth but helping cultivate growth.  As far as I know, and this is only from personal experience in teaching, I think about ninety percent of the problem in teaching, or maybe ninety-eight percent, is just to help the students get interested.  Or what it usually amounts to is to not prevent them from being interested.  Typically they come in interested, and the process of education is a way of driving that defect out of their minds.  But if children['s] ... normal interest is maintained or even aroused, they can do all kinds of things in ways we don't understand." -- Noam Chomsky]]>
