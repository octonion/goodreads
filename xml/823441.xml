		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Of course, everyone's parents are embarrassing. It goes with the territory. The nature of parents is to embarrass merely by existing, just as it is the nature of children of a certain age to cringe with embarrassment, shame, and mortification should their parents so much as speak to them on the street. " -- Neil Gaiman]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Nothing ever begins. 
There is no first moment; no single word or place from which this or any story springs. 
The threads can always be traced back to some earlier tale, and the tales that preceded that; though as the narrator's voice recedes the connections will seem to grow more tenuous, for each age will want the tale told as if it were of its own making." -- Clive Barker]]>
