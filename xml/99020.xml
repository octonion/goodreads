		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The fact is that everything I have in my pockets is carefully chosen so I’ll always be prepared. Everything is there so I can be at an advantage at the moment of truth. Actually, that’s not accurate. Everything’s there so I won’t be at a disadvantage at the moment of truth." -- Etgar Keret]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I've often been accused of harnessing genre strategies to mainstream ends. I do concede that relationships, characters, and introspection are my primary interest. The fanciful is of a secondary order of importance; I usually use it to approach the large issue of perception, so that my fantastical elements, while intended as real within the stories, occupy some borderland between reality and psychology." -- Karen Joy Fowler]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I always had plenty of ideas. I didn’t exactly have them. They grew—little by little, a half an idea at a time. First, part of a phrase and then a person to go with it. After a person, then a little corner of a place for the person to be in." -- Carol Emshwiller]]>

But because I thought this life was in addition to and not instead of, I devoured it without a second's hesitation." -- Etgar Keret]]>

	    <![CDATA["I love sleep because it is both pleasant and safe to use. Pleasant because one is in the best possible company and safe because sleep is the consummate protection against the unseemliness that is the invariable consequence of being awake. What you don't know won't hurt you. Sleep is death without the responsibility." -- Fran Lebowitz]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Her visits to her former hometown were infrequent and often painful.  Pilgrimages fueled by the tepid oxygen of family duty, unease, guilt.  The more Esther loved her parents, the more helpless she felt, as they aged, to protect them from harm.  A moral coward, she kept her distance." -- Joyce Carol Oates]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["It's amazing how people can sound like retards when they're talking to their girlfriend, especially if they really love her a lot.  Because when you're just fucking someone you make a point of keeping your cool, but when you're really in love - it can sound pretty repulsive." -- Etgar Keret]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I thought of myself, in those days, as someone in disguise—beneath the obedient son, beneath the straight-A student, the agreeable well-brought-up boy with his friends and his ping-pong and his semiofficial girlfriend, there was another being, restless, elusive, mocking, disruptive, imperious, and this shadowy underself had nothing to do with that other one who laughed with his friends and went to school dances and spent summer afternoons at the beach." -- Steven Millhauser]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["He misses the feeling of creating something out of something. That’s right — something out of something. Because something out of nothing is when you make something up out of thin air, in which case it has no value. Anybody can do that. But something out of something means it was really there the whole time, inside you, and you discover it as part of something new, that’s never happened before." -- Etgar Keret]]>
