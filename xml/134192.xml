	    <![CDATA["I can never read all the books I want; I can never be all the people I want and live all the lives I want. I can never train myself in all the skills I want. And why do I want? I want to live and feel all the shades, tones and variations of mental and physical experience possible in life. And I am horribly limited." -- Sylvia Plath]]>

Don't power walk.  Saunter slowly in the sun, eating chocolate, and carry a blanket so you can take a nap." -- SARK]]>

	    <![CDATA["Women intrinsically understand human dynamics, and that makes them unstoppable.  Unfortunately, the average man is less adroit at fostering such rivalries, which is why most men remain average; males are better at hating things that can't hate them back (e.g., lawnmowers, cats, the Denver Broncos, et cetera).  They don't see the big picture." -- Chuck Klosterman]]>
