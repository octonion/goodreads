But conversely, the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man&amp;mdash;for precisely the same reasons." -- Douglas Adams]]>

	    <![CDATA["You are your mother's trueborn son of Lannister.&quot;

&quot;Am I?&quot; the dwarf replied, sardonic. &quot;Do tell my lord father. My mother died birthing me, and he's never been sure.&quot;

&quot;I don't even know who my mother was,&quot; Jon said. 

&quot;Some woman, no doubt. Most of them are.&quot; He favored Jon with a rueful grin. &quot;Remember this, boy. All dwarfs may be bastards, yet not all bastards need be dwarfs.&quot;

And with that he turned and sauntered back into the feast, whistling a tune. 

When he opened the door, the light from within threw his shadow clear across the yard, and for just a moment Tyrion Lannister stood tall as a king." -- George R.R. Martin]]>

No amount of fire or freshness can challenge what a man will store up in his ghostly heart." -- F. Scott Fitzgerald]]>

	    <![CDATA["Because music, like color, or a cloud, is neither intelligent nor unintelligent - it just is. The chord, the simplest building block for even the tritest, silliest chart song, is a beautiful, perfect, mysterious thing, and when an ill-read, uneducated, uncultured, emotionally illiterate boor puts a couple of them together, he has every chance of creating something wonderful and powerful. All I ask of music is that is sounds good." -- Nick Hornby]]>
