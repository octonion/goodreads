	    <![CDATA["When a reader falls in love with a book, it leaves its essence inside him, like radioactive fallout in an arable field, and after that there are certain crops that will no longer grow in him, while other, stranger, more fantastic growths may occasionally be produced.&quot;

[&lt;i&gt;Books vs. Goons&lt;/i&gt;, L.A. Times, April 24, 2005]" -- Salman Rushdie]]>

	    <![CDATA["I've come up with a set of rules that describe our reactions to technologies:
1. Anything that is in the world when you’re born is normal and ordinary and is just a natural part of the way the world works.
2. Anything that's invented between when you’re fifteen and thirty-five is new and exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it.
3. Anything invented after you're thirty-five is against the natural order of things." -- Douglas Adams]]>
