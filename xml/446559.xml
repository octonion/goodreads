	    <![CDATA["One thing he discovered with a great deal of astonishment was that music held for him more then just pleasure.  There was meat to it.  The grouping of sounds, their forms in the air as they rang out and faded, said something comforting to him about the rule of Creation.  What the music said was that there is a right way for things to be ordered so that life might not always be just tangle and drift, but have a shape, an aim.  It was a powerful argument that life did not just happen." -- Charles Frazier]]>
