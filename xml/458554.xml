	    <![CDATA["Come live with me and be my love,
And we will all the pleasures prove
That valleys, groves, hills, and fields,
Woods or steepy mountain yields.

And we will sit upon the rocks,
Seeing the shepherds feed their flocks,
By shallow rivers to whose falls
Melodious birds sing madrigals.

And I will make thee beds of roses
And a thousand fragrant posies,
A cap of flowers, and a kirtle
Embroidered all with leaves of myrtle;

A gown made of the finest wool
Which from our pretty lambs we pull;
Fair lined slippers for the cold,
With buckles of th purest gold;

A belt of straw and ivy buds,
With coral clasps and amber studs:
And if these pleasures may thee move,
Come live with me and be my love.

The shepherds' swains shall dance and sing
For thy delight each May morning:
If these delights thy mind may move,
Then live with me and be my love." -- Christoper Marlowe]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["We rely upon the poets, the philosophers, and the playwrights to articulate what most of us can only feel, in joy or sorrow.  They illuminate the thoughts for which we only grope; they give us the strength and balm we cannot find in ourselves.  Whenever I feel my courage wavering, I rush to them.  They give me the wisdom of acceptance, the will and resiliance to push on." -- Helen Hayes]]>
