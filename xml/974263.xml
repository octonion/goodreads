	    <![CDATA["From the bottom of my heart, I wanted to give up; I wanted to give up on living.  There was no denying that tomorrow would come, and the day after tomorrow, and so next week, too.  I never thought it would be this hard, but I would go on living in the midst of a glomy depression, and that made me feel sick to the depths of my soul.  In spite of the tempest raging within me, I walked the night path calmly." -- Banana Yoshimoto]]>

	    <![CDATA["Love is the kind of thing that's already happening by the time you notice it, that's how it works, and no matter how old you get, that doesn't change.  Except that you can break it up into two entirely distinct types -- love where there's an end in sight and love where there isn't." -- Banana Yoshimoto]]>
