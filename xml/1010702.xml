	    <![CDATA["Very few people really care about freedom, about liberty, about the truth, very few. Very few people have guts, the kind of guts on which a real democracy has to depend. Without people with that sort of guts a free society dies or cannot be born." -- Doris Lessing]]>

	    <![CDATA["Many forms of Government have been tried, and will be tried in this world of sin and woe. No one pretends that democracy is perfect or all-wise. Indeed, it has been said that democracy is the worst form of Government except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.&quot;

(Speech in the House of Commons, 11 November 1947)" -- Winston S. Churchill]]>
