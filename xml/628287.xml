		<description>
	    <![CDATA["If you cannot understand that there is something in man which responds to the challenge of this mountain and goes out to meet it, that the struggle is the struggle of life itself upward and forever upward, then you won't see why we go. What we get from this adventure is just sheer joy. And joy is, after all, the end of life. We do not live to eat and make money. We eat and make money to be able to enjoy life. That is what life means and what life is for. 
" -- George H. Leigh-Mallory ]]>

	    <![CDATA["I am looking for friends. What does that mean -- tame?&quot;

&quot;It is an act too often neglected,&quot; said the fox. &quot;It means to establish ties.&quot; 

&quot;To establish ties?&quot; 

&quot;Just that,&quot; said the fox. &quot;To me, you are still nothing more than a little boy who is just like a hundred thousand other little boys. And I have no need of you. And you, on your part, have no need of me. To you I am nothing more than a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes. But if you tame me, then we shall need each other. To me, you will be unique in all the world. To you, I shall be unique in all the world...." -- Antoine de Saint-Exupéry]]>

If the new choice is also unpalatable, without embarrassment, we must be ready to change that as well." -- Maya Angelou]]>
