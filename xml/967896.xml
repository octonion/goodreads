	    <![CDATA["Don't think. Thinking is the enemy of creativity. It's self-conscious and anything self-conscious is lousy. You can't &quot;try&quot; to do things. You simply &quot;must&quot; do things." -- Ray Bradbury]]>

	    <![CDATA["Watching him during the first several minutes of his delivery, Cecilia felt a pleasant sinking sensation in her stomach as she contemplated how deliciously self-destructive it would be, almost erotic, to be married to a man so nearly handsome, so hugely rich, so unfathomably stupid. He would fill her with his big-faced children, all of them loud, boneheaded boys with a passion for guns and football and aeroplanes." -- Ian McEwan]]>
