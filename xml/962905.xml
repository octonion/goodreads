	    <![CDATA["Sometimes it takes a while to recognize that  someone has a special ability to get us to believe in ourselves, to tie that belief to our highest ideals, and to imagine that together we can do great things.

In those rare moments, when such a person comes along, we need to put aside our plans and reach for what we know is possible." -- Caroline Kennedy]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The great enemy of truth is very often not the lie--deliberate, contrived and dishonest--but the myth--persistent, persuasive and unrealistic. Too often we hold fast to the cliches of our forebears. We subject all facts to a prefabricated set of interpretations. We enjoy the comfort of opinion without the discomfort of thought.

&lt;i&gt;[Commencement Address at Yale University, June 11 1962]&lt;/i&gt;" -- John F. Kennedy]]>
