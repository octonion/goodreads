		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["In uncertainty I am certain that underneath their topmost layers of frailty men want to be good and want to be loved. Indeed, most of their vices are attempted shortcuts to love...We have only one story. All novels, all poetry, are built on the neverending contest in ourselves of good and evil. And it occurs to me that evil must constantly respawn, while good, while virtue is immortal. Vice has always a new fresh young face, while virtue is venerable as nothing else in the world is." -- John Steinbeck]]>

	    <![CDATA["The trouble with modern education is you never know how ignorant people are.  With anyone over fifty you can be fairly confident what's been taught and what's been left out.  But these young people have such an intelligent, knowledgeable surface, and then the crust suddenly breaks and you look down into depths of confusion you didn't know existed." -- Evelyn Waugh]]>
