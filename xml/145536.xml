	    <![CDATA["Sunrise

What is the name
of the deep breath I would take
over and over
for all of us? Call it
 
whatever you want, it is
happiness, it is another one
of the ways to enter
fire." -- Mary Oliver]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["We generally describe the most repulsive examples of humanity's cruelty as brutal or bestial, implying by these adjectives that such behaviour is characteristic of less highly developed animals such as ourselves. In truth, however, the extremes of 'brutal' behaviour are confined to humanity; and there is no parallel in nature to our savage treatment of each other. " -- Storr]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I talk to my inner lover, and I say, why such rush? 
  We sense that there is some sort of spirit that loves 
       birds and animals and the ants-- 
  perhaps the same one who gave a radiance to you 
in your mother's womb. 
  Is it logical you would be walking around entirely orphaned now? 
  The truth is you turned away yourself, 
  and decided to go into the dark alone. 
  Now you are tangled up in others, and have forgotten 
       what you once knew, 
  and that's why everything you do has some weird sense of failure in it." -- Kabir]]>
