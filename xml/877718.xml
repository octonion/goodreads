	    <![CDATA["On a whim, he stopped and bought a watch from a sidewalk vendor.  Normally, Billy could not abide keeping time, especially when it was attached to one’s body.  Time was like a relentlessly needy lapdog one had to haul around.  It barked too much and had no sense of loyalty." -- Jim Carroll]]>

	    <![CDATA["It’s all as if words, phrases, images, syntax were small glass beads from a necklace which was wrenched from some neck and spilled on the floor and down the sides of sofa cushions and armchairs and under bookshelves and maybe swallowed by the cat. I’ve got to find all the glass pieces before I can even reorder the color sequence, and restring it and tie it tighter than before. There’s always a splendor in beginning all over. Even if it means getting on one’s knees to search beneath that bookshelf or prospecting through years of lint and ashes beneath those cushions. Even if it means breaking open that cat’s shit, which it conveniently has deposited in a plastic box, more orderly than any secretary could ever hope to be.

Then I’ll appreciate the value of each bead – rather, each word and image – that much more, never wasting another. And I will, I swear to myself, get it all back in time, string it all together, tighter, as I said, than before." -- Jim Carroll]]>
