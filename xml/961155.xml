	    <![CDATA["Vowels were something else. He didn't like them and they didn't like him. There were only five of them, but they seemed to be everywhere. Why, you could go through twenty words without bumping into some of the shyer consonants, but it seemed as if you couldn't tiptoe past a syllable without waking up a vowel. Consonants, you know pretty much where you stood, but you could never trust a vowel." -- Jerry Spinelli]]>

	    <![CDATA["So you're always honest,&quot; I said.
&quot;Aren't you?&quot;
&quot;No,&quot; I told him. &quot;I'm not.&quot;
&quot;Well, that's good to know, I guess.&quot;
&quot;I'm not saying I'm a liar,&quot; I told him. He raised his eyebrows. &quot;That's not how I meant it, anyways.&quot;
&quot;How'd you mean it, then?&quot;
&quot;I just...I don't always say what I feel.&quot;
&quot;Why not?&quot;
&quot;Because the truth sometimes hurts,&quot; I said.
&quot;Yeah,&quot; he said. &quot;So do lies, though." -- Sarah Dessen]]>
