		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I am for an art that imitates the human, that is comic, if necessary, or violent, or whatever is necessary.  I am for an art that takes its form from the lines of life itself, that twists and extends and accumulates and spits and drips, and is heavy and coarse and blunt and sweet and stupid as life itself." -- Claes Oldenburg]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["    I used myself, let nothing use me.
    Like being on a private dole,

    sometimes more like cutting bricks in Egypt.
    What life there was, was mine,

    now and again to lay
    one hand on a warm brick

    and touch the sun's ghost
    with economical joy." -- Adrienne Rich]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Then what is good? The obsessive interest in human affairs, plus a certain amount of compassion and moral conviction, that first made the experience of living something that must be translated into pigment or music or bodily movement or poetry or prose or anything that's dynamic and expressivee--that's what's good for you if you're at all serious in your aims. William Saroyan wrote a great play on this theme, that purity of heart is the one success worth having. &quot;In the time of your life--live!&quot; That time is short and it doesn't return again. It is slipping away while I write this and while you read it, the monosyllable of the clock is Loss, loss, loss, unless you devote your heart to its opposition." -- Tennessee Williams]]>

	    <![CDATA["If the world were merely seductive, that would be easy. If it were merely challenging, that would be no problem. But I arise in the morning torn between a desire to improve the world and a desire to enjoy the world. This makes it hard to plan the day." -- E.B. White]]>
