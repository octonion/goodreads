	    <![CDATA["He realized with a start that something was about to begin.  It might be something dull and uninspiring, something he had experienced countless times before, something that wouldn't make a lick of difference when he died.  But it was always good to have something about to begin." -- nobuko takagi]]>

	    <![CDATA["wash your dress in running water.  dry it on the southern side of a rock.  let them have four guesses and make them all wrong.  take a fistful of snow in the summer heat.  cook haluski in hot sweet butter.  drink cold milk to clean your insides.  be careful when you wake: breathing lets them know how asleep you are.  don't hang your coat from a hook in the door.  ignore curfew.  remember weather by the voice of the wheel.  do not become the fool they need you to become.  change your name.  lose your shoes.  practice doubt.  dress in oiled cloth around sickness.  adore darkness.  turn sideways in the wind.  the changing of stories is a cheerful affair.  give the impression of not having known." -- colum mccann]]>
