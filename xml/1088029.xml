	    <![CDATA["I wanted to tell you that I was so sad I felt as if I might be happy, or in love, simply because such powerful feelings can appear the same to the naive.  I was mighty with grief, and I thought I should be empowered by it.  I thought my hands should shine with a yellow light, and that should I reach out to touch our mother on the head, I would call her back from the place she'd gone." -- Chris Adrian]]>
