	    <![CDATA["... It's perfect! Locke would appreciate it.&quot;

&quot;Bug,&quot; Calo said, &quot;Locke is our brother and our love for him knows no bounds. But the four most fatal words in the Therin language are 'Locke would appreciate it.'&quot;

&quot;Rivalled only by 'Locke taught me a new trick,'&quot; added Galo.

&quot;The only person who gets away with Locke Lamora games ...&quot;

&quot;... is Locke ...&quot;

&quot;... because we think the gods are saving him up for a really big death. Something with knives and hot irons ...&quot;

&quot;... and fifty thousand cheering spectators." -- Scott Lynch]]>

	    <![CDATA["Some day, Locke Lamora,” he said, “some day, you’re going to fuck up so magnificently, so ambitiously, so overwhelmingly that the sky will light up and the moons will spin and the gods themselves will shit comets with glee. And I just hope I’m still around to see it.”
“Oh please,” said Locke. “It’ll never happen." -- Scott Lynch]]>

	    <![CDATA["That's a sweet piece,&quot; said Jean, briefly forgetting to be aggravated. &quot;You didn't snatch that off a street.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; said Locke, before taking another deep draught of the warm water in the decanter. &quot;I got it from the neck of the governor's mistress.&quot;

&quot;You can't be serious.&quot;

&quot;In the governor's manor.&quot;

&quot;Of all the -&quot; 

&quot;In the governor's bed.&quot;

&quot;Damned lunatic!&quot;

&quot;With the governor sleeping next to her.&quot;

The night quiet was broken by the high, distant trill of a whistle, the traditional swarming noise of city watches everywhere. Several other whistles joined in a few moments later.

&quot;It is possible,&quot; said Locke with a sheepish grin, &quot;that I have been slightly too bold." -- Scott Lynch]]>

	    <![CDATA["I've got kids that &lt;i&gt;enjoy&lt;/i&gt; stealing. I've got kids that don't think about stealing one way or the other, and I've got kids that just &lt;i&gt;tolerate&lt;/i&gt; stealing because they know they've got nothing else to do. But nobody--and I mean &lt;i&gt;nobody&lt;/i&gt;--has ever been hungry for it like this boy. If he had a bloody gash across his throat and a physiker was trying to sew it up, Lamora would steal the needle and thread and die laughing. He...steals &lt;i&gt;too much&lt;/i&gt;." -- Scott Lynch]]>
