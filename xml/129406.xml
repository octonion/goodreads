	    <![CDATA["I haven't any right to criticize books, and I don't do it except when I hate them. I often want to criticize Jane Austen, but her books madden me so that I can't conceal my frenzy from the reader; and therefore I have to stop every time I begin. Every time I read Pride and Prejudice I want to dig her up and beat her over the skull with her own shin-bone." -- Mark Twain]]>

	    <![CDATA["Do not let your fire go out, spark by irreplaceable spark in the hopeless swamps of the not-quite, the not-yet, and the not-at-all. Do not let the hero in your soul perish in lonely frustration for the life you deserved and have never been able to reach. The world you desire can be won. It exists.. it is real.. it is possible.. it's yours." -- Ayn Rand]]>

&quot;What?&quot;
&quot;You're all alike here.&quot;
&quot;How so?&quot; he asked.
&quot;You demand adoration for the place.  You're not happy until &lt;i&gt;everybody&lt;/i&gt; swears undying love for every nook and cranny of every precious damn --&quot;
&quot;Whoa, missy.&quot;
&quot;Well, it's true.  Can't you just worship it on your own?  Do I have to sign an affadavit?&quot;
