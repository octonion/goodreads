I go you go,my dear; and whatever is done by only me is your doing,my darling)
I fear no fate (for you are my fate,my sweet)I want no world (for beautiful you are my world,my true)
and it's you are whatever a moon has always meant and whatever a sun will always sing is you

here is the deepest secret nobody knows
(here is the root of the root and the bud of the bud and the sky of the sky of a tree called life; which grows
higher than the soul can hope or mind can hide)
and this is the wonder that's keeping the stars apart

I carry your heart (I carry it in my heart)" -- E.E. Cummings]]>

	    <![CDATA["But is it such a bad thing to live like this for just a little while? Just for a few months of one's life, is it so awful to travel through time with no greater ambition than to find the next lovely meal? Or to learn how to speak a language for no higher purpose than that it pleases your ear to hear it? Or to nap in a garden, in a patch of sunlight, in the middle of the day, right next to your favourite fountain? And then to do it again the next day?" -- Elizabeth Gilbert]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I ask the impossible: love me forever.
Love me when all desire is gone.
Love me with the single mindedness of a monk.
When the world in its entirety,
and all that you hold sacred advise you
against it: love me still more.
When rage fills you and has no name: love me.
When each step from your door to our job tires you--
love me; and from job to home again, love me, love me.
Love me when you're bored--
when every woman you see is more beautiful than the last,
or more pathetic, love me as you always have:
not as admirer or judge, but with
the compassion you save for yourself
in your solitude.
Love me as you relish your loneliness,
the anticipation of your death,
mysteries of the flesh, as it tears and mends.
Love me as your most treasured childhood memory--
and if there is none to recall--
imagine one, place me there with you.
Love me withered as you loved me new.
Love me as if I were forever--
and I, will make the impossible
a simple act,
by loving you, loving you as I do" -- Ana Castillo]]>

	    <![CDATA["There's a Polar Bear
In our Frigidaire--
He likes it 'cause it's cold in there.
With his seat in the meat
And his face in the fish
And his big hairy paws
In the buttery dish,
He's nibbling the noodles,
And munching the rice,
He's slurping the soda,
He's licking the ice.
And he lets out a roar
If you open the door.
And it gives me a scare
To know he's in there--
That Polary Bear
In our Fridgitydaire." -- Shel Silverstein]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Come live with me and be my love 
And we will all the pleasures prove 
Of a marriage conducted with economy 
In the Twentieth Century Anno Donomy. 
We’ll live in a dear little walk-up flat 
With practically room to swing a cat 
And a potted cactus to give it hauteur 
And a bathtub equipped with dark brown water. 
We’ll eat, without undue discouragement, 
Foods low in cost but high in nouragement 
And quaff with pleasure, while chatting wittily,
The peculiar wine of Little Italy. 
We’ll remind each other it’s smart to be thrifty
And buy our clothes for something-fifty. 
We’ll bus for miles on holidays 
For seas at depressing matinees, 
And every Sunday we’ll have a lark 
And take a walk in Central Park. 
And one of these days not too remote 
You’ll probably up and cut my throat." -- Ogden Nash]]>
