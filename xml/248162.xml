		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["...being human always points, and is directed, to something, or someone, other than oneself—be it meaning to fulfill or another human being to encounter. The more one forgets himself—by giving himself to a cause to serve or another person to love—the more human he is and the more he actualizes himself.... What is called self-actualization is not an attainable aim at all, for the simple reason that the more one would strive for it, the more he would miss it. In other words, self-actualization is possible only as a side-effect of self-transcendence." -- Viktor E. Frankl]]>

	    <![CDATA["It was always hard work to push through a crowed of reporters with the scent of blood in their nostrils. You might not think so, since on camera they appear to be brain-damaged wimps with severe eating disorders. But put them at a police barricade and a miraculous thing happens...The strength comes from some mysterious place-and somehow, when there is gore on the ground, these anorexic creatures can push their way through anything. Without mussing their hair, too." -- Jeff Lindsay]]>

	    <![CDATA["The show tries to offer its young female characters postfeminist identities that break down gender boundaries and hybridize gendered characteristics to produce new versions of power and heroism...being a woman involves work, work of constant self-(re)construction. Buffy's female characters are represented as always working in this way, whether to come to terms with power, or to maintain a &quot;successful &quot;good-girl&quot; identity..." -- Lorna Jowett]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The beatings are further proof that Spike's &quot;humiliation,&quot; the level to which he has sunk, and a physical sign of vulnerability. But they are also &quot;sexy wounds&quot; (as Buffy playing Robot-Buffy says in &quot;Intervention&quot;), since Spike's body is displayed to be looked at. Further, as with Angel and Dru, Spike and Buffy's relationship uses pain/violence as eroticism (when Spike tells Buddy &quot;I love you,&quot; she responds &quot;You're in love with pain&quot; [&quot;Smashed&quot;]). Mulvey's association of voyeurism, sadism, and narrative is useful here." -- Lorna Jowett]]>

	    <![CDATA["Transgressions is the attraction of any dead boy, but as with openness of other more minor characters, this functions both to enlarge and restrict their potential as alternative gender representations.
