		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Books help to form us. If you cut me open, you will find volume after volume, page after page, the contents of every one I have ever read, somehow transmuted and transformed into me. Alice in Wonderland. the Magic Faraway Tree. The Hound of the Baskervilles. The Book of Job. Bleak House. Wuthering Heights. The Complete Poems of W H Auden. The Tale of Mr Tod. Howard''s End. What a strange person I must be. But if the books I have read have helped to form me, then probably nobody else who ever lived has read exactly the same books, all the same books and only the same books as me. So just as my genes and the soul within me make me uniquely me, so I am the unique sum of the books I have read. I am my literary DNA." -- Susan Hill]]>

&lt;i&gt;There was a couple in the cottage. You could have given them something, but you left. And for what?&lt;/i&gt; 

&lt;i&gt;There was a dancing girl in the marketplace. You could have helped her, but you left. And for what?&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;There was a boy and his bird sister. He helped you, and you gave him nothing.&lt;/i&gt; 

&lt;i&gt;There was a swanskin, and you thought it might make you beautiful.&lt;/i&gt; 

&lt;i&gt;There were red shoes, and you thought they might make you graceful.&lt;/i&gt; 

&lt;i&gt;There was a threshold and a magical woods, and you thought they might make you a hero.&lt;/i&gt; 

&lt;i&gt;There was a boy, and he was your best friend.&lt;/i&gt; 

&lt;i&gt;Your father left you. You left your mother.&lt;/i&gt; 

&lt;i&gt;Come&lt;/i&gt;, the wind said, &lt;i&gt;and I will blow you away&lt;/i&gt;.

And you have to think very carefully about whether you want to cross it, because once you do it’s very hard to get back to the world you left behind. And sometimes you break a barrier that no one knew existed, and then everything you knew before crossing the line is gone. 

But sometimes you have a friend to rescue. And so you take a deep breath and then step over the line and into the darkness ahead." -- Anne Ursu]]>

	    <![CDATA["I’m completely library educated. I’ve never been to college. I went down to the library when I was in grade school in Waukegan, and in high school in Los Angeles, and spent long days every summer in the library. I used to steal magazines from a store on Genesee Street, in Waukegan, and read them and then steal them back on the racks again. That way I took the print off with my eyeballs and stayed honest. I didn’t want to be a permanent thief, and I was very careful to wash my hands before I read them. But with the library, it’s like catnip, I suppose: you begin to run in circles because there’s so much to look at and read. And it’s far more fun than going to school, simply because you make up your own list and you don’t have to listen to anyone. When I would see some of the books my kids were forced to bring home and read by some of their teachers, and were graded on—well, what if you don’t like those books?

I am a librarian. I discovered me in the library. I went to find me in the library. Before I fell in love with libraries, I was just a six-year-old boy. The library fueled all of my curiosities, from dinosaurs to ancient Egypt. When I graduated from high school in 1938, I began going to the library three nights a week. I did this every week for almost ten years and finally, in 1947, around the time I got married, I figured I was done. So I graduated from the library when I was twenty-seven. I discovered that the library is the real school." -- Ray Bradbury]]>
