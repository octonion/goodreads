		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I wanted all things
To seem to make some sense,

Instead of tense.
And I made up lies
So that they all fit nice,
And I made this sad world
A par-a-dise." -- Kurt Vonnegut]]>

But conversely, the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man&amp;mdash;for precisely the same reasons." -- Douglas Adams]]>
