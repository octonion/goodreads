	    <![CDATA["When you're dodging, you're &quot;afraid of getting hit.&quot; When you're attacking, you're &quot;afraid of hitting me.&quot; When you're protecting someone, you're &quot;afraid of them dying.&quot;

It's pathetic! You can't give into fear in a fight!

When you're dodging, think &quot;I won't let you hit me!&quot; When you're protecting someone, think &quot;I won't let you die!&quot; When you're attacking, think &quot;I will cut you!&quot;
