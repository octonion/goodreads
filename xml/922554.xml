	    <![CDATA["But in the end, there will still be a morning like this one, full of new light, and a distant voice will be heard, like a memory of before we became people.  And the tones of a song will well up, the gentle lull of the first mother.  This song, yes indeed, will be ours, the memory of a deep root that they were unable to wrench out of us.  This voice will give us the strength for a new beginning, and upon hearing it, the corpses will find peace in their graves and the survivors will embrace life with the simple joy of young lovers.  All this will happen if we are able to rid ourselves of this time that has made animals out of us.  Let us strive to die like the people we no longer are." -- Mia Couto]]>
