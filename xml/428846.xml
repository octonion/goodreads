	    <![CDATA["On Saturday mornings during deliveries, I'd practice picking out new words in Jane Eyre, sounding out the ones that needed sounding out—and I'm not lying, there were plenty. &quot;'A new servitude! There is something in that,' I soliloquized.&quot; I mean, who talks like that? Do you know how long it takes to sound out a word like soliloquized? And even after you do, you have no idea what the stupid word means except that it probably just means &quot;said,&quot; which is what stupid Charlotte Brontë should have said in the first place. When I delivered Mrs. Mason's groceries, she saw that I had Jane Eyre stuck under my arm. &quot;Oh,&quot; she said, &quot;that was my favorite novel in school.&quot; &quot;It was?&quot; I soliloquized." -- Gary D.

	    <![CDATA["Life is like a bad haircut. At first it looks awful, then you kind of get used to it, and before you know it, it it grows out and you gotta get another haircut that maybe won't be so bad, unless of course you keep going to SuperClips, where the hairstylists are so terrible they oughta be using safety scissors, and when they're done you look like your head got caught in a ceiling fan. So life goes on, good haircut, bad haircut, until finally you go bald, and it don't matter no more.
 I told this wisdom to my mother, and she said I oughta put it in a book, then burn it. Some people just can't appreciate the profound." -- Neal Shusterman]]>
