		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["A writer never forgets the first time he accepted a few coins or a word of praise in exchange for a story. He will never forget the sweet poison of vanity in his blood and the belief that, if he succeeds in not letting anyone discover his lack of talent, the dream of literature will provide him with a roof over his head, a hot meal at the end of the day, and what he covets the most: his name printed on a miserable piece of paper that surely will outlive him. A writer is condemned to remember that moment, because from then on he is doomed and his soul has a price." -- Carlos Ruiz Zafon]]>

	    <![CDATA["The thing about Tolkien, about &lt;i&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/i&gt;, is that it's perfect.  It's this whole world, this whole process of immersion, this journey.  It's not, I'm pretty sure, actually true, but that makes it more amazing, that someone could make it all up.  Reading it changes everything." -- Jo Walton]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I spent my life folded between the pages of books.
In the absence of human relationships I formed bonds with paper characters. I lived love and loss through stories threaded in history; I experienced adolescence by association. My world is one interwoven web of words, stringing limb to limb, bone to sinew, thoughts and images all together. I am a being comprised of letters, a character created by sentences, a figment of imagination formed through fiction." -- Tahereh Mafi]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Think of the most fussy science teacher you ever had. The one who docked your grade if the sixth decimal place in your answer was rounded incorrectly; who tucked in his periodic table T-shirt, corrected every student who said &quot;weight&quot; when he or she meant &quot;mass&quot;, and made everyone, including himself, wear goggles even while mixing sugar water. Now try to imagine someone whom your teacher would hate for being anal-retentive. That is the kind of person who works for a bureau of standards and measurement." -- Sam Kean]]>
