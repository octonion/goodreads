		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["To my unsuspecting love.
When I look into your eyes, I lose all sense of time and place. Reason robbed, clear thought erased, I am lost in the paradise I find within your gaze.
I long to touch your blushing cheek, to whisper in your ear how I adore you, how I have lost my heart to you, how I cannot bear the thought of living without you.
To be so near to you without touching you is agony. Your blindness to my feelings is a daily torment, and I feel driven to the edge of madness by my love for you.
Where is your compassion when I need it most? Open your eyes , Love, and see what is right before you: that I am not merely a friend, but a man deeply, desperately , in love with you.
Longing for you." -- Julianne Donaldson]]>

	    <![CDATA["Philip stood with the tip of a sword pressed into Mr. Beaufort’s throat. I saw another sword on the floor. Neither gentleman looked toward the door. Philip looked perfectly in control, his sword bending the skin of Mr. Beaufort’s neck without piercing it. When he spoke, though, his voice sounded so fierce I hardly recognized it. “Tell me what you did to her.” 
“I made sure you wouldn’t want her anymore.” 
“I will always want her,” Philip said in a quiet, furious voice. “Always! There is nothing you could do to change that.” 
Mr. Beaufort sneered. “Then why do you want to know?”
“Because I would never make her say the words. And because I want to know how much I should enjoy running you through." -- Julianne Donaldson]]>
