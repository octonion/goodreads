	    <![CDATA["You’re allowed to believe in a god. You’re allowed to believe unicorns live in your shoes for all I care. But the day you start telling me how to wear my shoes so I don’t upset the unicorns, I have a problem with you. The day you start involving the unicorns in making decisions for this country, I have a BIG problem with you." -- Matthew Shultz]]>

	    <![CDATA["Apocalypse does not point to a fiery Armageddon but to the fact that our ignorance and our complacency are coming to an end… The exclusivism of there being only one way in which we can be saved, the idea that there is a single religious group that is in sole possession of the truth—that is the world as we know it that must pass away.  What is the kingdom?  It lies in our realization of the ubiquity of the divine presence in our neighbors, in our enemies, in all of us." -- Joseph Campbell]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["There seem to be only two kinds of people:  Those who think that metaphors are facts, and those who know that they are not facts.  Those who know they are not facts are what we call &quot;atheists,&quot; and those who think they are facts are &quot;religious.&quot;  Which group really gets the message?" -- Joseph Campbell]]>

	    <![CDATA["With the moon walk, the religious myth that sustained these notions could no longer be held.  With our view of earthrise, we could see that the earth and the heavens were no longer divided but that the earth is in the heavens.  (105)" -- Joseph Campbell]]>
