	    <![CDATA["Because even if they are doing something immoral, I'd be an idiot to start criticizing them for it if I wasn't perfect myself.  Smoking is self-destructive.  Drinking is self-destructive. Losing your temper and yelling at people is wrong.  Lying is wrong. Cheating is wrong. Stealing is wrong.  But people do that stuff all the time.  Soon as I figure out how to be a perfect human being, then I'm qualified to go lecture other people about how they live their lives." -- Jim Butcher]]>

	    <![CDATA["Anything outside yourself, this you can see and apply your logic to it. But it’s a human trait that when we encounter personal problems, these things most deeply personal are the most difficult to bring out for our logic to scan. We tend to flounder around, blaming everything but the actual, deep-seated thing that’s really chewing on us." -- Frank Herbert]]>
