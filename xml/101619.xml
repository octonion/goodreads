		<description>
	    <![CDATA["A soulmate is someone who has locks that fit our keys, and keys to fit our locks. When we feel safe enough to open the locks, our truest selves step out and we can be completely and honestly who we are; we can be loved for who we are and not for who we’re pretending to be. Each unveils the best part of the other. No matter what else goes wrong around us, with that one person we’re safe in our own paradise. Our soulmate is someone who shares our deepest longings, our sense of direction. When we’re two balloons, and together our direction is up, chances are we’ve found the right person. Our soulmate is the one who makes life come to life. " -- Richard Bach]]>

The power men possess to annoy me I give them by a weak curiosity. No man can come near me but through my act." -- Ralph Waldo Emerson]]>

People close an undecided mind because they're trying to protect those sore uncertainties from getting bumped and scraped." -- John Barnese]]>
