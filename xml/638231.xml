		<description>
	    <![CDATA["But&amp;mdash;let me tell you my cat joke. It's very short and simple. A hostess is giving a dinner party and she's got a lovely five-pound T-bone steak sitting on the sideboard in the kitchen waiting to be cooked while she chats with the guests in the living room&amp;mdash;has a few drinks and whatnot. But then she excuses herself to go into the kitchen to cook the steak&amp;mdash;and it's gone. And there's the family cat, in the corner, sedately washing it's face.&quot;

&quot;The cat got the steak,&quot; Barney said.

&quot;Did it? The guests are called in; they argue about it. The steak is gone, all five pounds of it; there sits the cat, looking well-fed and cheerful. &quot;Weigh the cat,&quot; someone says. They've had a few drinks; it looks like a good idea. So they go into the bathroom and weigh the cat on the scales. It reads exactly five pounds. They all perceive this reading and a guest says, &quot;okay, that's it. There's the steak.&quot; They're satisfied that they know what happened, now; they've got empirical proof. Then a qualm comes to one of them and he says, puzzled, &quot;But where's the cat?" -- Philip K. Dick]]>

	    <![CDATA["I agree that it's a shame some books have to suffer ratings that clearly are invalid. However I can't think of a way to prevent it, and I didn't see any ideas in the thread either (I did skim though). 

I hope you'll appreciate that if we just start deleting ratings whenever we feel like it, that we've gone down a censorship road that doesn't take us to a good place." -- Otis Y. Chandler]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["There are books full of great writing that don't have very good stories. Read sometimes for the story... don't be like the book-snobs who won't do that. Read sometimes for the words--the language. Don't be like the play-it-safers who won't do that. But when you find a book that has both a good story and good words, treasure that book." -- Stephen King]]>
