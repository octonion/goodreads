		<description>
	    <![CDATA["So they were pen pals now, Emma composing long, intense letters crammed with jokes and underlining, forced banter and barely concealed longing; two-thousand-word acts of love on air-mail paper. Letters, like compilation tapes, were really vehicles for unexpressed emotions and she was clearly putting far too much time and energy into them. In return, Dexter sent her postcards with insufficient postage: ‘Amsterdam is MAD’, ‘Barcelona INSANE’, ‘Dublin ROCKS. Sick as DOG this morning.’ As a travel writer, he was no Bruce Chatwin, but still she would slip the postcards in the pocket of a heavy coat on long soulful walks on Ilkley Moor, searching for some hidden meaning in ‘VENICE COMPLETELY FLOODED!!!!" -- David Nicholls]]>

	    <![CDATA["You can dance. 
You can make me laugh.
You've got x-ray eyes. 

You know how to sing. 
You're a diplomat. 
You've got it all. 
Everybody loves you. 

You can charm the birds out of the sky, But I, I've got 
one thing. 

You always know just what to say 
And when to go, 
But I've got one thing. 

You can see in the dark, 
But I've got one thing: 
I loved you better. 

Last night I woke up,
Saw this angel. 
He flew in my window. 
And he said, 
Girl, pretty proud of yourself, huh?&quot; And I looked around and said, 
Who me?&quot; 
And he said, &quot;The higher you fly, the faster you fall.&quot;

He said, &quot;Send it up. 
Watch it rise. 
See it fall, 
Gravity's rainbow. 
Send it up. 
Watch it rise. 
See it fall, 
Gravity's Angel." -- Laurie Anderson]]>
