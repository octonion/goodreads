	    <![CDATA["And would it have been worth it, after all,
After the cups, the marmalade, the tea,
Among the porcelain, among some tal of you and me,
Would it have been worth while,
To have bitten off the matter with a smile,
To have squeezed the universe into a ball
To roll it toward some overwhelming question,,
To say: &quot;I am Lazarus, come from the dead,
Come back to tell you all, I shall tell you all' - 
If one, settling a pillow by her head,
Should say: &quot;That is not what I meant at all.
That is not it, at all." -- T.S. Eliot]]>

	    <![CDATA["Follows here the strict receipt
For that sauce to faint meat,
Named idleness, which many eat
By preference, and call it sweet:
First watch for morsels, like a hound
Mix well with buffets, stir them round
With good thick oil of flattered,
And froth with mean self-lauding lies.
Serve warm: the vessels you must choose
To keep it in are dead men's shoes." -- George Eliot]]>
