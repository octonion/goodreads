	    <![CDATA["A lot of people don’t know who they really are inside. and some do but they suppress it because they are too scared to be themselves. It’s better to be a good person who is respected, rather then a lost generic one who follows the crowd. Be yourself anyway, even if no one knows you but YOU, continue to love yourself, have patience my friend. Someday others will turn around and see what a neat person they missed out on getting to know. And believe me, having the strength to be yourself is truly courageous." -- Tina Bartlett. Mitchell]]>

	    <![CDATA["you will never EVER regret choosing to be KIND. Every day we are given the opportunity to be kind or mean. It's amazing the times I have chosen to be kind to a stranger, and then had another chance in the future to interact with them again. What if the situation was me being mean, people have good memories, and could remember your face and actions. It's up to you to decide what you want to be remembered for. Choose love, and choose forgiveness you won't regret it." -- Tina Bartlett Mitchell]]>

	    <![CDATA["Whatever we become in life we either &quot;let happen&quot; or we consciously CREATE to be. One puts you in a VICTIM pit, the other makes you rise a VICTOR. You have to make this choice, YOU have to do the work. No one can do it for you." -- Tina Mitchell]]>
