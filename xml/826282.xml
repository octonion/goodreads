	    <![CDATA["I don't like you, Park,&quot; she said, sounding for a second like she actually meant it. &quot;I...&quot; - her voice nearly disappeared - &quot;think I live for you.&quot;
He closed his eyes and pressed his head back into his pillow.
&quot;I don't think I even breathe when we're not together,&quot; she whispered. &quot;Which means, when I see you on Monday morning, it's been like sixty hours since I've taken a breath. That's probably why I'm so crabby, and why I snap at you. All I do when we're apart is think about you, and all I do when we're together is panic. Because every second feels so important. And because I'm so out of control, I can't help myself. I'm not even mine anymore, I'm yours, and what if you decide that you don't want me? How could you want me like I want you?&quot;
He was quiet. He wanted everything she'd just said to be the last thing he heard. He wanted to fall asleep with 'I want you' in his ears." -- Rainbow Rowell]]>

	    <![CDATA["Damn, damn, damn,&quot; she said. &quot;I never said why I like you, and now I have to go.&quot;
&quot;That's okay,&quot; he said.
&quot;It's because you're kind,&quot; she said. &quot;And because you get all my jokes...&quot;
&quot;Okay.&quot; He laughed.
&quot;And you're smarter than I am.&quot;
&quot;I am not.&quot;
&quot;And you look like a protagonist.&quot; She was talking as fast as she could think. &quot;You look like the person who wins in the end. You're so pretty, and so good. You have magic eyes,&quot; she whispered. &quot;And you make me feel like a cannibal.&quot;
&quot;You're crazy.&quot;
&quot;I have to go.&quot; She leaned over so the receiver was close to the base.
&quot;Eleanor - wait,&quot; Park said. She could hear her dad in the kitchen and her heartbeat everywhere.
&quot;Eleanor - wait - I love you." -- Rainbow Rowell]]>
