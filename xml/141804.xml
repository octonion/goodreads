		<description>
	    <![CDATA["When the morning light came into the room it found them curled together in a nest of red and white sheets.  It revealed also marks, all over the pale cool skin: handprints around the narrow waist, sliding impressions from delicate strokes, like weals, raised rosy discs where his lips had rested lightly.  He cried out, when he saw her, that he had hurt her.  No, she said, she was part icewoman, it was her nature, she had an icewoman's skin that responded to every touch by blossoming red.  Sasan still stared, and repeated, I have hurt you.  No, no, said Fiammarosa, they are the marks of pleasure, pure pleasure.  I shall cover them up, for only we ourselves should see our happiness.

But inside her a little melted pool of water slopped and swayed where she had been solid and shining." -- A. S. Byatt]]>

	    <![CDATA["When I was a child, adults would tell me not to make things up, warning me of what would happen if I did. As far as I can tell so far, it seems to involve lots of foreign travel and not having to get up too early in the morning." -- Neil Gaiman]]>

	    <![CDATA["It struck me as pretty ridiculous to be called Mr. Darcy and to stand on your own looking snooty at a party. It's like being called Heathcliff and insisting on spending the entire evening in the garden, shouting &quot;Cathy&quot; and banging your head against a tree." -- Helen Fielding]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["And on the subject of burning books: I want to congratulate librarians, not famous for their physical strength or their powerful political connections or their great wealth, who, all over this country, have staunchly resisted anti-democratic bullies who have tried to remove certain books from their shelves, and have refused to reveal to thought police the names of persons who have checked out those titles.

So the America I loved still exists, if not in the White House or the Supreme Court or the Senate or the House of Representatives or the media. The America I love still exists at the front desks of our public libraries." -- Kurt Vonnegut]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Most people don't realize how important librarians are. I ran across a book recently which suggested that the peace and prosperity of a culture was solely related to how many librarians it contained. Possibly a slight overstatement. But a culture that doesn't value its librarians doesn't value ideas and without ideas, well, where are we?" -- Neil Gaiman]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["All morning I struggled with the sensation of stray wisps of one world seeping through the cracks of another. Do you know the feeling when you start reading a new book before the membrane of the last one has had time to close behind you?  You leave the previous book with ideas and themes -- characters even -- caught in the fibers of your clothes, and when you open the new book, they are still with you." -- Diane Setterfield]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Short fiction seems more targeted - hand grenades of ideas, if you will.  When they work, they hit, they explode, and you never forget them.  Long fiction feels more like atmosphere: it's a lot smokier and less defined." -- Paolo Bacigalupi]]>

	    <![CDATA["Do you know what religion is, Martin, my friend?
-I can barely remember Lord's Prayer.
-A beautiful and well-crafted prayer. Poetry aside, a religion is really a moral code that is expressed through legends,myths, or any type of literary device in order to establish a system of beliefs, values , and rules with which to regulate a culture or a society." -- Carlos Ruiz Zafón]]>
