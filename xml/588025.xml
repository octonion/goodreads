	    <![CDATA["The dove descending breaks the air
With flame of incandescent terror
Of which the tongues declare
The one discharge from sin and error.
The only hope, or else despair
Lies in the choice of pyre or pyre-
To be redeemed from fire by fire.
  
Who then devised the torment?  Love.
Love is the unfamiliar Name
Behind the hands that wove
The intolerable shirt of flame
Which human power cannot remove.
We only live, only suspire
Consumed by either fire or fire." -- T.S. Eliot]]>

	    <![CDATA["Every man has some reminiscences which he would not tell to everyone, but only to his friends. He has others which he would not reveal even to his friends, but only to himself, and that in secret. But finally there are still others which a man is even afraid to tell himself, and every decent man has a considerable number of such things stored away.  That is, one can even say that the more decent he is, the greater the number of such things in his mind." -- Fyodor Dostoevsky]]>

There is no map 
and there is no road. 
It is one of a kind 
just as yours is." -- Anne Sexton]]>
