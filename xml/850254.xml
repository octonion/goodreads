	    <![CDATA["Dear Delphine, 
When you are older I want you to find Chinua Achebe. I want you to read Things Fall Apart. Don't be hardheaded and try to read this book now.  Don't be hardheaded, Delphine. You are the smart one, but you are not ready. You can read all its words. Even the African words. But you will not know what Achebe is saying. It is a bad thing to bite into a hard fruit with little teeth. You will say bad things about the fruit when the problem is your teeth. 
I want you to read this book. I want you to know Things Fall Apart. Fourteen is a good age to find Chinua Achebe. 
Nzila. 
Your Mother.
P.S. For now you are eleven. Be eleven." -- Rita Williams-Garcia]]>
