	    <![CDATA["As I walked out one evening,
  Walking down Bristol Street,
The crowds upon the pavement
  Were fields of harvest wheat.

And down by the brimming river
  I heard a lover sing
Under an arch of the railway:
  &quot;Love has no ending.

&quot;I'll love you, dear, I'll love you
  Till China and Africa meet,
And the river jumps over the mountain
  And the salmon sing in the street,

&quot;I'll love till the ocean
  Is folded and hung up to dry
And the seven stars go squawking
  Like geese about the sky.

&quot;The years shall run like rabbits,
  For in my arms I hold
The Flower of the Ages,
  And the first love of the world.&quot;

But all the clocks in the city
  Began to whirr and chime:
&quot;O let not Time deceive you,
  You cannot conquer Time.

&quot;In the burrows of the Nightmare
  Where Justice naked is,
Time watches from the shadow
  And coughs when you would kiss.

&quot;In headaches and in worry
  Vaguely life leaks away,
And Time will have his fancy
  Tomorrow or today.

&quot;Into many a green valley
  Drifts the appalling snow;
Time breaks the threaded dances
  And the diver's brilliant bow.

&quot;O plunge your hands in water,
  Plunge them in up to the wrist;
Stare, stare in the basin
  And wonder what you've missed.

&quot;The glacier knocks in the cupboard,
  The desert sighs in the bed,
And the crack in the teacup opens
  A lane to the land of the dead.

&quot;Where the beggars raffle the banknotes
  And the Giant is enchanting to Jack,
And the Lily-white Boy is a Roarer,
  And Jill goes down on her back.

&quot;O look, look in the mirror,
  O look in your distress;
Life remains a blessing
  Although you cannot bless.

&quot;O stand, stand at the window
  As the tears scald and start;
You shall love your crooked neighbor
  With all your crooked heart.&quot;

It was late, late in the evening,
 The lovers they were gone;
The clocks had ceased their chiming,
 And the deep river ran on." -- W.H. Auden]]>
