	    <![CDATA["My kids are starting to notice I'm a little different from the other dads. &quot;Why don't you have a straight job like everyone else?&quot; they asked me the other day. 

I told them this story: 
In the forest, there was a crooked tree and a straight tree. Every day, the straight tree would say to the crooked tree, &quot;Look at me...I'm tall, and I'm straight, and I'm handsome. Look at you...you're all crooked and bent over. No one wants to look at you.&quot; And they grew up in that forest together. And then one day the loggers came, and they saw the crooked tree and the straight tree, and they said, &quot;Just cut the straight trees and leave the rest.&quot; So the loggers turned all the straight trees into lumber and toothpicks and paper. And the crooked tree is still there, growing stronger and stranger every day." -- Tom Waits]]>
