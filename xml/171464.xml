	    <![CDATA["It's lovely to live on a raft. We had
the sky, up there, all speckled with stars, and we used to lay on
our backs and look up at them, and discuss about whether they was
made, or only just happened- Jim he allowed they was made, but I
allowed they happened; I judged it would have took too long to make so
many." -- Mark Twain]]>

	    <![CDATA["A joker is a little fool who is different from everyone else. He's not a club, diamond, heart, or spade. He's not an eight or a nine, a king or a jack. He is an outsider. He is placed in the same pack as the other cards, but he doesn't belong there. Therefore, he can be removed without anybody missing him." -- Jostein Gaarder]]>

	    <![CDATA["Above all, don't lie to yourself.

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["One of the major mistakes people make is that they think manners are only the expression of happy ideas. There’s a whole range of behavior that can be expressed in a mannerly way. That’s what civilization is all about — doing it in a mannerly and not an antagonistic way. One of the places we went wrong was the naturalistic, Rousseauean movement of the Sixties in which people said, ”Why can’t you just say what’s on your mind?” In civilization there have to be some restraints. If we followed every impulse, we’d be killing one another." -- Judith Martin]]>
