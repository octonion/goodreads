	    <![CDATA["It [the trip] captured five very long hours. If you want to know why, it is because Grandfather is Grandfather first and a driver second. He made us lost often and became on his nerves. I had to translate his anger into useful information for the hero. &quot;Fuck,&quot; Grandfather said. I said, &quot;He says that if you look at the statues, you can see that some no longer endure. Those are where Communist statues used to be.&quot; &quot;Fucking fuck, fuck!&quot; Grandfather shouted. &quot;Oh,&quot; I said, &quot;he wants you to know that that building, that building, and that building are all important.&quot; &quot;Why?&quot; the hero inquired. &quot;Fuck!&quot; Grandfather said. &quot;He cannot remember,&quot; I said." -- Jonathan Safran Foer]]>
