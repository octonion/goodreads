	    <![CDATA["The site of his thinking and writing was a small office wedged in one corner of his shaggy house, on whose door he’d installed a lock to keep his sons out.  They gathered wistfully outside it, his boys, with their chipped, heartbreaking faces.  They were not permitted to so much as knock upon the door to the room in which he thought and wrote about art, but Ted hadn’t found a way to keep them from prowling outside it, ghostly feral creatures drinking from a pond in moonlight, their bare feet digging at the carpet, their fingers sweating on the walls, leaving spoors of grease that Ted would point out each week to Elsa, the cleaning woman.  He would sit in his office, listening to the movements of his boys, imagining that he felt their hot, curious breath.  I will not let them in, he would tell himself.  I will sit and think about art.  But he found, to his despair, that often he couldn’t think about art.  He thought about nothing at all." -- Jennifer Egan]]>
