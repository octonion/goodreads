	    <![CDATA["I got schooled this year
&lt;b&gt;by
a
boy&lt;/b&gt;.

A boy that I'm &lt;b&gt;seriously, deeply, madly, incredibly, and undeniably&lt;/b&gt; in &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;love&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; with.
And he taught me the most important thing of &lt;b&gt;all&lt;/b&gt;...

To put the &lt;b&gt;emphasis&lt;/b&gt;
On &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;life&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;." -- Colleen Hoover]]>

	    <![CDATA["Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do." -- Apple Computer Inc.]]>

	    <![CDATA["I've been making a list of the things they don't teach you at school. They don't teach you how to love somebody. They don't teach you how to be famous. They don't teach you how to be rich or how to be poor. They don't teach you how to walk away from someone you don't love any longer. They don't teach you how to know what's going on in someone else's mind. They don't teach you what to say to someone who's dying. They don't teach you anything worth knowing." -- Neil Gaiman]]>
