	    <![CDATA["So what do you do when you are stuck?

The first thing I do when I am stuck is pray.  But I’m not talking about a quick, Help me Lord, Sunday’s a comin’ prayer.  When I get stuck I get up from my desk to head for my closet.  Literally.  If I‘m at the office I go over to a corner that I have deemed my closet away from home.  I get on my knees and remind God that this was not my idea, it was His…

None of this is new information to God…

Then I ask God to show me if there is something He wants to say to prepare me for what He wants me to communicate to our congregation.  I surrender my ideas, my outline and my topic.  Then I just stay in that quiet place until God quiets my heart…

Many times I will have a breakthrough thought or idea that brings clarity to my message. . .

Like you, I am simply a mouthpiece.  Getting stuck is one way God keeps me ever conscious of that fact." -- Andy Stanley]]>
