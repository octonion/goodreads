		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Night poured over the desert. It came suddenly, in purple. In the clear air, the stars drilled down out of the sky, reminding any thoughtful watcher that it is in the deserts and high places that religions are generated. When men see nothing but bottomless infinity over their heads they have always had a driving and desperate urge to find someone to put in the way." -- Terry Pratchett ]]>

	    <![CDATA["All right,&quot; said Susan. &quot;I'm not stupid. You're saying humans need... &lt;i&gt;fantasies&lt;/i&gt; to make life bearable.&quot;

REALLY? AS IF IT WAS SOME KIND OF PINK PILL? NO. HUMANS NEED FANTASY TO BE HUMAN. TO BE THE PLACE WHERE THE FALLING ANGEL MEETS THE RISING APE.

&quot;Tooth fairies? Hogfathers? Little—&quot;

YES. AS PRACTICE. YOU HAVE TO START OUT LEARNING TO BELIEVE THE &lt;i&gt;LITTLE&lt;/i&gt; LIES.

&quot;So we can believe the big ones?&quot;

YES. JUSTICE. MERCY. DUTY. THAT SORT OF THING.

&quot;They're not the same at all!&quot;

YOU THINK SO? THEN TAKE THE UNIVERSE AND GRIND IT DOWN TO THE FINEST POWDER AND SIEVE IT THROUGH THE FINEST SIEVE AND THEN &lt;i&gt;SHOW&lt;/i&gt; ME ONE ATOM OF JUSTICE, ONE MOLECULE OF MERCY. AND YET—Death waved a hand. AND YET YOU ACT AS IF THERE IS SOME IDEAL ORDER IN THE WORLD, AS IF THERE IS SOME...SOME &lt;i&gt;RIGHTNESS&lt;/i&gt; IN THE UNIVERSE BY WHICH IT MAY BE JUDGED.

&quot;Yes, but people have &lt;i&gt;got&lt;/i&gt; to believe that, or what's the &lt;i&gt;point&lt;/i&gt;—&quot;

MY POINT EXACTLY." -- Terry Pratchett]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The reason that the rich were so rich, Vimes reasoned, was because they managed to spend less money.

Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.

But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.

This was the Captain Samuel Vimes 'Boots' theory of socioeconomic unfairness." -- Terry Pratchett]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The gods of the Disc have never bothered much about judging the souls of the dead, and so people only go to hell if that's where they believe, in their deepest heart, that they deserve to go. Which they won't do if they don't know about it. This explains why it is so important to shoot missionaries on sight." -- Terry Pratchett]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Whatever happens, they say afterwards, it must have been fate. People are always a little confused about this, as they are in the case of miracles. When someone is saved from certain death by a strange concatenation of circumstances, they say that's a miracle. But of course if someone is &lt;i&gt;killed&lt;/i&gt; by a freak chain of events -- the oil spilled just there, the safety fence broken just there -- that must also be a miracle. Just because it's not nice doesn't mean it's not miraculous." -- Terry Pratchett]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Do you know what it feels like to be aware of every star, every blade of grass? Yes. You do. You call it 'opening your eyes again.' But you do it for a moment. We have done it for eternity. No sleep, no rest, just endless... endless experience, endless awareness. Of everything. All the time. How we envy you, envy you! Lucky humans, who can close your minds to the endless deeps of space! You have this thing you call... boredom? That is the rarest talent in the universe! We heard a song — it went 'Twinkle twinkle little star....' What power! What wondrous power! You can take a billion trillion tons of flaming matter, a furnace of unimaginable strength, and turn it into a little song for children! You build little worlds, little stories, little shells around your minds, and that keeps infinity at bay and allows you to wake up in the morning without screaming!" -- Terry Pratchett]]>
