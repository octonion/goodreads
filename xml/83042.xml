		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I want men to admire me, but that's a trick you learn at school--a movement of the eyes, a tone of voice, a touch of the hand on the shoulder or the head. If they think you admire them, they will admire you because of your good taste, and when they admire you, you have an illusion for a moment that there's something to admire." -- Graham Greene]]>

	    <![CDATA["At the time I didn't realize their lie was a defense against the fear they had of losing their mother.
