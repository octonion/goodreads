	    <![CDATA["I often hear people say that they read to escape reality, but I believe that what theyâ€™re really doing is reading to find reason for hope, to find strength. While a bad book leaves readers with a sense of hopelessness and despair, a good novel, through stories of values realized, of wrongs righted, can bring to readers a connection to the wonder of life. A good novel shows how life can and ought to be lived. It not only entertains but energizes and uplifts readers." -- Terry Goodkind]]>
