&quot;Who, me?&quot; said Howl. &quot;I assure you, my friends, I am cone sold stober.&quot; He got up and stalked upstairs, feeling for the wall as if he thought it might escape him unless he kept in touch with it. His bedroom door did escape him." -- Diana Wynne Jones]]>

	    <![CDATA["No sight so sad as that of a naughty child,&quot; he began, &quot;especially a naughty little girl. Do you know where the wicked go after death?&quot;

&quot;They go to hell,&quot; was my ready and orthodox answer.

&quot;And what is hell? Can you tell me that?&quot;

&quot;A pit full of fire.&quot;

&quot;And should you like to fall into that pit, and to be burning there for ever?&quot;

&quot;No, sir.&quot;

&quot;What must you do to avoid it?&quot;

I deliberated a moment: my answer, when it did come was objectionable: &quot;I must keep in good health and not die." -- Charlotte Brontë]]>
