	    <![CDATA["People think a soul mate is your perfect fit, and that's what everyone wants. But a true soul mate is a mirror, the person who shows you everything that is holding you back, the person who brings you to your own attention so you can change your life.  

A true soul mate is probably the most important person you'll ever meet, because they tear down your walls and smack you awake.  But to live with a soul mate forever?  Nah. Too painful.  Soul mates, they come into your life just to reveal another layer of yourself to you, and then leave.  

A soul mates purpose is to shake you up, tear apart your ego a little bit, show you your obstacles and addictions, break your heart open so new light can get in, make you so desperate and out of control that you have to transform your life, then introduce you to your spiritual master..." -- Elizabeth Gilbert]]>

	    <![CDATA["Love is a wonderful gift. It's a present so precious words can barely begin to describe it.  Love is a feeling, the deepest and sweetest of all.  It's incredibly strong and amazingly gentle at the very same time.  It is a blessing that should be counted every day.  It is nourishment for the soul.  It is devotion, constantly letting each person know how supportive it's certainty can be. Love is a heart filled with affection for the most important person in your life. Love is looking at the special someone who makes your world go around and absolutely loving what you see. Love gives meaning to one's world and magic to a million hopes and dreams.  It makes the morning shine more brightly and each season seem like it's the nicest one anyone ever had. Love is an invaluable bond that enriches every good thing in life.  It gives each hug a tenderness, each heart a happiness, each spirit a steady lift.  Love is an invisible connection that is exquisitely felt by those who know the joy, feel the warmth, share the sweetness, and celebrate the gift! " -- Douglas Pagels]]>

	    <![CDATA["Do not waste the precious moments of this, your present reality, seeking to unveil all of life's secrets.  Those secrets are a secret for a reason.  Grant your God the benefit of the doubt.  Use your NOW moment for the Highest Purpose- the creation and the expression of WHO YOU REALLY ARE.  Decide who you are- who you want to be-and then do everything in your power to be that.

It is not nearly so important how well a message is received as how well it is sent.  You cannot take responsibility for how well another accepts your truth; you can only ensure how well it is communicated.  And by how well, I don't mean merely how clearly; I mean how lovingly, how compassionately, how sensitively, how courageously, and how completely.

If you think your life is about DOINGNESS, you do not understand what you are about.  Your soul doesn't care what you do for a living-and when your life is over, neither will you.  Your soul cares only about what you're BEING while you're doing whatever you're doing.  It is a state of BEINGNESS the soul is after, not a state of doingness." -- Neale Donald Walsch]]>
