	    <![CDATA["October—

You were sleeping so peacefully that I was loath to wake you. Duke Torquill, after demanding to know what I was doing in your apartment, has requested that I inform you of his intent to visit after ‘tending to some business at the Queen’s Court.’ I recommend wearing something clinging, as that may distract him from whatever he wishes to lecture you about this time. Hopefully, it’s your manners.

You are truly endearing when you sleep. I attribute this to the exotic nature of seeing you in a state of silence.

—Tybalt

	    <![CDATA["It's the oldest story in the world.  Boy loves girl.  Boy loses girl.  Boy gets girl back thanks to the unethical behavior of megalomaniacal mad scientists who never met a corpse they wouldn't try to resurrect.  Anyone coming within a hundred yards of my happy ending had better pray that they're immune to bullets.  - Shaun Mason" -- Mira Grant]]>
