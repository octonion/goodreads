	    <![CDATA["We the mortals touch the metals,
the wind, the ocean shores, the stones,
knowing they will go on, inert or burning,
and I was discovering, naming all the these things:
it was my destiny to love and say goodbye." -- Pablo Neruda]]>

	    <![CDATA["I studied Comparative Literature at Cornell. Structuralism was real big then. The idea of reading and writing as being this language game. There's a lot of appeal to that. It's nice to think of it as this playful kind of thing. But I think that another way to look at it is &quot;Look, I just want to be sincere. I want to write something and make you feel something and maybe you will go out and do something.&quot; And it seems that the world is in such bad shape now that we don't have time to do nothing but language games. That's how it seems to me." -- William T. Vollmann]]>
