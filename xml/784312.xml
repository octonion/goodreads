	    <![CDATA["An author is a person who can never take innocent pleasure in visiting a bookstore again.  Say you go in and discover that there are no copies of your book on the shelves.  You resent all the other books - I don't care if they are Great Expectations, Life on the Mississippi and the King James Bible that are on the shelves." -- Roy Blount Jr.]]>

	    <![CDATA["I finished my first book seventy-six years ago.  I offered it to every publisher on the English-speaking earth I had ever heard of.
