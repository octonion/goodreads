	    <![CDATA["To have that sense of one's intrinsic worth which constitutes self-respect is potentially to have everything: the ability to discriminate, to love and to remain indifferent. To lack it is to be locked within oneself, paradoxically incapable of either love or indifference." -- Joan Didion]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["We were keeping our eye on 1984. When the year came and the prophecy didn't, thoughtful Americans sang softly in praise of themselves. The roots of liberal democracy had held. Wherever else the terror had happened, we, at least, had not been visited by [author:Orwellian|3706] nightmares.

But we had forgotten that alongside [author:Orwell|3706]'s dark vision, there was another - slightly older, slightly less well known, equally chilling: [author:Aldous Huxley|3487]'s Brave New World. Contrary to common belief even among the educated, [author:Huxley|3487] and [author:Orwell|3706] did not prophesy the same thing. [author:Orwell|3706] warns that we will be overcome by an externally imposed oppression. But in [author:Huxley|3487]'s vision, no Big Brother is required to deprive people of their autonomy, maturity and history. As he saw it, people will come to love their oppression, to adore the technologies that undo their capacities to think.

What [author:Orwell|3706] feared were those who would ban books. What [author:Huxley|3487] feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one. [author:Orwell|3706] feared those who would deprive us of information. [author:Huxley|3487] feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egoism. [author:Orwell|3706] feared that the truth would be concealed from us. [author:Huxley|3487] feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance. [author:Orwell|3706] feared we would become a captive culture. [author:Huxley|3487] feared we would become a trivial culture, preoccupied with some equivalent of the feelies, the orgy porgy, and the centrifugal bumblepuppy. As [author:Huxley|3487] remarked in Brave New World Revisited, the civil libertarians and rationalists who are ever on the alert to oppose tyranny &quot;&lt;i&gt;failed to take into account man's almost infinite appetite for distractions&lt;/i&gt;.&quot; In 1984, [author:Orwell|3706] added, people are controlled by inflicting pain. In Brave New World, they are controlled by inflicting pleasure. In short, [author:Orwell|3706] feared that what we fear will ruin us. [author:Huxley|3487] feared that what we desire will ruin us.

This book is about the possibility that [author:Huxley|3487], not [author:Orwell|3706], was right." -- Neil Postman]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Is not this a true autumn day? Just the still melancholy that I love - that makes life and nature harmonise. The birds are consulting about their migrations, the trees are putting on the hectic or the pallid hues of decay, and begin to strew the ground, that one's very footsteps may not disturb the repose of earth and air, while they give us a scent that is a perfect anodyne to the restless spirit. Delicious autumn! My very soul is wedded to it, and if I were a bird I would fly about the earth seeking the successive autumns.&quot;

[&lt;i&gt;Letter to Miss Eliot&lt;/i&gt;, Oct. 1, 1841]" -- George Eliot]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["You expected to be sad in the fall. Part of you died each year when the leaves fell from the trees and their branches were bare against the wind and the cold, wintery light. But you knew there would always be the spring, as you knew the river would flow again after it was frozen. When the cold rains kept on and killed the spring, it was as though a young person died for no reason." -- Ernest Hemingway]]>

	    <![CDATA["My heart is drumming in my chest so hard it aches, but it's the good kind of ache, like the feeling you get on the first real day of autumn, when the air is crisp and the leaves are all flaring at the edges and the wind smells just vaguely of smoke - like the end and the beginning of something all at once." -- Lauren Oliver]]>

Containing depth within itself, darkness, something of the grave almost." -- Rainer Maria Rilke]]>

	    <![CDATA["The law presides over things of this world, finally. The world where shadow is shadow and light is light, yin is yin and yang is yang, I'm me and he's him. 'I am me and / He is him/ Autumn eve.' But you don't belong to that world, sonny. The world you belong to is above that or below that.&quot;

Which is better?&quot; I asked, out of simple curiosity. &quot;Above or below?&quot;

It's not that either one is better,&quot; he said. After a brief coughing fit, he spat a glob of phlegm onto a tissue and studied it closely before crumpling the tissue and throwing it into a wastebasket. &quot;It's not a question of better or worse. The point is, not to resist the flow. You go up when you're supposed to go up and down when you're supposed to go down. When you're supposed to go up, find the highest tower and climb to the top. When you're supposed to go down, find the deepest well and go down to the bottom. When there is no flow, stay still. If you resist the flow, everything dries up. If everything dries up, the world is darkness. 'I am he and/ He is me:/ Spring nightfall.' Abandon the self, and there you are." -- Haruki Murakami]]>

	    <![CDATA["Now youâ€™ve said it. The hopeless emptiness. Hell, plenty of people are on to the emptiness part; out where I used to work, on the Coast, thatâ€™s all we ever talked about. Weâ€™d sit around talking about emptiness all night. Nobody ever said â€˜hopeless,â€™ though; thatâ€™s where weâ€™d chicken out. Because maybe it does take a certain amount of guts to see the emptiness, but it takes a whole hell of a lot more to see the hopelessness. And I guess when you do see the hopelessness, thatâ€™s when thereâ€™s nothing to do but take off. If you can" -- Richard Yates]]>
