		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["It was generally agreed that a coffin-size studio on Avenue D was preferable to living in one of the boroughs. Moving from one Brooklyn or Staten Island neighborhood to another was fine, but unless you had children to think about, even the homeless saw it as a step down to leave Manhattan. Customers quitting the island for Astoria or Cobble Hill would claim to welcome the change of pace, saying it would be nice to finally have a garden or live a little closer to the airport. Theyâ€™d put a good face one it, but one could always detect an underlying sense of defeat. The apartments might be bigger and cheaper in other places, but one could never count on their old circle of friend making the long trip to attend a birthday party. Even Washington Heights was considered a stretch. People referred to it as Upstate New York, though it was right there in Manhattan." -- David Sedaris]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Chapter 1.
He adored New York City. He idolized it all out of proportion...&lt;i&gt;no, make that:&lt;/i&gt; he - he romanticized it all out of proportion. &lt;i&gt;Yes.&lt;/i&gt; To him, no matter what the season was, this was still a town that existed in black and white and pulsated to the great tunes of George Gershwin.'

&lt;i&gt;Uh, no let me start this over.&lt;/i&gt;

'Chapter 1.
He was too romantic about Manhattan, as he was about everything else. He thrived on the hustle bustle of the crowds and the traffic. To him, New York meant beautiful women and street-smart guys who seemed to know all the angles...'. 

&lt;i&gt;Ah, corny, too corny for my taste. Can we ... can we try and make it more profound?&lt;/i&gt;

'Chapter 1.
He adored New York City. For him, it was a metaphor for the decay of contemporary culture. The same lack of individual integrity that caused so many people to take the easy way out was rapidly turning the town of his dreams in...'

&lt;i&gt;No, that's a little bit too preachy. I mean, you know, let's face it, I want to sell some books here.&lt;/i&gt;

'Chapter 1.
He adored New York City, although to him it was a metaphor for the decay of contemporary culture. How hard it was to exist in a society desensitized by drugs, loud music, television, crime, garbage...'

&lt;i&gt;Too angry, I don't want to be angry.&lt;/i&gt;

'Chapter 1.
He was as tough and romantic as the city he loved. Behind his black-rimmed glasses was the coiled sexual power of a jungle cat.'

&lt;i&gt;I love this.&lt;/i&gt;

'New York was his town, and it always would be." -- Woody Allen]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I would give the greatest sunset in the world for one sight of New York's skyline. Particularly when one can't see the details. Just the shapes. The shapes and the thought that made them. The sky over New York and the will of man made visible. What other religion do we need? And then people tell me about pilgrimages to some dank pesthole in a jungle where they go to do homage to a crumbling temple, to a leering stone monster with a pot belly, created by some leprous savage. Is it beauty and genius they want to see? Do they seek a sense of the sublime? Let them come to New York, stand on the shore of the Hudson, look and kneel. When I see the city from my window - no, I don't feel how small I am - but I feel that if a war came to threaten this, I would throw myself into space, over the city, and protect these buildings with my body." -- Ayn Rand]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Of course, in Los Angeles, &lt;I&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt; is based on driving, even the killings. In New York, most people don't have cars, so if you want to kill a person, you have to take the subway to their house. And sometimes on the way, the train is delayed and you get impatient, so you have to kill someone on the subway. That's why there are so many subway murders; no one has a car." -- George Carlin]]>

	    <![CDATA["So I went to New York City to be born again.  It was and remains easy for most Americans to go somewhere else and start anew.  I wasn't like my parents.  I didn't have any supposedly sacred piece of land or shoals of friends to leave behind.  Nowhere has the number zero been of more philisophical value than in the United States.... and when the [train] plunged into a tunnel under New York City, with it's lining of pipes and wires, I was out of the womb and into the birth canal." -- Kurt Vonnegut]]>
