	    <![CDATA["What are you doing?&quot; 
&quot;Ya!&quot; said Jane, whirling around, her hands held up menacingly. 
It was Mr. Nobley with coat, hat, and cane, watching her with wide eyes. Jane took several quick (but oh so casual) steps away from Martin's window. 
&quot;Um, did I just say, 'Ya'?&quot; 
&quot;You just said 'Ya,'&quot; he confirmed. &quot;If I am not mistaken, it was a battle cry, warning that you were about to attack me.
I, uh...&quot; She stopped to laugh. &quot;I wasn't aware until this precise and awkward moment that when startled in a startled in a strange place, my instincts would have me pretend to be a ninja." -- Shannon Hale]]>

	    <![CDATA["There are others watching over you from the other side of the veil. We watch.  We listen.  And we understand.  We never leave your side, Azadeh.  Someone is always near, someone who knows you and loves you and wants you to succeed.  You are never alone.  There is always someone there.  Think of that, remember, and it will give you the strength that you need." -- Chris Stewart]]>
