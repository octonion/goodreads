	    <![CDATA["It is better to be alone, she figures, than to be with someone who can't see who you are.  It is better to lead than to follow.  It is better to speak up than stay silent.  It is better to open doors than to shut them on people.

She will not be simple and sweet.  She will not be what people tell her to be.  That Bunny Rabbit is dead." -- E. Lockhart]]>

	    <![CDATA["She might, in fact, go crazy, as has happened to a lot of people who break rules.  Not the people who play at rebellion but really only solidify their already dominant positions in society...but those who take some larger action that disrupts the social order.  Who try to push through the doors that are usually closed to them.  They do sometimes go crazy, these people, because the world is telling them not to want the things they want.  It can seem saner to give up--but then one goes insane from giving up." -- E. Lockhart]]>

	    <![CDATA["...a box where she was expected to be sweet and sensitive (but not oversensitive); a box for young and pretty girls who were not as bright or powerful as their boyfriends. A box for people who were not forces to be reckoned with." -- E. Lockhart]]>

	    <![CDATA["Frankie appreciated both the accolades and the rejections equally, because both meant she'd had an impact. She wasn't a person who needed to be liked so much as she was a person who liked to be notorious." -- E. Lockhart]]>
