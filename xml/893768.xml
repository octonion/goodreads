	    <![CDATA["They were stars on this stage, each playing to an audience of two: the passion of their pretense created the actuality.  Here, finally, was the quintessence of self-expression-- yet it was probable that for the most part their love expressed Gloria rather than Anthony.  He felt often like a scarecly tolerated guest at a party she was giving." -- Fitzgerald]]>

	    <![CDATA["When you visualized a man or a woman carefully, you could always begin to feel pity . . . that was a quality God's image carried with it . . . when you saw the lines at the corners of the eyes, the shape of the mouth, how the hair grew, it was impossible to hate. Hate was just a failure of imagination." -- Graham Greene]]>
