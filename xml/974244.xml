Renewed shall be blade that was broken,
The crownless again shall be king." -- J.R.R. Tolkien]]>

My friend Gregory knows a friend of the nephew of the inventor.&quot; &quot;What did people do before 1969?&quot; &quot;Merely blowjobs and masticating box, but never in chorus." -- Jonathan Safran Foer]]>

And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do." -- Apple Computer Inc.]]>
