		<description>
	    <![CDATA["People were buying milk, or filling their cars with petrol, or even posting letters. And what no one else knew was the appalling weight of the thing they were carrying inside. The superhuman effort it took sometimes to be normal, and a part of things that appeared both easy and everyday. The loneliness of that." -- Rachel Joyce]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Albert liked to play the stoic, and he embraced the opportunity to do over the negotiations about the marriage.  He insisted that Uncle Leopold know what a great sacrifice he was making for the Saxe-Coburg family and Germany.  As he gloomily lectured his uncle, 'troubles are inseparable from all human positions andâ€¦therefore if one must be subject to plagues and annoyances, it is better to be so for some great or worthy object than for trifles or miseries.'

Unfortunately for Albert, Leopold was deaf to self-pitying emotional blackmail and remained determined on his course." -- Kate Williams]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["WHEN I WAS LITTLE, I was so girlie and ambitious, I was practically a drag queen. I wanted to be everything at once: a prima ballerina, an actress, a model, a famous artist, a nurse, an Ice Capades dancer, and Batgirl. I spent inordinate amounts of time waltzing around our living room with a doily on my head, imagining in great detail my promenade down the runway as the new Miss America, during which time I would also happen to receive a Nobel Prize for coloring." -- Susan Jane Gilman]]>
