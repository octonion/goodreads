		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Eldric turned away from the mirror, holding out his hand. In the cup of his hand lay his fidget of paper clips. But the fidget had blossomed into a crown. An allover-filigree crown, with a twisty spire marking the front.
I stared at it for some moments. &quot;It's for you,&quot; said Eldric. &quot;If you want it.&quot;
&quot;I'm seventeen,&quot; I said. &quot;I haven't played at princess for years.&quot;
&quot;Does that matter ?&quot; Eldric set it on my head. It was almost weightless, a true crown for the steam age.
In a proper story, antagonistic sparks would fly between Eldric and me, sparks that would sweeten the inevitable kiss on page 324. But life doesn't work that way. I didn't hate Eldric, which, for me, is about as good as things get." -- Franny Billingsley]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Nobody tells her to shut up. It would be pointless. Amy has a large heart and an even larger mouth. When it rains, Amy rescues worms off the sidewalk. When you get tired of having a secret, you tell Amy.
Understand: Amy isn't that much stupider than anyone else in the story. It's just that she thinks out loud." -- Kelly Link]]>

	    <![CDATA["Forgive, I hope you won't be upset, but when I was a boy I used to look up and see you behind your desk, so near but far away, and, how can I say this, I used to think that you were Mrs. God, and that the library was a whole world, and that no matter what part of the world or what people or thing I wanted to see and read, you'd find and give it to me." -- Ray Bradbury]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["And in this doleful mood he ventured to wonder if they ever thought back to when things were just old-fangled or not fangled at all as against the modern day when fangled had reached its apogee. Fangling was indeed, he thought, here to stay. Then he wondered: had anyone ever thought of themselves as a fangler?" -- Terry Pratchett]]>
