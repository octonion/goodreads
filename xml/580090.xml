		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The disgraced Usurer Yankel D took the baby girl home that evening...  He made a bed of crumpled newspaper in a deep baking pan and gently tucked it in the oven, so that she wouldn't be disturbed by the noise of the small falls outside...  When he pulled her out to feed her or just hold her, her body was tattooed with the newsprint...  Sometimes he would rock her to sleep in his arms, and read her left to right, and know everything he needed to know about the world.  If it wasn't written on her, it wasn't important to him." -- Jonathan Safran Foer]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["And I envied her that she had chosen her work herself and was doing what she wanted to do.  I don't suppose I had any idea what I 'wanted' and so I was chosen, not choosing.  There's glory and honor in being chosen.  But not much room for free will." -- Elizabeth Wein]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I have an idea that the only thing which makes it possible to regard this world we live in without disgust is the beauty which now and then men create out of the chaos. The pictures they paint, the music they compose, the books they write, and the lives they lead. Of all these the richest in beauty is the beautiful life. That is the perfect work of art." -- W. Somerset Maugham]]>
