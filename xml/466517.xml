	    <![CDATA["If we wished to gain contentment, we might try such rules as these: 
1.  Allow thyself to complain of nothing, not even of the weather. 
2.  Never picture thyself to thyself under any circumstances in which thou art not. 
3.  Never compare thine own lot with that of another. 
4.  Never allow thyself to dwell on the wish that this or that had been, or were, otherwise than it was, or is.  God Almighty loves thee better and more wisely than thou dost thyself. 
5.  Never dwell on the morrow.  Remember that it is God's, not thine.  The heaviest part of sorrow often is to look forward to it.  &quot;The Lord will provide." -- Edward Bouverie Pusey]]>

	    <![CDATA["Make careful choice of the books which you read: 
let the holy Scriptures ever have the preeminence. 
Let Scripture be first and most in your hearts and 
hands and other books be used as subservient to it. 

While reading ask yourself: 

1. Could I spend this time no better? 

2. Are there better books that would edify me more? 

3. Are the lovers of such a book as this the greatest 
    lovers of the Book of God and of a holy life? 

4. Does this book increase my love to the Word of God, 
    kill my sin, and prepare me for the life to come? 

&quot;The words of the wise are like goads, their collected 
 sayings like firmly embedded nailsâ€”given by one Shepherd.
 Be warned, my son, of anything in addition to them. Of
 making many books there is no end, and much study
 wearies the body.&quot; Ecclesiastes 12:11-12" -- Richard Baxter]]>
