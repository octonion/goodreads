	    <![CDATA["I was trying to come round to the idea that there might be an invisible reality capable of interfering in our lives, but the only reason I did so was because of a love I didn't want to believe I felt but which was continuing to grow in a subtle, devastating way. 

I was content in my universe and didn't want to change it at all, even though I was being propelled in that direction." -- Paulo Coelho]]>
