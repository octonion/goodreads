	    <![CDATA["Thad asked, &quot;Why does she keep calling you Kid, Mr.Morgan? Something about that sounds mite familiar.&quot;

&quot;Son of a gun!&quot; Bill suddenly exclaimed. &quot;He's Kid Morgan, the gunfighter! I've read about him!

Lace glanced at The Kid and smiled. &quot;Looks like your secret's out.&quot;

&quot;It was never that much of a secret.&quot; The Kid shrugged.

&quot;Well, I'm glad I don't have to keep it anymore,&quot; Nick said.

The Gustaffson brothers looked at him. Bill said, &quot;You knew about this?&quot; 

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Nick replied, looking a little ashamed. &quot;I'm sorry, fellas. Mr.Morgan asked me to keep quiet about it, and I promised him I would." -- J.A. Johnstone]]>
