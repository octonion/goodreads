	    <![CDATA["He put the knuckles of his fist to the table, leaned toward Niles and spoke quietly, cuttingly, in his rough, gravelly voice.

“Fucked her last night, man, and this morning. Five times. Five. It was like she hadn’t been touched in a decade. So fuckin’ sweet. Damn,” he taunted, his eyes locked on Niles. “You’ve had her, you gotta know, not enough money in the world’s worth that." -- Kristen Ashley]]>

She was a week away from me, she walked into a room I was in holdin’ another man’s hand, I’d lose my fuckin’ mind. Not at her. Wonderin’ where I lost my way and I’d talk to her about how to find my way back." -- Kristen Ashley]]>

	    <![CDATA["It isn't that it's too soon, you're on the back of my bike, it ain't too soon. You can buy sheets. You cannot install blinds.&quot; 
&quot;um...&quot; I mumbled. &quot;Can you explain the difference?&quot; 
&quot;Sheets are chick territory,&quot; he said without delay. &quot;You gotta use tools, that's dick territory.&quot; 
&quot;Oh,&quot; I whispered. 
&quot;Don't tread on dick territory,&quot; he advised. 
&quot;So, um... is a paintbrush a tool?&quot; I asked cautiously. 
&quot;If you're paintin' the side of the house, yeah. If you're painting mud colored paint in a room, no.&quot; 
&quot;It's terracotta,&quot; I said softly. 
&quot;Whatever,&quot; he muttered, his mouth twitching. 
&quot;Or, the paint chip called it Mexican horizon. The blue is dawn sky.&quot; 
&quot;Definitely chick territory,&quot; Tate replied, losing the fight with his grin. 
&quot;What about...pictures for the walls?&quot; I asked. 
&quot;Chick,&quot; he answered instantly. 
&quot;Um...could I ask that, instead of you getting angry and being a jerk, maybe you give me a head's up when I'm doing something stupid?" -- Kristen Ashley]]>

	    <![CDATA["Whoever said that love hurts was wrong. Love is excruciating, especially when you can feel it slipping through your fingers and there is nothing you can do about it.

Not because he was perfect, or because you were, but because your combined flaws were arranged in a way that allowed two separate beings to hinge together." -- Lisa Kleypas]]>

This is the kind of thing you see if you sit in the darkness with open eyes, not knowing the future." -- Margaret Atwood]]>
