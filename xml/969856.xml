		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I'm coming back into focus when Caesar asks him if he has a girlfriend back home. Peeta hesitates, then gives an unconvincing shake of his head.

Handsome lad like you. There must be some special girl. Come on, what’s her name?&quot; says Caesar.

Peeta sighs. &quot;Well, there is this one girl. I’ve had a crush on her ever since I can remember. But I’m pretty sure she didn’t know I was alive until the reaping.&quot;

Sounds of sympathy from the crowd. Unrequited love they can relate to.

She have another fellow?&quot; asks Caesar.

I don’t know, but a lot of boys like her,&quot; says Peeta.

So, here’s what you do. You win, you go home. She can’t turn you down then, eh?&quot; says Caesar encouragingly.

I don’t think it’s going to work out. Winning...won’t help in my case,&quot; says Peeta.

Why ever not?&quot; says Caesar, mystified.

Peeta blushes beet red and stammers out. &quot;Because...because...she came here with me." -- Suzanne Collins]]>

Stubbornly he shook his head. &quot;No, I know that I have to be with you.  Everything else is just .... details." -- S.C. Stephens]]>

	    <![CDATA["You can’t tell me
what to do anymore, Travis! I don’t belong to you!”
In the second it took him to turn and face me, his
expression had contorted into anger. He stomped toward
me, planting his hands on the bed and leaning into my face.
“WELL I BELONG TO YOU!” The veins in his neck
bulged as he shouted, and I met his glare, refusing to even
flinch. He looked at my lips, panting. “I belong to you." -- Jamie McGuire]]>

	    <![CDATA["Speaking of tongues, they are the main reason I'm a nervous wreck. Ryan is a senior and well, sadly, I'm not all that experienced with boys. I mean, I'm a freshman and have been to dances with boys my age and even have gone out with boys, but I've never really kissed them. Not like I hope to kiss Ryan anyway. Bobby Robinson did shove his tongue into my mouth one time, when we were kissing under the bleachers at a football game, but it didn't feel so good. I'm pretty sure he didn't have it exactly right. So I talked to my friends, Katie and Lisa, about how to properly make out. But, well, here is just a bit of their unhelpful advice.
Just let him take the lead, do what ever he does.
Um, couldn't that get me into a lot of trouble?
Just sort of kiss his tongue, but try not to drool.
Don't open your mouth too wide.
And then, just open your mouth wide.
See?
Stupid, conflicting information.
And this from girls who supposedly know how to do this!
I feel like I'm an undercover CIA agent trying to wrestle vital information out of a ruthless double agent, and the fate of the free world depends upon it. All the while, the President is yelling at me in a panic, saying, Somebody! Anybody! Just get me the truth!" -- Jillian Dodd]]>
