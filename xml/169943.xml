	    <![CDATA["On Undecided Voter​s: &quot;To put them in perspective, I think​ of being​ on an airplane.​ The flight attendant comes​ down the aisle​ with her food cart and, eventually,​ parks​ it beside my seat.​ “Can I inter​est you in the chick​en?​” she asks.​ “Or would​ you prefer the platter of shit with bits of broke​n glass​ in it?”

To be undecided in this elect​ion is to pause​ for a moment and then ask how the chick​en is cooked." -- David Sedaris]]>

	    <![CDATA["The italian nanny was attempting to answer the teachers latest question when the moroccan student interupted, shouting &quot;Excuse me, What is an easter?&quot;
it would seem that depsite having grown up in a muslim country, she would have heard it mentioned once or twice, but no. &quot;I mean it,&quot; She said. &quot; I have no idea what you people are talking about.&quot;
The teacher called upon the rest of us to explain.
The poles led the charge to the best of their ability. It is,&quot; said one, &quot;a party for the little boy of god who call his self jesus and... oh shit.&quot; She faltered and her fellow country man came to her aid.
He call his self Jesus and then he die one day on two... morsels of... lumber.&quot;
The rest of the class jumped in, offering bits of information that would have given the pope an aneurysm.
he die one day and then he go above of my head to live with your father.&quot;
he weared of himself the long hair and after he die. the first day he come back here for to say hello to the peoples.&quot;
he Nice the jesus.&quot;
 he make the good things, and on the easter we be sad because somebody makes him dead today." -- David Sedaris]]>

	    <![CDATA["Listen, you might want to pack a few of your things together before going to bed. The former bishop of Turkey will be coming tonight along with six to eight black men. They might put some candy in your shoes, they might stuff you into a sack and take you to Spain, or they might just pretend to kick you. We don't know for sure, but we want you to be prepared.&quot; 
This was the reward for living in the Netherlands. As a child you get to hear this story, and as an adult you get to turn around and repeat it." -- David Sedaris]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["States vote to take away my marriage rights, and even though I don't want to get married, it tends to hurt my feelings. I guess what bugs me is that it was put to a vote in the first place. If you don't want to marry a homosexual, then don't. But what gives you the right to weigh in on your neighbor's options? It's like voting whether or not redheads should be allowed to celebrate Christmas." -- David Sedaris]]>
