	    <![CDATA["He was the crazy one who had painted himself black and defeated the world.

She was the book thief without the words.

Trust me, though, the words were on their way, and when they arrived, Liesel would hold them in her hands like the clouds, and she would wring them out like rain." -- Markus Zusak]]>

	    <![CDATA["We come unbidden into this life, and if we are lucky we find a purpose beyond starvation, misery, and early death which, lest we forget, is the common lot.  I grew up and I found my purpose and it was to become a physician.  My intent wasn't to save the world as much as to heal myself.  Few doctors will admit this, certainly not young ones, but subconsciously, in entering the profession, we must believe that ministering to others will heal our woundedness.  And it can.  but it can also deepen the wound." -- Abraham Verghese]]>

	    <![CDATA["I suddenly realized.  The zebra.  It is not something outside of us.  The zebra is something inside of us.  Our fears.  Our own self-destructive nature.  The zebra is the worst part of us when we are face-to-face with our worst times.  The demon is us!" -- Garth Stein]]>
