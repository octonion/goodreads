		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["If he or she really goes about it in earnest, anyone can cultivate ability in ten years, I believe.  Even in one year, shortcomings can be changed into good points if only we set our aims high enough.  Continuing for ten years, we can become outstanding indeed...There is no limit to our shortcomings.  Until we die, we should spare no time or effort in changing our weaknesses to merits.  To do so can be pleasant and interesting.  We can become like the horse that starts last and yet outruns the field, reaching the wire first; it is the same fun." -- Shinichi Suzuki]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["To make a resolution and act accordingly is to live with hope.  There may be difficulties and hardships, but not disappointment or despair if you follow the path steadily.  Do not hurry.  This is a fundamental rule.  If you hurry and collapse or tumble down, nothing is achieved.  DO not rest in your efforts; this is another fundamental rule.  Without stopping, without haste, carefully taking a step at a time forward will surely get you there." -- Shinichi Suzuki]]>

	    <![CDATA["Anything you think of doing, however insignificant, should be done immediately. Spur yourself on and carry it through without becoming discouraged. If this becomes an ingrained habit, things you thought were impossible will become possible, and closed doors will open, as you will discover in many ways." -- Shinichi Suzuki]]>
