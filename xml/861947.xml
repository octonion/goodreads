	    <![CDATA["We don’t need a list of rights and wrongs, tables of dos and don’ts: we need books, time, and silence. &lt;I&gt;Thou shalt not&lt;/I&gt; is soon forgotten, but &lt;I&gt;Once upon a time&lt;/I&gt; lasts forever." -- Philip Pullman]]>

	    <![CDATA["There's a hunger for stories in all of us, adults too. We need stories so much that we're even willing to read bad books to get them, if the good books won't supply them." -- Philip Pullman]]>

	    <![CDATA["...But it gradually seemed to me that I'd made myself believe something that wasn't true. I'd made myself believe that I was fine and happy and fulfilled on my own without the love of anyone else. Being in love was like China: you knew it was there, and no doubt it was very interesting, and some people went there, but I never would. I'd spend all my life without ever going to China, but it wouldn't matter, because there was all the rest of the world to visit... And I thought: am I really going to spend the rest of my life without feeling that again? I thought: I &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; to go to China. It's full of treasures and strangeness and mysteries and joy." -- Philip Pullman]]>
