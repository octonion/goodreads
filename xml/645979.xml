	    <![CDATA["Here comes the sun, here comes the sun 
And I say it's all right 
Little darlin' it's been a long cold lonely winter 
Little darlin' it feels like years since it's been here 
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun 
And I say it's all right 
Little darlin' the smiles returning to their faces 
Little darlin' it seems like years since it's been here 
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun 
And I say it's all right 
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes 
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes 
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes 
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes 
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes 
Little darlin' I feel the ice is slowly meltin' 
Little darlin' it seems like years since it's been clear 
Here come the sun, here comes the sun 
And I say it's all right 
Here come the sun, here comes the sun 
It's all right, it's all right" -- George Harrison]]>
