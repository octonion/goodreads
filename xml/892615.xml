	    <![CDATA["The regime had understood that one person leaving her house while asking herself: 
Are my trousers long enough?'
Is my veil in place?' 
Can my make-up be seen?' 
Are they going to whip me?' 

No longer asks herself: 

Where is my freedom of thought?' 
Where is my freedom of speech?' 
My life, is it livable?'
What's going on in the political prisons?" -- Marjane Satrapi]]>

	    <![CDATA["The earth isn’t spinning because you told it to do so. Your intestines aren’t digesting by your command. You’re made up of a trillion cells who don’t ask your permission before offering their rakats. And we think submission is applying strict discipline to our worship? We think surrender is about not eating a pig? It’s just not that small to me. i can’t fit my deen into a neat little box, because to me everything comes from Allah. Birds sing Allah’s name. to say Allah is in this book and not that… do you know who you’re talking about? the Allah that made you from a clot and clothed in flesh… Allah is too big and open for my deen to be small and closed." -- Michael Muhammad Knight]]>
