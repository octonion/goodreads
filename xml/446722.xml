	    <![CDATA["I caught a glimpse of my face in the mirror as we glided p. I looked as eroded as the groaning lift. What had happened to the fresh-faced belle from Boston, Mass.? The woman who stared back at me was at the dreaded age between forty-five and fifty, that no-man's land of sag, oncoming wrinkle, and stealthy approach of menopause.
&quot;I hate this elevator, too,&quot; I said grimly.
Zoe grinned and pinched my cheek.
&quot;Mom, even Gwyneth Paltrow would look like hell in that mirror.&quot;
I had to smile. That was such a Zoe-like remark." -- Tatiana de Rosnay]]>
