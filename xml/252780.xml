	    <![CDATA["She leaned down and looked at his lifeless face and Leisel kissed her best friend, Rudy Steiner, soft and true on his lips. He tasted dusty and sweet. He tasted like regret in the shadows of trees and in the glow of the anarchist's suit collection. She kissed him long and soft, and when she pulled herself away, she touched his mouth with her fingers...She did not say goodbye. She was incapable, and after a few more minutes at his side, she was able to tear herself from the ground. It amazes me what humans can do, even when streams are flowing down their faces and they stagger on..." -- Markus Zusak]]>

	    <![CDATA["How about a kiss, &lt;i&gt;Saumensch&lt;/i&gt;?&quot;

He stood waist-deep in the water for a few moments longer before climbing out and handing her the book. His pants clung to him, and he did not stop walking. In truth, I think he was afraid. Rudy Steiner was scared of the book thief's kiss. He must have longed for it so much. He must have loved her so incredibly hard. So hard that he would never ask for her lips again and would go to his grave without them." -- Markus Zusak]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Possibly the only good to come out of these nightmares was that it brought Hans Hubermann, her new papa, into the room, to soothe her, to love her.  

He came every night and sat with her.  The first couple of times, he simply stayed - a stranger to kill the aloneness.  A few nights after that, he whispered, &quot;Shhh, I'm here, it's all right.&quot;  After three weeks he held her.  Trust was accumulated quickly, due primarily to the brute strength of the man's gentleness, his thereness.  The girl knew from the outset that Hans Hubermann would always appear midscream, and he would not leave. (36)" -- Markus Zusak]]>

I want to ask him about that girl and if he loved her and still misses her.

	    <![CDATA["Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do." -- Apple Computer Inc.]]>
