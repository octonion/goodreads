		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Do you know when they say soul-mates? Everybody uses it in personal ads. &quot;Soul-mate wanted&quot;. It doesn't mean too much now. But soul mates- think about it. When your soul-whatever that is anyway-something so alive when you make music or love and so mysteriously hidden most of the rest of the time, so colorful and big but without color or shape-when your soul finds another soul it can recognize even before the rest of you knows about it. The rest of you just feels sweaty and jumpy at first. And your souls get married without even meaning to-even if you can't be together for some reason in real life, your souls just go ahead and make the wedding plans. A soul's wedding must be too beautiful to even look at. It must be blinding. In must be like all the weddings in the world-gondolas with canopies of doves, champagne glasses shattering, wings of veils, drums beating, flutes and trumpets,showers of roses. And after that happens-that's it, this is it. But sometimes you have to let that person go. When you are little, people , movie and fairy tales all tell you that one day you're going to meet this person.  So you keep waiting and it's a lot harder than they make it sound.  Then you meet and you think, okay, now we can just get on with it but you find out that sometimes your sould brother partner lover has other ideas about that.  " -- Francesca Lia Block]]>

Then my troubled heart is brightened,
As in sunshine gleam the ripples
That the cold wind makes in rivers." -- Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["My soul was a burden, bruised and bleeding.  It was tired of the man who carried it, but I found no place to set it down to rest.  Neither the charm of the countryside nor the sweet scents of a garden could soothe it.  It found no peace in song or laugher, none in the company of friends at table or in the pleasures of love, none even in books or poetry... Where could my heart find refuge from itself?  Where could I go, yet leave myself behind?" -- Wally Lamb]]>
