	    <![CDATA["My default answer to everything is no. As soon as I hear the inflection of inquiry in your voice, the word no forms in my mind, sometimes accompanies by a reason, often not.  Can I open the mail? No. Can I wear your necklace? No. When is dinner? No. What you probably wouldn't believe is how much I want to say yes.  Yes, you can take two dozen books home from the library. Yes, you can eat the whole roll of SweeTarts. Yes, you can camp out on the deck.  But the books will get lost, and SweeTarts will eventually make your tongue bleed, and if you sleep on the deck, the neighborhood racoons will nibble on you.  I often wish I could come back to life as your uncle, so I could give you more.  But, when you're the mom, your whole life is holding the rope against those wily secret agents who never, ever stop trying to get you to drop your end." -- Kelly Corrigan]]>
