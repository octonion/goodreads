		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I have always found the times when another person recognizes you to be strangely sad; I suspect the pathos of these moments is their rareness, the way they contrast with most daily encounters.  That reminder that it can be different, that you need not go through your life unknown but that you probably still will--that is the part that's almost unbearable." -- Curtis Sittenfeld]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The interest I felt in certain guys then confused me, because it wasn't romantic, but I wasn't sure what else it might be. But now I know: I wanted to take up people's time making jokes, to tease the dean in front of the entire school, to call him by a nickname. What I wanted was to be a cocky high-school boy, so fucking sure of my place in the world." -- Curtis Sittenfeld]]>

	    <![CDATA["The past does not haunt us.  We haunt the past.  We allow our minds to focus in that direction.  We open memories and examine them.  We reexperience emotions we felt during the painful events we experienced because we are recalling them in as much detail as we can." -- Augusten Burroughs]]>
