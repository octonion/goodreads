	    <![CDATA["It was, he thought, the difference between being dragged into the arena to face a battle to the death and walking into the arena with your head held high. Some people, perhaps, would say that there was little to choose between the two ways, but Dumbledore knew - and so do I, thought Harry, with a rush of fierce pride, and so did my parents - that there was all the difference in the world." -- J.K.

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["There was a clatter as the basilisk fangs cascaded out of Hermione's arms. Running at Ron, she flung them around his neck and kissed him full on the mouth. Ron threw away the fangs and broomstick he was holding and responded with such enthusiasm that he lifted Hermione off her feet. 
&quot;Is this the moment?&quot; Harry asked weakly, and when nothing happened except that Ron and Hermione gripped each other still more firmly and swayed on the spot, he raised his voice. &quot;OI! There's a war going on here!&quot; 
Ron and Hermione broke apart, their arms still around each other. 
&quot;I know, mate,&quot; said Ron, who looked as though he had recently been hit on the back of the head with a Bludger, &quot;so it's now or never, isn't it?&quot; 
&quot;Never mind that, what about the Horcrux?&quot; Harry shouted. &quot;D'you think you could just --- just hold it in, until we've got the diadem?&quot; 
&quot;Yeah --- right --- sorry ---&quot; said Ron, and he and Hermione set about gathering up fangs, both pink in the face." -- J.K. Rowling]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["And Harry saw very clearly as he sat there under the hot sun how people who cared about him had stood in front of him one by one, his mother, his father, his godfather, and finally Dumbledore, all determined to protect him; but now that was over. He could not let anybody else stand between him and Voldemort; he must abandon forever the illusion he ought to have lost at the age of one, that the shelter of a parent’s arms meant that nothing could hurt him. There was no waking from this nightmare, no comforting whisper in the dark that he was safe really, that it was all in his imagination; the last and greatest of his protectors had died, and he was more alone than he had ever been." -- J.K. Rowling]]>

	    <![CDATA["For instance, this new idea that You-Know-Who can kill with a single glance from his eyes. That’s a basilisk, listeners. One simple test: Check whether the thing that’s glaring at you has got legs. If it has, it’s safe to look into its eyes, although if it really is You-Know-Who, that’s still likely to be the last thing you ever do." -- J.K. Rowling]]>

&quot;You do care,&quot; said Dumbledore. He had not flinched or made a single move to stop Harry demolishing his office. His expression was calm, almost detached. &quot;You care so much you feel as though you will bleed to death with the pain of it." -- J.K. Rowling]]>
