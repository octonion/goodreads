	    <![CDATA["A prickle of awareness made the hairs at the back of his neck stand. A deep chill sank into his flesh to settle around his heart, squeezing it. Skeletal fingers scraped along his spine and he wanted to look back over his shoulder, but couldn’t. No, he didn’t dare. If he saw what caused the sound it might be more than he could handle. Rooted to the ground, he couldn’t twitch a finger or twist his head around. His lips glued together, so he couldn’t speak." -- Pamela K. Kinney, &quot;Let Demon Dogs Lie,&quot; Southern Haunts: Devils in the Darkness]]>

	    <![CDATA["A black dog, tall and wide as a full grown man, took a couple of steps toward them. It bared sharp, yellow fangs big as Bowie knifes. Drool dripped from them to the dried grass below. Unable to help it, Lee wet his pants when he saw the animal’s eyes. It had four glowing orbs that burned with a smoldering red light like the fires of Hell." -- Pamela K. Kinney, &quot;Let Demon Dogs Lie,&quot; Southern Haunts: Devils in the Darkness]]>
