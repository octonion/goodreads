		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The smile that covered a &quot;multitude of pains&quot; was no hypocritical mask. She was trying to hide her sufferings - even from God! - so as not to make others, especially the poor, suffer because of them. When she promised to do &quot;a little extra praying &amp; smiling&quot; for one of her friends, she was alluding to an acutely painful and costly sacrifice: to pray when prayer was so difficult and to smile when her interior pain was agonizing." -- Brian Kolodiejchuk]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["To commit herself to becoming &quot;an apostle of Joy&quot; when humanly speaking she might have felt at the brink of despair, was heroic indeed. She could do so because her joy was rooted in the certitude of the ultimate goodness of God's loving plan for her. And though her faith in this truth did not touch her soul with consolation, she ventured to meet the challenges of life with a smile. Her one lever was her blind trust in God." -- Brian Kolodiejchuk]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["There is so much deep contradiction in my soul. Such deep longing for God - so deep that it is painful - a suffering continual - and yet not wanted by God - repulsed - empty - no faith - no love - no zeal. Souls hold no attraction - Heaven means nothing - to me it looks like an empty place - the thought of it means nothing to me and yet this torturing longing for God. Pray for me please that I keep smiling at Him in spite of everything. For I am only His - so He has every right over me. I am perfectly happy to be nobody even to God. . . .

Your devoted child in J.C.
M. Teresa" -- Brian Kolodiejchuk]]>

	    <![CDATA["The burning zeal....that had led her to India had apparently vanished. At the same time....she clung steadfastly to the faith she professed, and without a drop of consolation, labored wholeheartedly in her daily service....of the poor." -- Brian Kolodiejchuk]]>
