	    <![CDATA["The pause makes you think the song will end.  And then the song isn't really over, so you're relieved.  But then the song does actually end, because every song ends, obviously, and THAT. TIME. THE. END. IS. FOR. REAL." -- Jennifer Egan]]>

	    <![CDATA["Rebecca was an academic star. Her new book was on the phenomenon of word casings, a term she'd invented for words that no longer had meaning outside quotation marks. English was full of these empty words--&quot;friend&quot; and &quot;real&quot; and &quot;story&quot; and &quot;change&quot;--words that had been shucked of their meanings and reduced to husks. Some, like &quot;identity&quot; and &quot;search&quot; and &quot;cloud,&quot; had clearly been drained of life by their Web usage. With others, the reasons were more complex; how had &quot;American&quot; become an ironic term? How had &quot;democracy&quot; come to be used in an arch, mocking way?" -- Jennifer Egan]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I felt no shame in these activities, because I understood what almost no one else seemed to grasp: that there was only an infinitesimal difference, a difference so small that it barely existed except as a figment of the human imagination, between working in a tall green glass building on Park Avenue and collecting litter in a park. In fact, there may have been no difference at all." -- Jennifer Egan]]>
