	    <![CDATA["Think of yourselves as a hand. Each of you is a finger, and without the others you're useless. Alone, a finger can't grasp, or control, or form a fist. You are nothing on your own, and everything together." -- Karen Traviss]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I burst out crying because I realized something right then and there: death was going to take her someday. Because she'd grow old and wrinkly, you see, and fill up with pain until it extinguished her, and it just ... seemed intolerable. Shouldn't it? I mean, even a diamond is forever, and a diamond can't grip your finger." -- Wil McCarthy]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Love is sublime, truly, a precious gift. But also, alas, one of God's little pranks. It's naive of you to confuse love with happiness, as if they were somehow the samae thing. In fact love, once found, is more akin to gravity: too strong, too close, and it will crush you.  Unless you're careful, always." -- Wil McCarthy]]>

	    <![CDATA["But pain... seems to me an insufficient reason not to embrace life. Being dead is quite painless. Pain, like time, is going to come on regardless. Question is, what glorious moments can you win from life in addition to the pain?" -- Lois McMaster Bujold]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["We do this thing. We open our hearts to the world around us. And the more we do that, the more we allow ourselves to love, the more we are bound to find ourselves one day - like Dave, and Morley, and Sam, and Stephanie - standing in the kitchen of our live, surrounded by the ones we love, and feeling empty, and alone, and sad, and lost for words, because one of our loved ones, who should be there, is missing. Mother or father, brother or sister, wife or husband, or a dog or cat. It doesn't really matter. After a while, each death feels like all the deaths, and you stand there like eveyone else has stood there before you, while the big wind of sadness blows around and through you. 
&quot;He was a great dog,&quot; said Dave.
&quot;Yes,&quot; said Morley. &quot;He was a great dog." -- Stuart McLean]]>

	    <![CDATA["Many Canadian nationalists harbour the bizarre fear that should we ever reject royalty, we would instantly mutate into Americans, as though the Canadian sense of self is so frail and delicate a bud, that the only thing stopping it from being swallowed whole by the US is an English lady in a funny hat." -- Will Ferguson]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Any man can be kind when he is comfortable. I'd always thought kindness a trivial virtue therefore. But when we were hungry, thirsty, sick, frightened, with our deaths shouting at us, in the heart of horror, you were still as unfailingly courteous as a gentleman at his ease before his own hearth.'&lt;br&gt; 
  'Events may be horrible or inescapable. Men have always a choice - if not whether, then how they may endure.' &lt;br&gt;
 -Bergon and Cazaril talking over the past" -- Lois McMaster Bujold]]>
