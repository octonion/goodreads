	    <![CDATA["It's a strange thing.  I hardly find anybody today who doesn't agree that the ledger should not determine how we live.  Most people think it's terrible that the pollution in Lake Michigan is being decided by how much it'll cost companies to cure it.  People are realizing that an environment is being created that will be as dangerous for capitalists to live in as well as for the working people...that it's insane to let major things be decided on the basis of black figures and red figures. I find temperate people saying today that the business-motivated system isn't a safe thing to have around." -- Fred W. Thompson]]>

	    <![CDATA["That's just pain she said.  It goes eventually.  And when it's gone, there's no lasting memory.  Not the worst of it  anyway.  It fades.  Our minds aren't made to hold on to the particulars of pain the way we do bliss.  It's a gift God gives us, a sign of His care for us." -- Charles Frazier]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["It bothers them that instead of taking on the role of abandoned lover, I have become a happy wife.  They relish seeing strong women like you and me humiliated.  They cannot forgive us that we triumphed where so many others fail...Courage is a virtue appreciated in a male but considered a defect in our gender.  Bold women are a threat to a world that is out of balance, in favor of men.  That is why they work so hard to mistreat and destroy us." -- Isabel Allende]]>

	    <![CDATA["Humanists try to behave decently and honorably without any expectation of rewards or punishments in an afterlife.  And, since the creator of the universe is to them unknowable so far, they serve as best they can the highest abstraction of which they have some understanding, which is their community." -- Kurt Vonnegut in a speech given in Portland OR to the American Humanist Association]]>
