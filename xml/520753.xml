	    <![CDATA["since feeling is first
who pays any attention
to the syntax of things
will never wholly kiss you;

wholly to be a fool
while Spring is in the world

my blood approves,
and kisses are a far better fate
than wisdom
lady i swear by all flowers. Don't cry
--the best gesture of my brain is less than
your eyelids' flutter which says

we are for eachother: then
laugh, leaning back in my arms
for life's not a paragraph

And death i think is no parenthesis" -- E.E. Cummings]]>

	    <![CDATA["Sometimes we encounter men, even entire families, whose gross ignorance, unappealing mien or reckless habits make us wonder how their genes have survived the trials and tribulations of the ages. Yet we do well to remember that, should the world be plunged into nuclear holocaust, the principal candidate for survival is neither man, nor the great elephant, nor the swift stallion, nor the wily fox – it is the lowly cockroach." -- Richard de Nooy]]>

	    <![CDATA["Eating was a welcome distraction, not for us but for &lt;i&gt;them&lt;/i&gt;.  However the piles on the plates clashed (macaroni cheese sauce oozing orangely under the spinach salad), however sour the mixtures they made (runaway grapes rolling in the gravy!), our guests chewed to prove that their existence hadn't been diverted.  For the price of a quick casserole, they bribed us into agreeing that this was God's plan, life was going on.  Their cliches were breath mints: they wanted us to suck away to sweeten the bad taste our misfortune left in their mouths.  And so we did." -- Kirk Curnutt]]>
