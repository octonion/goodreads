	    <![CDATA["Alex snorted as he packed the wound with sticky rice.

&quot;Is that stuff sterile?&quot; Ted asked, staring at Alex.

&quot;They boil it, don't they?&quot; Alex said, not looking up from what he was doing.

Ted's frown deepened.  &quot;That doesn't seem like enough.&quot;

&quot;Trust me.&quot;  Alex looked up now and smiled a little.  His voice altered just a little bit, not enough to be a full command voice, but enough to be way more persuasive than any normal person's voice.  &quot;It's an old wives' tale, but it works every time." -- Eileen Rendahl]]>
