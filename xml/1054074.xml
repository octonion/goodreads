	    <![CDATA["[D]on't ever apologize to an author for buying something in paperback, or taking it out from a library (that's what they're there for. Use your library). Don't apologize to this author for buying books second hand, or getting them from bookcrossing or borrowing a friend's copy. What's important to me is that people read the books and enjoy them, and that, at some point in there, the book was bought by someone. And that people who like things, tell other people.

	    <![CDATA["I don't believe in colleges and universities.  I believe in libraries because most students don't have any money.  When I graduated from high school, it was during the Depression and we had no money.  I couldn't go to college, so I went to the library three days a week for 10 years." -- Ray Bradbury]]>

	    <![CDATA["A library is a good place to go when you feel unhappy, for there, in a book, you may find encouragement and comfort. A library is a good place to go when you feel bewildered or undecided, for there, in a book, you may have your question answered. Books are good company, in sad times and happy times, for books are people - people who have managed to stay alive by hiding between the covers of a book.&quot;

[&lt;i&gt;Letters of Note&lt;/i&gt;; Troy (MI, USA) Public Library, 1971]" -- E.B. White]]>
