	    <![CDATA["I have observed, indeed, generally, that while in protestant countries the defections from the Platonic Christianity of the priests is to Deism, in catholic countries they are to Atheism. [author:Diderot|11004], [author:D'Alembert|3295333], [author:Dâ€™Holbach|1228712], [author:Condorcet|6420223], are known to have been among the most virtuous of men. Their virtue, then, must have had some other foundation than the love of God.

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and Constitutions. But laws and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind. As that becomes more developed, more enlightened, as new discoveries are made, new truths discovered and manners and opinions change, with the change of circumstances, institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times. We might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors." -- Thomas Jefferson]]>
