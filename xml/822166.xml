		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Our entire society is based on discontent.  People wanting more and more and more. Being constantly dissatisfied with their homes, their bodies, their décor, their clothes, everything – taking it for granted that that’s the whole point of life. Never to be satisfied. If you are perfectly happy with what you got, especially if what you got isn’t even all the spectacular then you’re dangerous. You’re breaking all the rules. You’re undermining the sacred economy. You’re challenging every assumption that society is built on." -- Tana French]]>

	    <![CDATA["I can't explain the alchemy that transmuted one evening into the equivalent of years held lightly in common. The only way I can put it is that we recognized, too surely even for surprise, that we shared the same currency." -- Tana French]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["People need a moral code, to help them make decisions.  All this bio-yogurt virtue and financial self-righteousness are just filling the gap in the market.  But the problem is that it's all backwards.  It's not that you do the right thing and hope it pays off; the morally right thing is by definition the thing that gives the biggest payoff." -- Tana French]]>
