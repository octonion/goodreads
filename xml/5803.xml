	    <![CDATA["In film, there are two ways of including human beings.  One is depicting human beings.  Another is to create a film form which, in itself, has all the qualities of being human:  tenderness, observation, fear, relaxation, the sense of stepping into the world and pulling back, expansion, contraction, changing, softening, tenderness of heart. The first is a form of theater and the latter is a form of poetry." -- Nathaniel Dorsky]]>

	    <![CDATA["You may not believe in magic but something very strange is happening at this very moment.  Your head has dissolved into thin air and I can see the rhododendrons through your stomach.  It's not that you are dead or anything dramatic like that, it is simply that you are fading away and I can't even remember your name." -- Leonora Carrington]]>
