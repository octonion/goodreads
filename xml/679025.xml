	    <![CDATA["She might, in fact, go crazy, as has happened to a lot of people who break rules.  Not the people who play at rebellion but really only solidify their already dominant positions in society...but those who take some larger action that disrupts the social order.  Who try to push through the doors that are usually closed to them.  They do sometimes go crazy, these people, because the world is telling them not to want the things they want.  It can seem saner to give up--but then one goes insane from giving up." -- E. Lockhart]]>
