	    <![CDATA["So, friends, every day do something that won't compute...Give your approval to all you cannot understand...Ask the questions that have no answers. Put your faith in two inches of humus that will build under the trees every thousand years...Laugh. Be joyful though you have considered all the facts....Practice resurrection." -- Wendell Berry]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Any nation that expects to be ignorant and free,&quot; Jefferson said, &quot;expects what never was and never will be.&quot; And if the gap between the educated and the uneducated in America continues to grow as it is in our time, as fast as or faster than the gap between the rich and the poor, the gap between the educated and the uneducated is going to be of greater consequence and the more serious threat to our way of life. We must not, by any means, misunderstand that." -- David McCullough]]>
