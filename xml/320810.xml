	    <![CDATA["If it's wild to your own heart, protect it.  Preserve it.  Love it. And fight for it, and dedicate yourself to it, whether it's a mountain range, your wife, your husband, or even (god forbid) your job.  It doesn't matter if it's wild to anyone else: if it's what makes your heart sing, if it's what makes your days soar like a hawk in the summertime, then focus on it.  Because for sure, it's wild, and if it's wild, it'll mean you're still free.  No matter where you are." -- Rick Bass]]>
