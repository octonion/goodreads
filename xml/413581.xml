	    <![CDATA["If you want to forget something or someone, never hate it, or never hate him/her. Everything and everyone that you hate is engraved upon your heart; if you want to let go of something, if you want to forget, you cannot hate." -- C. JoyBell C.]]>

	    <![CDATA["There is no such thing as a &quot;broken family.&quot; Family is family, and is not determined by marriage certificates, divorce papers, and adoption documents. Families are made in the heart. The only time family becomes null is when those ties in the heart are cut. If you cut those ties, those people are not your family. If you make those ties, those people are your family. And if you hate those ties, those people will still be your family because whatever you hate will always be with you." -- C. JoyBell C.]]>

	    <![CDATA["To douchebags!&quot; he said, gesturing to Brad. &quot;And to girls that break your heart,&quot; he bowed his head to me. His eyes lost focus. &quot;And to the absolute fucking horror of losing your best friend because you were stupid enough to fall in love with her." -- Jamie McGuire]]>
