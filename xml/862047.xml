	    <![CDATA["The Lord works from the inside out. The world works from the outside in. The world would take people out of the slums. Christ would take the slums out of people, and then they would take themselves out of the slums.
The world would mold men by changing their environment. Christ changes men, who then change their environment. The world would shape human behavior, but Christ can change human nature." -- Ezra Taft Benson]]>

	    <![CDATA["Men and women who turn their lives over to God will discover that He can make a lot more out of their lives than they can.  He can deepen their joys, expand their vision, quicken their minds, strengthen their muscles, lift their spirits, multiply their blessings, increase their opportunities, comfort their soals, and pour out peace." -- Ezra Taft Benson]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["It is a fundamental truth that the responsibilities of motherhood cannot be successfully delegated.  No, not to day-care centers, not to schools, not to nurseries, not to babysitters.  We become enamored with men’s theories such as the idea of preschool training outside the home for young children.   Not only does this put added pressure on the budget, but it places young children in an environment away from mother’s influence.  Too often the pressure for popularity, on children and teens, places an economic burden on the income of the father, so mother feels she must go to work to satisfy her children’s needs.  That decision can be most shortsighted.  It is mother’s influence during the crucial formative years that forms a child’s basic character.  Home is the place where a child learns faith, feels love, and thereby learns from mother’s loving example to choose righteousness.  How vital are mother’s influence and teaching in the home—and how apparent when neglected!" -- Ezra Taft Benson]]>

	    <![CDATA["God loves us.  He's watching us, he wants us to succeed, and we'll know someday that he has not left one thing undone for the eternal welfare of each of us.  If we only knew it, there are heavenly hosts pulling for us -- friends in heaven that we can't rememer now, who yearn for our victory." -- Ezra Taft Benson]]>
