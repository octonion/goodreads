	    <![CDATA["Aureliano not only understood by then, he also lived 
his brother’s experiences as something of his own, for on one occasion when the latter was 
explaining in great detail the mechanism of love, he interrupted him to ask: “What does it feel 
like?” José Arcadio gave an immediate reply: 
 
“It’s like an earthquake." -- Gabriel García Márquez]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Although some men who were easy with their words said that it was worth sacrificing one’s life for a night of love with such an arousing woman, the truth was that no one made any effort to do so.
