		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Devotion gradually progresses to higher levels. . . .  One type goes to God and asks Him to remove his suffering.  Another one will ask for money or material things.  A third will request liberation or release from his bondage. And the fourth will not ask for anything.  He will just enjoy praying and praising his Lord.  That is the highest form of prayer.  (Beyond Word, 119)" -- Sri Swami Satchidananda]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Analysis helps patients put their unconscious procedural memories and actions into words and into context, so they can better understand them.  In the process they plastically retranscribe these procedural memories, so that they become conscious explicit memories, sometimes for the first time, and patients no longer need to &quot;relive&quot; or &quot;reenact&quot; them, especially if they were traumatic.

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Psychoanalysis is often about turning our ghosts into ancestors, even for patients who have not lost loved ones to death.  We are often haunted by important relationships from the past that influence us unconsciously in the present.  As we work them through, they go from haunting us to becoming simply part of our history.  (243)" -- norman doidge]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Not all activities are equal in this regard.  Those that involve genuine concentration—studying a musical instrument, playing board games, reading, and dancing—are associated with a lower risk for dementia.  Dancing, which requires learning new moves, is both physically and mentally challenging and requires much concentration.  Less intense activities, such as bowling, babysitting, and golfing, are not associated with a reduced incidence of Alzheimer’s.  (254)" -- Norman Doidge]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Quoting from Thomas Merton
Dialogues With Silence
The true contemplative is not one who prepares his mind for a particular message that he wants or expects to hear, but is one who remains empty because he knows that he can never expect to anticipate the words that will transform his darkness into light.  He does not even anticipate a special kind of transformation.  He does not demand light instead of darkness.  He waits on the Word of God in silence, and, when he is answered it is not so much by a word that bursts into his silence.  It is by his silence itself, suddenly, inexplicably revealing itself to him as a word of great power, full of the voice of God.  (17)" -- Stephen Cope]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Quoting from Phillip Moffitt
Will Yoga and Meditation Really Change My Life?
The most profound change I’m aware of just now is a growing realization that life is not personal.  This may seem a surprising or even strange view to those unfamiliar with Eastern spirituality, but it has powerful implications.  It’s very freeing to see that events in my life are arising because of circumstances in which I am not involved, but that I’m not at the center of them in any particular way.  They’re impersonal.  They’re arising because of causes and conditions.  They are not “me.”  There is a profound freedom in this.  It makes life much more peaceful and harmonious because I’m not in reaction to events all the time.  (134)" -- Stephen Cope]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Sometimes customizing is necessary because of an injury or the inability to do, for a short or long period, the kind of exercise you formerly did.  When you're used to customizing for fun, doing it under duress won't seem like such an imposition.  Either way, experiment until you find activities that make you happy as well as healthy.  Choose your exercise using the same criteria you'd apply to choosing a date--that is, attractive to you and able to hold your interest for an hour." -- Victoria Moran]]>

	    <![CDATA["You give up on what you need to be doing because you forget that you're worth it.

When you don't believe in yourself this much, pretend." -- Victoria Moran]]>

	    <![CDATA["Practice giving things away, not just things you don't care about, but things you do like.  Remember, it is not the size of a gift, it is its quality and the amount of mental attachment you overcome that count.  So don't bankrupt yourself on a momentary positive impulse, only to regret it later.  Give thought to giving.  Give small things, carefully, and observe the mental processes going along with the act of releasing the little thing you liked.  (53)
(Quote is actually Robert A F Thurman but Huston Smith, who only wrote the introduction to my edition, seems to be given full credit for this text.)" -- Huston Smith]]>
