	    <![CDATA["Owners of dogs will have noticed that, if you provide them with food and water and shelter and affection, they will think you are god. Whereas owners of cats are compelled to realize that, if you provide them with food and water and shelter and affection, they draw the conclusion that &lt;i&gt;they&lt;/i&gt; are gods." -- Christopher Hitchens]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Beware the irrational, however seductive. Shun the 'transcendent' and all who invite you to subordinate or annihilate yourself. Distrust compassion; prefer dignity for yourself and others. Don't be afraid to be thought arrogant or selfish. Picture all experts as if they were mammals. Never be a spectator of unfairness or stupidity. Seek out argument and disputation for their own sake; the grave will supply plenty of time for silence. Suspect your own motives, and all excuses. Do not live for others any more than you would expect others to live for you." -- Christopher Hitchens]]>

	    <![CDATA["Any given man sees only a tiny portion of the total truth, and very often, in fact almost perpetually, he deliberately deceives himself about the little precious fragment as well. A portion of him turns against him and acts like another person, defeating him from inside." -- From A Scanner Darkly]]>
