	    <![CDATA["I felt after I finished Slaughterhouse-Five that I didn’t have to write at all anymore if I didn’t want to. It was the end of some sort of career. I don’t know why, exactly. I suppose that flowers, when they’re through blooming, have some sort of awareness of some purpose having been served. Flowers didn’t ask to be flowers and I didn’t ask to be me. At the end of Slaughterhouse-Five…I had a shutting-off feeling…that I had done what I was supposed to do and everything was OK ." -- Kurt Vonnegut]]>

	    <![CDATA["Our conversations are never easy, but as I-we-get older, we are finding that our conversations must bespoken.  A need burns inside us to share with others what we are feeling Beyond a certain age, sincerity ceases to feel pornographic.  It is as though the coolness that marked out youth is itself a type of retrovirus that can only leave you feeling empty. Full of holes." -- Douglas Coupland]]>
