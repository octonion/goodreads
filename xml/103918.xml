		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I knelt and prayed, and the strongest truth came over me.  Didn't matter if God in his heaven was a Catholic or a Protestant God, or the God of the Hindus.  What mattered was something deeper and older and more powerful than any such image - it was a concept of goodness based upon the affirmation of life, the turning away from destruction, from the perverse, from man using and abusing man.  It was the affirmation of the human and the natural." -- Anne Rice]]>

	    <![CDATA["It's everybody, I mean. Everything everybody does is so — I don't know — not wrong, or even mean, or even stupid necessarily. But just so tiny and meaningless and — sad-making. And the worst part is, if you go bohemian or something crazy like that, you're conforming just as much only in a different way." -- J.D. Salinger]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I hadn't been out to the hives before, so to start off she gave me a lesson in what she called 'bee yard etiquette'. She reminded me that the world was really one bee yard, and the same rules work fine in both places. Don't be afraid, as no life-loving bee wants to sting you. Still, don't be an idiot; wear long sleeves and pants. Don't swat. Don't even think about swatting. If you feel angry, whistle. Anger agitates while whistling melts a bee's temper. Act like you know what you're doing, even if you don't. Above all, send the bees love. Every little thing wants to be loved." -- Sue Monk Kidd]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I cannot emphasize enough how wrongheaded this is.  Withholding criticism and ignoring differences are racism in its purest form.  Yet these cultural experts fail to notice that, through their anxious avoidance of criticizing non-Western countries, they trap the people who represent these cultures in a state of backwardness.  The experts may have the best of intentions, but as we all know, the road to hell is paved with good intentions." -- Ayaan Hirsi Ali]]>
