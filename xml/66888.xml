	    <![CDATA["She knew this music--knew it down to the very core of her being--but she had never heard it before.  Unfamiliar, it had still always been there inside her, waiting to be woken.

It demanded to be accepted by simple faith, not dissected or questioned, and at the same time, it begged to be doubted and probed." -- Charles de Lint]]>

A cake is what is served on the happiest days of your life." -- Jeanne Ray]]>
