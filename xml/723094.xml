	    <![CDATA["Live a good life. If there are gods and they are just, then they will not care how devout you have been, but will welcome you based on the virtues you have lived by. If there are gods, but unjust, then you should not want to worship them. If there are no gods, then you will be gone, but will have lived a noble life that will live on in the memories of your loved ones." -- Anonymous]]>

	    <![CDATA["A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects." -- Robert A. Heinlein]]>

	    <![CDATA["And so now I'd like to say - people can change anything they want to.  And that means everything in the world.  People are running about following their little tracks - I am one of them.  But we've all got to stop just following our own little mouse trail.  People can do anything - this is something that I'm beginning to learn.  People are out there doing bad things to each other.  That's because they've been dehumanised.  It's time to take the humanity back into the center of the ring and follow that for a time.  Greed, it ain't going anywhere.  They should have that in a big billboard across Times Square.  Without people you're nothing.  That's my spiel." -- Joe Strummer]]>
