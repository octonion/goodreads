	    <![CDATA["Souls cross ages like clouds cross skies, an' tho' a cloud's shape nor hue nor size don't stay the same, it's still a cloud an' so is a soul. Who can say where the cloud's blowed from or who the soul'll be 'morrow? Only Sonmi the east an' the west an' the compass an' the atlas, yay, only the atlas o' clouds." -- David Mitchell]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Three or four times only in my youth did I glimpse the Joyous Isles, before they were lost to fogs, depressions, cold fronts, ill winds, and contrary tides... I mistook them for adulthood. Assuming they were a fixed feature in my life's voyage, I neglected to record their latitude, their longitude, their approach. Young ruddy fool. What wouldn't I give now for a never-changing map of the ever-constant ineffable? To possess, as it were, an atlas of clouds." -- David Mitchell]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Strip back the beliefs pasted on by governesses, schools, and states, you find indelible truths at one's core.  Rome'll decline and fall again, Cortés'll lay Tenochtitlán to waste again, and later, Ewing will sail again, Adrian'll be blown to pieces again, you and I'll sleep under the Corsican stars again, I'll come to Bruges again, fall in and out of love with Eva again, you'll read this letter again, the sun'll grow cold again.  Nietzsche's gramophone record.  When it ends, the Old One plays it again, for an eternity of eternities." -- David Mitchell]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Behold your future, Cavendish the Younger.  You will not apply for membership, but the tribe of the elderly will claim you.  Your present will not keep pace with the world's.  This slippage will stretch your skin, sag your skeleton, erode your hair and memory, make your skin turn opaque so your twitching organs and blue-cheese veins will be semivisible.  You will venture out only in daylight, avoiding weekends and school holidays.  Language, too, will leave you behind, betraying your tribal affiliations whenever you speak.  On escalators, on trunk roads, in supermarket aisles, the living will overtake you, incessantly.  Elegant women will not see you.  Store detectives will not see you.  Salespeople will not see you, unless they sell stair lifts or fraudulent insurance policies.  Only babies, cats, and drug addicts will acknowledge your existence.  So do not fritter away your days.  Sooner than you fear, you will stand before a mirror in a care home, look at your body, and think, E.T., locked in a ruddy cupboard for a fortnight." -- David Mitchell]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Why fight the 'natural' (oh, weaselly word!) order of things?  Why?  Because of this--one fine day, a purely predatory world shall consume itself.  In an individual, selfishness uglifies the soul; for the human species, selfishness is extinction." -- David Mitchell]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["How vulgar, this hankering after immortality, how vain, how false.  Composers are merely scribblers of cave paintings.  One writes music because winter is eternal and because, if one didn't, the wolves and blizzards would be at one's throat all the sooner." -- David Mitchell]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I elbowed my way into the grubby café, bought a pie that tasted of shoe polish and a pot of tea with cork crumbs floating in it, and eavesdropped on a pair of Shetland pony breeders.  Despondency makes one hanker after lives one never led.  Why have you given your life to books, TC?  Dull, dull, dull!  The memoirs are bad enough, but all that ruddy fiction!  Hero goes on a journey, stranger comes to town, somebody wants something, they get it or they don't, will is pitted against will.  &quot;Admire me, for I am a metaphor." -- David Mitchell]]>
