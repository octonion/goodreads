	    <![CDATA["People marvel at the genius of Mozart because he supposedly wrote &quot;Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star&quot; at the age of three and composed his first symphony at the age of twelve.  And yes, of course he was a genius, but another way to look at it is that he just discovered early what it was God made him to do.  That's all.  For some reason, God gave him a little extra, or a little something different, and Mozart found out what that was and then got a head start on using it.  Of course he was brilliant, but that's not the point.  The point is he knew, and then he got to work." -- Charles Martin]]>

	    <![CDATA["We know that God is everywhere; but certainly we feel His presence most when His works are on the grandest scale spread before us; and it is in the unclouded night-sky, where His worlds wheel their silent course, that we read clearest His infinitude, His omnipotence, His omnipresence." -- Charlotte Brontë]]>
