		<description>
	    <![CDATA["It’s dark because you are trying too hard. Lightly child, lightly. Learn to do everything lightly. Yes, feel lightly even though you’re feeling deeply. Just lightly let things happen and lightly cope with them. So throw away your baggage and go forward. There are quicksands all about you, sucking at your feet, trying to suck you down into fear and self-pity and despair. That’s why you must walk so lightly. Lightly my darling..." -- Aldous Huxley]]>

	    <![CDATA["It's just that I don't want to be somebody's crush. If somebody likes me, I want them to like the real me, not what they think I am. And I don't want them to carry it around inside. I want them to show me, so I can feel it too." -- Stephen Chbosky]]>

	    <![CDATA["In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since.
&quot;Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,&quot; he told me, &quot;just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had." -- F. Scott Fitzgerald]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter--tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther.... And one fine morning-- So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past." -- F. Scott Fitzgerald]]>
