	    <![CDATA["As I stood outside in Cow Lane, it occurred to me that Heaven must be a place where the library is open twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week.

No ... eight days a week." -- Alan Bradley]]>

	    <![CDATA["I remembered a piece of sisterly advice, which Feely once gave Daffy and me:
&quot;If ever you're accosted by a man,&quot; she'd said, &quot;kick him in the Casanovas and run like blue blazes!&quot;
Although it had sounded at the time like a useful bit of intelligence, the only problem was that I didn't know where the Casanovas were located.
I'd have to think of something else." -- Alan Bradley]]>

	    <![CDATA["Seed biscuits and milk! I hated Mrs. Mullet's seed biscuits the way Saint Paul hated sin. Perhaps even more so. I wanted to clamber up onto the table, and with a sausage on the end of a fork as my scepter, shout in my best Laurence Olivier voice, 'Will no one rid us of this turbulent pastry cook?" -- Alan Bradley]]>
