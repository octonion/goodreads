		<description>
	    <![CDATA["It may be laid down as a general rule that if a man begins to sing, no one will take any notice of his song except his fellow human beings. This is true even if his song is surpassingly beautiful. Other men may be in raptures at his skill, but the rest of creation is, by and large, unmoved. Perhaps a cat or a dog may look at him; his horse, if it is an exceptionally intelligent beast, may pause in cropping the grass, but that is the extent of it. But when the fairy sang, the whole world listened to him. Stephen felt clouds pause in their passing; he felt sleeping hills shift and murmur; he felt cold mists dance. He understood for the first time that the world is not dumb at all, but merely waiting for someone to speak to it in a language it understands. In the fairy's song the earth recognized the names by which it called itself." -- susanna clarke]]>

They all said she was pretentious, awkward, difficult to approach, prickly, too fond of her tales, haughty, prone to versifying, disdainful, cantankerous, and scornful. But when you meet her, she is strangely meek, a completely different person altogether!&quot;

How embarrassing! Do they really look upon me as a dull thing, I wonder? But I am what I am." -- Murasaki Shikibu]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["For some nights I slept profoundly; but still every morning I felt the same lassitude, and a languor weighed upon me all day.  I felt myself a changed girl.  A strange melancholy was stealing over me, a melancholy that I would not have interrupted.  Dim thoughts of death began to open, and an idea that I was slowly sinking took gentle, and, somehow, not unwelcome possession of me.  If it was sad, the tone of mind which this induced was also sweet.  Whatever it might be, my soul acquiesced in it." -- Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["You will think me cruel, very selfish, but love is always selfish; the more ardent the more selfish.  How jealous I am you cannot know. You must come with me, loving me, to death; or else hate me, and still come with me, and hating me through death and after. There is no such word as indifference in my apathetic nature." -- Sheridan Le Fanu]]>

I'm not cute or built to suit a fashion model's size
But when I start to tell them,
They think I'm telling lies.
I say,
It's in the reach of my arms
The span of my hips,
The stride of my step,
The curl of my lips.
I'm a woman
Phenomenally.
Phenomenal woman,
That's me." -- Maya Angelou]]>
