	    <![CDATA["I will try not to overlook the cruelties that victims inflict on one another as they are jammed together in the boxcars of the system.  I don’t want to romanticize them.  But I do remember (in rough paraphrase) a statement I once read: “The cry of the poor is not always just, but if you don’t listen to it, you will never know what justice is." -- Howard Zinn]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["There is not much talking now. A silence falls upon them all. This is no time to talk of hedges and fields, or the beauties of any country. Sadness and fear and hate, how they well up in the heart and mind, whenever one opens pages of these messengers of doom. Cry for the broken tribe, for the law and the custom that is gone. Aye, and cry aloud for the man who is dead, for the woman and children bereaved. Cry, the beloved country, these things are not yet at an end. The sun pours down on the earth, on the lovely land that man cannot enjoy. He knows only the fear of his heart." -- Alan Paton]]>

What's this!?" -- Wendell Berry]]>
