	    <![CDATA["It was lonely on the hill, and cold. And all you could do was keep going. You could scream, cry, and stamp your feet, but apart from making you feel warmer, it wouldn’t do any good. You could say it was unfair, and that was true, but the universe didn’t care because it didn’t know what “fair” meant. That was the big problem about being a witch. It was up to you. It was always up to you." -- Terry Pratchett]]>

	    <![CDATA["Vimes felt his hand begin to move of its own accord--
And stopped.  Red rage froze.
There was The Beast, all around him.  And that's all it was.  A beast. Useful, but still a beast.  You could hold it on a chain, and make it dance, and juggle balls.  It didn't think.  It was &lt;I&gt;dumb.&lt;/I&gt;  What you were, what &lt;I&gt;you&lt;/I&gt; were, was not The Beast." -- Terry Pratchett]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Although my body and I have reached if not peace, at least a state of détente, “fat” remains how I experience anger, dissatisfaction, disappointment. I feel “fat” if I can’t master a task at work. I feel “fat” if I can’t please those I love. “Fat” is how I blame myself for my failures. “Fat” is how I express my anxieties. A psychologist once told me, “Fat is not a feeling.” If only it were that simple. As for so many women, the pathology of self-loathing is permanently ingrained in me. I can give in to it, I can modify it, I can react against it with practiced self-acceptance, but I cannot eradicate it. It frustrates me to consider what else I might have done with the years of mental energy I have wasted on this single, senseless issue." -- Peggy Orenstein]]>
