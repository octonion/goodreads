		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I really didn't realize the librarians were, you know, such a dangerous group.
They are subversive. You think they're just sitting there at the desk, all quiet and everything. They're like plotting the revolution, man. I wouldn't mess with them. You know, they've had their budgets cut. They're paid nothing. Books are falling apart. The libraries are just like the ass end of everything, right?

	    <![CDATA["I wanted to explain that I am constantly overestimating and underestimating the human race - that rarely do I even simply estimate it. I wanted to ask her how the same thing could be so ugly and so glorious, and its words and stories so damning and brilliant...I AM HAUNTED BY HUMANS." -- Markus Zusak]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["A too often forgotten truth is that you can live through actual events of history and &lt;i&gt;completely miss&lt;/i&gt; the underlying reality of what's going.  What history misses, the myth clearly expresses.  The myth in the hands of a genius give us a clear picture of the inner import of life itself." -- Tom Harpur]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["You might have noticed that I have been sending you used books.  I have done this not to save money, but to make a point which is that a used book, unlike a used car, hasn't lost any of its initial value. A good story rolls of the lot into the hands of its new reader as smoothly as the day it was written. And there's another reason for these used paperbacks that never cost much even when new; I like the idea of holding a book that someone else has held, of eyes running over lines that have already seen the light of other eyes. That, in one image, is the community of readers, is the communion of literature." -- Yann Martel]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Let that be a reminder to you that the past is one thing, but what we make of it, the conclusions we draw, is another. History can be many things, depending on how we read it, just as the future can be many things, depending on how we live it. There is no inevitability to any historical occurrence, only what people will allow to take place. And it is by dreaming first that we get to new realities." -- Yann Martel]]>
