	    <![CDATA["You think when you wake up in the mornin yesterday dont count. But yesterday is all that does count. What else is there? Your life is made out of the days it's made out of. Nothin else. You might think you could run away and change your name and I dont know what all. Start over. And then one mornin you wake up and look at the ceilin and guess who's layin there?" -- Cormac McCarthy]]>

	    <![CDATA["Women intrinsically understand human dynamics, and that makes them unstoppable.  Unfortunately, the average man is less adroit at fostering such rivalries, which is why most men remain average; males are better at hating things that can't hate them back (e.g., lawnmowers, cats, the Denver Broncos, et cetera).  They don't see the big picture." -- Chuck Klosterman]]>
