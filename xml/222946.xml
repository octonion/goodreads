	    <![CDATA["Whatever you are physically...male or female, strong or weak, ill or healthy--all those things matter less than what your heart contains. If you have the soul of a warrior, you are a warrior. All those other things, they are the glass that contains the lamp, but &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; are the light inside." -- Cassandra Clare]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The hardest thing in the world is to assume the mood of a
warrior. It is of no use to be sad and complain and feel justified
in doing so, believing that someone is always doing something to us.
Nobody is doing anything to anybody, much less to a warrior." -- Don Juan Matus]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["They fought because they loved the dance, and the weight of a sword in their hands. The clash and spark of metal and hiss of flame was like music written just for them. They fought for glory, but not for blood. They were Weirlind, heirs of the warrior's stone. And they always slept better with blades beneath their beds." -- The Warrior Heir Cinda Williams Chima pg. 426]]>
