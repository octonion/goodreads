	    <![CDATA["It was madness to leave without your useless shit. You came in with it, you left with it--that was how it worked. What would you use to clutter a new office with if not your useless shit? We could remember Old Brizz with this box of useless shit, shifting the box from arm to arm as he talked with the building guy. Of course, Old Brizz never had an office again. His useless shit really was useless. He had cause to leave his useless shit behind. But his was a rare case. All things considered, it was better to take your useless shit with you." -- Joshua Ferris]]>

	    <![CDATA["A fun thing to do to let off steam after layoffs began was to go into someone's office and send an email from their computer addressed to the entire agency. It might say something simple like &quot;My name is Shaw-NEE! You are captured, Ha! I poopie I poopie I poopie.&quot; People came in in the morning and their reaction was so varied. 
Jim Jackers read it and immediately sent out an email that we read, &quot;Obviously someone come into my office last night and compossed an email in my name and sent it out to everyone. I apologise for any inconvenience or offence, although it wasn't my fault, and I would appreciate from whoever did this a public apology. I have read that email five times now and I still don't understand it." -- Joshua Ferris]]>
