	    <![CDATA["One day I would have all the books in the world, shelves and shelves of them. I would live my life in a tower of books. I would read all day long and eat peaches. And if any young knights in armor dared to come calling on their white chargers and plead with me to let down my hair, I would pelt them with peach pits until they went home." -- Jacqueline Kelly]]>

	    <![CDATA["Harry looked around; there was Ginny running toward him; she had a hard blazing look in her face as she threw her arms around him. And without thinking, without planning it, without worrying about the fact that fifty people were watching, Harry kissed her. After several long moments, or it might have been half an hour-or possibly several sunlit days- they broke apart." -- J.K. Rowling]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["You'd think people had better things to gossip about,&quot; said Ginny as she sat on the common room floor, leaning against Harry’s legs and reading the Daily Prophet. &quot;Three Dementor attacks in a week, and all Romilda Vane does is ask me if it’s true you’ve got a Hippogriff tattooed across your chest.&quot;
Ron and Hermione both roared with laughter. Harry ignored them.
What did you tell her?&quot;
I told her it's a Hungarian Horntail,&quot; said Ginny, turning a page of the newspaper idly. &quot;Much more macho.&quot;
Thanks,&quot; said Harry, grinning. &quot;And what did you tell her Ron’s got?&quot;
A Pygmy Puff, but I didn’t say where." -- J.K. Rowling]]>

	    <![CDATA["Who're you going with, then?&quot; said Ron.
&quot;Angelina,&quot; said Fred promptly, without a trace of embarrassment.
&quot;What?&quot; said Ron, taken aback. &quot;You've already asked her?&quot;
&quot;Good point,&quot; said Fred. He turned his head and called across the common room, &quot;Oi! Angelina!&quot;
Angelina, who had been chatting with Alicia Spinnet near the fire, looked over at him.
&quot;What?&quot; She called back.
&quot;Want to come to the ball with me?&quot;
Angelina gave Fred a sort of appraising look.
&quot;All right, then,&quot; she said, and she turned back to Alicia and carried on chatting with a bit of a grin on her face.
&quot;There you go,&quot; said Fred to Harry and Ron, &quot;piece of cake." -- J.K. Rowling]]>
