		<description>
	    <![CDATA["When you are five, you know your age down to the month.  Even in your twenties, you know how old you are. I'm twenty-three you say, or maybe twenty-seven. But then in your thirties, something strange starts to happen.  It is a mere hiccup at first, an instant of hesitation.  How old are you?  Oh, I'm--you start confidently, but then you stop.  You were going to say thirty-three, but you are not.  You're thirty-five.  And then you're bothered, because you wonder if this is the beginning of the end.  It is, of course, but it's decades before you admit it." -- Sara Gruen]]>

	    <![CDATA["Most people in Atlanta don't have an accent. It's pretty urban. A lot of people speak gangsta, though,&quot; I add jokingly. 
&quot;Fo' shiz,&quot; he replies in his polite English accent. 
I spurt orangey-red soup across the table. St. Clair gives a surprised ha-HA kind of laugh, and I'm laughing too, the painful kind like abdominal crunches. He hands me a napkin to wipe my chin. &quot;Fo'. Shiz.&quot; He repeats it solemnly.
Cough cough. &quot;Please don't ever stop saying that. It's too-&quot; I gasp. &quot;Much.&quot;
&quot;You oughtn't to have said that. Now I shall have to save it for special occasions.&quot;
&quot;My birthday is in February.&quot; Cough choke wheeze. &quot;Please don't forget." -- Stephanie Perkins]]>

&quot;That's sensible of you,&quot; I say, smiling too. &quot;We should find some paper so you can make a list or a chart or something.&quot;
I feel his laughter against my side, his nose sliding along my jaw, his lips pressing my ear.

I laugh a little. &quot;Then you should know better.&quot;
