	    <![CDATA["Witches are naturally nosy,” said Miss Tick, standing up.  “Well, I must go.  I hope we shall meet again.  I will give you some free advice, though.”
“Will it cost me anything?”
“What?  I just said it was free!” said Miss Tick.
“Yes, but my father said that free advice often turns out to be expensive,” said Tiffany.
Miss Tick sniffed.  “You could say this advice is priceless,” she said, “Are you listening?”
“Yes,” said Tiffany.
“Good.  Now...if you trust in yourself...”
“Yes?”
“...and believe in your dreams...”
“Yes?”
“...and follow your star...” Miss Tick went on.
“Yes?”
“...you’ll still be beaten by people who spent their time working hard and learning things and weren’t so lazy.  Goodbye." -- Terry Pratchett]]>
