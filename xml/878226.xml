	    <![CDATA["People worry about kids playing with guns, and teenagers watching violent videos; we are scared that some sort of culture of violence will take them over.

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Maybe we all live life at too high a pitch, those of us who absorb emotional things all day, and as mere consequence we can never feel merely content: we have to be unhappy, or ecstatically, head-over-heels happy, and those states are difficult to achieve within a stable, solid relationship." -- Nick Hornby]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["We all spend so much time not saying what we want, because we know we can't have it.  And because it sounds ungracious, or ungrateful, or disloyal, or childish, or banal.  Or because we're so desperate to pretend that things are OK, really, that confessing to ourselves they're not looks like a bad move.  Go on, say what you want.  ...  Whatever it is, say it to yourself.  The truth will set you free.  Either that or it'll get you a punch in the nose.  Surviving in whatever life you're living means lying, and lying corrodes the soul, so take a break from the lies for just one minute." -- Nick Hornby]]>
