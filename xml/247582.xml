	    <![CDATA["And then there was one last body that stood out from the rest.  It had signs of of bruising on all four ankles and all along its side.  Brownie had said that all the dogs that didn't die from being hanged were drowned, except one.
As that dog lay on the ground fighting for air, Quanis Phillips grabbed its front legs and Michael Vick grabbed its hind legs.  They swung the dog over their head like a jump rope then slammed it to the ground.  The first impact didn't kill it.  So [they] slammed it again. The two men kept at it, alternating back and forth, pounding the  creature against the ground, until at last, the little red dog was dead." -- Jim Gorant (Author)]]>
