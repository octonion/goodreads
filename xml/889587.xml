		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Good. Item seven. The &lt;i&gt;had had&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;that that&lt;/i&gt; problem. Lady Cavendish, weren’t you working on this?’ 

Lady Cavendish stood up and gathered her thoughts. ‘Indeed. The uses of &lt;i&gt;had had&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;that that&lt;/i&gt; have to be strictly controlled; they can interrupt the imaginotransference quite dramatically, causing readers to go back over the sentence in confusion, something we try to avoid.’

 ‘Go on.’

 ‘It’s mostly an unlicensed-usage problem. At the last count David Copperfield alone had had &lt;i&gt;had had&lt;/i&gt; sixty three times, all but ten unapproved. Pilgrim’s Progress may also be a problem due to its &lt;i&gt;had had/that that&lt;/i&gt; ratio.’

 ‘So what’s the problem in Progress?’ 

 ‘That that had &lt;i&gt;that that&lt;/i&gt; ten times but had had &lt;i&gt;had had&lt;/i&gt; only thrice. Increased &lt;i&gt;had had&lt;/i&gt; usage had had to be overlooked, but not if the number exceeds that &lt;i&gt;that that&lt;/i&gt; usage.’

 ‘Hmm,’ said the Bellman, ‘I thought &lt;i&gt;had had&lt;/i&gt; had had TGC’s approval for use in Dickens? What’s the problem?’ 

 ‘Take the first &lt;i&gt;had had&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;that that&lt;/i&gt; in the book by way of example,’ said Lady Cavendish. ‘You would have thought that that first &lt;i&gt;had had&lt;/i&gt; had had good occasion to be seen as &lt;i&gt;had&lt;/i&gt;, had you not? &lt;i&gt;Had&lt;/i&gt; had had approval but &lt;i&gt;had had&lt;/i&gt; had not; equally it is true to say that that &lt;i&gt;that that&lt;/i&gt; had had approval but that that other &lt;i&gt;that that&lt;/i&gt; had not.’ 

 ‘So the problem with that other &lt;i&gt;that that&lt;/i&gt; was that…?’

 ‘That that other-other &lt;i&gt;that that&lt;/i&gt; had had approval.’ 

 ‘Okay’ said the Bellman, whose head was in danger of falling apart like a chocolate orange, ‘let me get this straight: David Copperfield, unlike Pilgrim’s Progress, had had &lt;i&gt;had&lt;/i&gt;, had had &lt;i&gt;had had&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Had had&lt;/i&gt; had had TGC’s approval?’

 There was a very long pause. ‘Right,’ said the Bellman with a sigh, ‘that’s it for the moment. I’ll be giving out assignments in ten minutes. Session’s over – and let’s be careful out there." -- Jasper Fforde]]>
