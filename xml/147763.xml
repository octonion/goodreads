	    <![CDATA["It is a magic book. Words mean things. When you put them together they speak. Yes, sometimes they flatten out and nothing they say is real, and that is one kind of magic. But sometimes a vision will rip up from them and shriek and clank wings clear as the sweat smudge on the paper under your thumb. And that is another kind." -- Samuel R. Delany]]>

	    <![CDATA["I will find you,&quot; he whispered in my ear.  &quot;I promise.  If I must endure two hundred years of purgatory, two hundred years without you - then that is my punishment, which I have earned for my crimes.  For I have lied, and killed, and stolen; betrayed and broken trust.  But there is the one thing that shall lie in the balance.  When I shall stand before God, I shall have one thing to say, to weigh against the rest.&quot;

His voice dropped, nearly to a whisper, and his arms tightened around me.

Lord, ye gave me a rare woman, and God!  I loved her well." -- Diana Gabaldon]]>
