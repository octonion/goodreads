	    <![CDATA["The spell. Victor said you had to want me... to care about me... for it to work.&quot; When he didn't say anything, I tried to grip his shirt, but my fingers were too weak. &quot;Did you? Did you want me?&quot;
His words came out thickly. &quot;Yes, Roza. I did want you. I still do. I wish... we could be together.&quot;
&quot;Then why did you lie to me?&quot;
We reached the clinic, and he managed to open the door while still holding me. As soon as he stepped inside, he began yelling for help. 
&quot;Why did you lie?&quot; I murmured again.
Still holding me in his arms, he looked down at me. I could hear voices and footsteps getting closer.
&quot;Because we can't be together.&quot;
&quot;Because of the age thing, right?&quot; I asked. &quot;Because you're my mentor?&quot;
His fingertip gently wiped away a tear that had escaped down my cheek. &quot;That's part of it,&quot; he said. &quot;But also... well, you and I will both be Lissa's gaurdians someday. I need to protect her at all cost. If a pack of Strogoi come, I need to throw my body between them and her.&quot;
I know that. Of course that's what you have to do.&quot; The black sparkles were dancing in front of my eyes again. I was fading out.
&quot;No. If I let myself love you, I won't throw myself in front of her. I'll throw myself in front of you." -- Richelle Mead]]>
