	    <![CDATA["Because immigrants have always been particularly prone to repetition - it's something to do with that experience of moving from West to East or East to West or from island to island.  Even when you arrive, you're still going back and forth; your children are going round and round.  There's no proper term for it - original sin seems too harsh; maybe original trauma would be better." -- Zadie Smith]]>

	    <![CDATA["...despite all this, it is still hard to admit that there is no one more English than the Indian, no one more Indian than the English.  There are still young white men who are angry about that; who will roll out at closing time into the poorly lit streets with a kitchen knife wrapped in a tight fist.  But it makes an immigrant laugh to hear the fears of the nationalist, scared of infection, penetration, miscegenation, when this is small fry, peanuts, compared to what the immigrant fears - dissolution, disappearance." -- Zadie Smith]]>

	    <![CDATA["It wasn't like the spare rooms of immigrants - packed to the rafters with all that they have ever possessed, no matter how defective or damaged, mountains of odds and ends - the stand testament to the fact that they have things now, where before they had nothing." -- Zadie Smith]]>
