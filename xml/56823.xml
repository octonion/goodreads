	    <![CDATA["She continued it to Hugh, 'Darling, do you know what mother and you are going to find beyond the blue horizon rim?'
'What?' flatly.
'We're going to find elephants with golden howdahs from which peep young maharanees with necklaces of rubies, and a dawn sea colored like the breast of a dove, and a white an green house filled with books and silver tea-sets.'
'And cookies?'
'Cookies? Oh, most decidedly cookies. We've had enough of bread and porridge. We'd get sick on too many cookies, but ever so much sicker on no cookies at all." -- Sinclair Lewis]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Having a sister or a friend is like sitting at night in a lighted house. Those outside can watch you if they want, but you need not see them. You simply say, &quot;Here are the perimeters of our attention. If you prowl around under the windows till the crickets go silent, we will pull the shades. If you wish us to suffer your envious curiosity, you must permit us not to notice it.&quot; Anyone with one solid human bond is that smug, and it is the smugness as much as the comfort and safety that lonely people covet and admire." -- Marilynne Robinson]]>

	    <![CDATA["It was a source of both terror and comfort to me then that I often seemed invisible â€” incompletely and minimally existent, in fact. It seemed to me that I made no impact on the world, and that in exchange I was privileged to watch it unawares." -- Marilynne Robinson]]>
