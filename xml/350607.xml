	    <![CDATA["It happens all the time in heaven,
And some day

It will begin to happen
Again on earth - 

That men and women who are married,
And men and men who are 
Lovers,

And women and women
Who give each other
Light,

Often will get down on their knees

And while so tenderly 
Holding their lover's hand,

With tears in their eyes,
Will sincerely speak, saying,

My dear,
How can I be more loving to you;

How can I be more kind?" -- شمس الدین محمد حافظ / Shams-al-Din Mohammad Hafez]]>

	    <![CDATA["We are now in the mountains and they are in us, kindling enthusiasm, making every nerve quiver, filling every pore and cell of us. Our flesh-and-bone tabernacle seems transparent as glass to the beauty about us, as if truly an inseparable part of it, thrilling with the air and trees, streams and rocks, in the waves of the sun,—a part of all nature, neither old nor young, sick nor well, but immortal." -- John Muir]]>
