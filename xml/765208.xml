		<description>
	    <![CDATA["If Adam and Eve were not hunter-gatherers, then they were certainly gatherers.  But, then, consumer desire, or self-embitterment, or the 'itch,' as Schopenhauer called it, appeared in the shape of the serpent.  This capitalistic monster awakens in Adam and Eve the possibility that things could be better.  Instantly, they are cast out of the garden and condemned to a life of toil, drudgery, and pain.  Wants supplanted needs, and things have been going downhill ever since.  " -- Tom Hodgkinson]]>

	    <![CDATA["Man has imagined a heaven, and has left entirely out of it the supremest of all his delights...sexual intercourse!...His heaven is like himself: strange, interesting, astonishing, grotesque. I give you my word, it has not a single feature in it that he actually values." -- Mark Twain]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["This loss [of freedom] means the fading from human life of values infinitely precious to it.  The divergent use of individual temperaments can no longer find their various satisfactions in serious activities.  There only remain ironbound conditions of employment and trivial amusements for leisure.  " -- A. N. Whitehead]]>
