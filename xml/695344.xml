		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Every man has some reminiscences which he would not tell to everyone, but only to his friends. He has others which he would not reveal even to his friends, but only to himself, and that in secret. But finally there are still others which a man is even afraid to tell himself, and every decent man has a considerable number of such things stored away.  That is, one can even say that the more decent he is, the greater the number of such things in his mind." -- Fyodor Dostoevsky]]>

	    <![CDATA["Every now and then, I'll run into someone who claims not to like chocolate, and while we live in a country where everyone has the right to eat what they want, I want to say for the record that I don't trust these people, that I think something is wrong with them, and that they're probably - and this must be said - total duds in bed." -- Steve Almond]]>
