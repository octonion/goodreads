	    <![CDATA["Therefore I beg you, reader, not to rejoice too greatly if you have read much, but if you have understood much.  Nor that you have understood much, but that you have been able to retain it.  Otherwise it is of little profit either to read or to understand." -- Hugh of Saint Victor]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["A kernel of truth lurks at the heart of religion, because spiritual experience, ethical behavior, and strong communities are essential for human happiness. And yet our religious traditions are intellectually defunct and politically ruinous. While spiritual experience is clearly a natural propensity of the human mind, we need not believe anything on insufficient evidence to actualize it." -- Sam Harris]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Hope and fear come from feeling that we lack something; they come from a sense of poverty.  We can’t simply relax with ourselves.  We hold on to hope, and hope robs us of the present moment.  We feel that someone else knows what is going on, but that there is something missing in us, and therefore something is lacking in our world." -- Pema Chödrön]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["A written word is the choicest of relics.  It is something at once more intimate with us and more universal than any other work of art.  It is the work of art nearest to life itself.  It may be translated into every language, and not only be read but actually breathed from all human lips; -- not be represented on canvas or in marble only, but be carved out of the breath of life itself." -- Henry David Thoreau]]>
