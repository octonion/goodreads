		<description>
	    <![CDATA["... the connection between imperial politics and culture is astonishingly direct. American attitudes to American &quot;greatness&quot;, to hierarchies of race, to the perils of &quot;other&quot; revolutions (the American revolution being considered unique and somehow unrepeatable anywhere else in the world) have remained constant, have dictated, have obscured, the realities of empire, while apologists for overseas American interests have insisted on American innocence, doing good, fighting for freedom." -- Edward Said]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Consider that in 1800 Western powers claimed 55 percent but actually held approximately 35 percent of the earth's surface, and that by 1874 the proportion was 67 percent, a rate of increase of 83,000 square miles per year. By 1914, the annual rate had risen to an astonishing 240,000 square miles [per year], and Europe held a grand total of roughly 85 percent of the earth as colonies, protectorates, dependencies, dominions, and commonwealths. No other associated set of colonies in history was as large, none so totally dominated, none so unequal in power to the Western metropolis.&quot; Culture and Imperialism, pg. 8" -- Edward Said]]>
