		<description>
	    <![CDATA["God freely created us so that we might know, love, and serve him in this life and be happy with him forever.  God's purpose in creating us is to draw forth from us a response of love and service here on earth, so that we may attain our goal of everlasting happiness with him in heaven. 
All the things in this world are gifts of God, created for us, to be the means by which we can come to know him better, love him more surely, and serve him more faithfully.  
As a result, we ought to appreciate and use these gifts of God insofar as they help us toward our goal of loving service and union with God. But insofar as any created things hinder our progress toward our goal, we ought to let them go." -- St. Ignatius of Loyola]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["... every moment of our life has a purpose, that every action of ours, no matter how dull or routine or trivial it may seem in itself, has a dignity and a worth beyond human understanding... For it means that no moment can be wasted, no opportunity missed, since each has a purpose in man’s life, each has a purpose in God’s plan.  Think of your day, today or yesterday.  Think of the work you did, the people you met, moment by moment.  What did it mean to you- and might it have meant for God?  Is the question too simple to answer, or are we just afraid to ask it for fear of the answer we must give?" -- Walter J. Ciszek]]>
