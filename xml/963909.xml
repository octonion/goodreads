	    <![CDATA["Margaret Atwood, the Canadian novelist, once asked a group of women at a university why they felt threatened by men. The women said they were afraid of being beaten, raped, or killed by men. She then asked a group of men why they felt threatened by women. They said they were afraid women would laugh at them." -- Molly Ivins]]>

	    <![CDATA["It's all very well to run around saying regulation is bad, get the government off our backs, etc. Of course our lives are regulated. When you come to a stop sign, you stop; if you want to go fishing, you get a license; if you want to shoot ducks, you can shoot only three ducks. The alternative is dead bodies at the intersection, no fish, and no ducks. OK?

(&lt;i&gt;Getting Control of the Frontier&lt;/i&gt;, Gainsville Sun, March 22, 1995)" -- Molly Ivins]]>
