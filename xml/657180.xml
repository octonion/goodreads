		<description>
	    <![CDATA["She understood now why her friend Elizabeth, with her near-genius, analytical mind gave wide berth to murder mysteries, psychological thrillers, and horror stories, and read only romance novels. Because, by God, when a woman picked up one of those steamy books, she had a firm guarantee that there would be a Happily-Ever-After. That though the world outside those covers could bring such sorrow and disappointment and loneliness, between those covers, the world was a splendid place to be." -- Karen Marie Moning]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I love books, by the way, way more than movies. Movies tell you what to think. A good book lets you choose a few thoughts for yourself. Movies show you the pink house. A good book tells you there's a pink house and lets you paint some of the finishing touches, maybe choose the roof style,park your own car out front. My imagination has always topped anything a movie could come up with. Case in point, those darned Harry Potter movies. That was so not what that part-Veela-chick, Fleur Delacour, looked like." -- Karen Marie Moning]]>

	    <![CDATA["Every time I think I’m getting smarter I realize that I’ve just done something stupid. Dad says there are three kinds of people in the world: those who don’t know, and don’t know they don’t know; those who don’t know and do know they don’t know; and those who know and know how much they still don’t know.

Heavy stuff, I know. I think I’ve finally graduated from the don’t-knows that don’t know to the don’t-knows
that do." -- Karen Marie Moning]]>

	    <![CDATA["His hand was on my throat, and he was crushing me back with his body into the cold steel beam behind me. &quot;Yes, I have loved, Ms. Lane, and although it‘s none of your business, I have lost. Many things. And no, I am not like any other player in this game and I will never be like V‘lane, and I get a hard-on a great deal more often than occasionally.&quot; He leaned fully against me and I gasped. 

&quot;Sometimes it‘s over a spoiled little girl, not a woman at all. And yes, I trashed the bookstore when I couldn‘t find you. You‘ll have to choose a new bedroom, too. And I‘m sorry your pretty little world got all screwed up, but everybody‘s does, and you go on. It‘s how you go on that defines you.&quot; His hand relaxed on my throat. &quot;And I am going to tattoo you, Ms. Lane, however and wherever I please." -- Karen Marie Moning]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I was about to look away when he reached across the seat, touched my jaw with his long, strong, beautiful fingers, and caressed my face.
Being touched by Jericho Barrons with kindness makes you feel like you must be the most special person in the world. It’s like walking up to the biggest, most savage lion in the jungle, lying down, placing your head it its mouth and, rather than taking your life, it licks you and purrs." -- Karen Marie Moning]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["He swapped the fistful of my shirt for one in my hair, and ground his mouth against mine. 
I exploded. 
I shoved at him, and clawed him closer. He shoved me back, and yanked me tighter to his body. I pulled his hair. He pulled mine. He didn‘t fight fair. Actually, he fought exactly fair. He didn‘t extend courtesies, not a single one. 
I bit his lip. He tripped me and pushed me down to the stone floor of the cavern. I punched him. He straddled me. 
I ripped his shirt down the front, left it hanging in tatters from his shoulders. 
&quot;I liked that shirt&quot;, he snarled. He rose over me, a dark demon, glistening in the torchlight, dripping sweat and blood, his torso covered with tattoos that disappeared beneath his waistband. 
He grabbed the hem of my shirt, tore it straight up to my neck, and inhaled sharply. " -- Karen Marie Moning]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Words can be twisted into any shape. Promises can be made to lull the heart and seduce the soul. In the final analysis, words mean nothing. They are labels we give things in an effort to wrap our puny little brains around their underlying natures, when ninety-nine percent of the time the totality of the reality is an entirely different beast. The wisest man is the silent one. Examine his actions. Judge him by them." -- Karen Marie Moning]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["There are only shades of gray. Black and white are nothing more than lofty ideals in our minds, the standards by which we try to judge things, and map out our place in the world in relevance to them. Good and evil, in their purest form, are as intangible and forever beyond our ability to hold in our hand as any Fae illusion. We can only aim at them, aspire to them, and hope not to get so lost in the shadows that we can no longer aim for the light." -- Karen Marie Moning]]>

I swallowed. Yes, I certainly remembered that. &quot;I was out of my mind. I‘d never have done it otherwise.&quot; 

&lt;i&gt;Really&lt;/i&gt;, his dark eyes mocked, and in them I was demanding more, telling him I wanted it to always be this way.

His eyes didn't say, &lt;i&gt;I'd heat you up,&lt;/i&gt; and mine didn't say &lt;i&gt;What are you waiting for?&lt;/i&gt; He didn't reply, &lt;i&gt;Fuck if I'm making the first move,&lt;/i&gt; so I was careful not to say, &lt;i&gt;I wish you would, because I can't, because I'm...&lt;/i&gt; and he didn't snap &lt;i&gt;...choking on your pride?!&lt;/i&gt;
&quot;As if you aren't.&quot;
&quot;Excuse me?&quot;
&quot;Really Barrons,&quot; I said drily. &quot;I'm not the only one who didn't just not have that conversation, and you know it.&quot;
There was the faint, sexy lift of his lip. &quot;You're a piece of work, Ms. Lane.&quot;

	    <![CDATA["Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do." -- Apple Computer Inc.]]>
