		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I picked up the butter-soft suede shirt and slacks and held them toward Martucci, but he bent over, grabbing at his stomach, and made it into the dark little cubicle in time to vomit into the toilet.  He ran the small trickle of water in the sink over his hands, dabbed water on his face, then blotted himself on the rough paper towels.  Within the next five minutes, he was dressed and deposited in the rear seat of my car between Haley and Finn.  Vito, who had scared the living hell out of the hustler before giving him a kick in the ass out the hotel's side door, sat next to me as I drove.  Vito was breathing heavily; it was the only sound in the car." -- Dorothy Uhnak]]>

His shoulders jerked and head sagged a little while his heart broke. Old Man cried the mute cry of men of his generation." -- Ed Lynskey]]>

	    <![CDATA["Integrity is not a conditional word.  It doesn't blow in the wind or change with the weather. It is your inner image of yourself, and if you look in there and see a man who won't cheat, then you know he never will. Integrity is not a search for the rewards of integrity. Maybe all you ever get for it is the largest kick in the ass the world can provide. It is not supposed to be a productive asset." -- John D. MacDonald]]>
