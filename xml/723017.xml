		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Do not assume that he who seeks to comfort you now, lives untroubled among the simple and quiet words that sometimes do you good. His life may also have much sadness and difficulty, that remains far beyond yours. Were it otherwise, he would never have been able to find these words." -- Rainer Maria Rilke]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Once the realization is accepted that even between the closest human beings infinite distances continue, a wonderful living side by side can grow, if they succeed in loving the distance between them which makes it possible for each to see the other whole against the sky." -- Rilke Rainer Maria]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["And your doubt can become a good quality if you &lt;i&gt;train&lt;/i&gt; it. It must become &lt;i&gt;knowing&lt;/i&gt;, it must become criticism. Ask it, whenever it wants to spoil something for you, &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; something is ugly, demand proofs from it, test it, and you will find it perhaps bewildered and embarrased, perhaps also protesting. But don't give in, insist on arguments, and act in this way, attentive and persistent, every single time, and the day will come when, instead of being a destroyer, it will become one of your best workers--perhaps the most intelligent of all the ones that are building your life." -- Rainer Maria Rilke]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["At no other time (than autumn) does the earth let itself be inhaled in one smell, the ripe earth; in a smell that is in no way inferior to the smell of the sea, bitter where it borders on taste, and more honeysweet where you feel it touching the first sounds.  Containing depth within itself, darkness, something of the grave almost." -- Rainer Maria Rilke]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I am learning to see. I don't know why it is, but everything enters me more deeply and doesn't stop where it once used to. I have an interior that I never knew of... What's the use of telling someone that I am changing? If I'm changing, I am no longer who I was; and if I am something else, it's obvious that I have no acquaintances. And I can't possibly write to strangers." -- Rainer Maria Rilke]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I want to learn how to hold the paradoxical poles of my identity together, to embrace the profoundly opposite truths that my sense of self is deeply dependent on others dancing with me and that I still have a sense of self when no one wants to dance." -- Parker J. Palmer]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Mentors and apprentices are partners in an ancient human dance, and one of teaching's great rewards is the daily chance it gives us to get back on the dance floor.  It is the dance of the spiraling generations, in which the old empower the young with their experience and the young empower the old with new life, reweaving the fabric of the human community as they touch and turn." -- Parker J. Palmer]]>
