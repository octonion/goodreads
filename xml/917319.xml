		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Because children have abounding vitality, because they are in spirit fierce and free, therefore they want things repeated and unchanged. They always say, &quot;Do it again&quot;; and the grown-up person does it again until he is nearly dead. For grown-up people are not strong enough to exult in monotony. But perhaps God is strong enough to exult in monotony. It is possible that God says every morning, &quot;Do it again&quot; to the sun; and every evening, &quot;Do it again&quot; to the moon. It may not be automatic necessity that makes all daisies alike; it may be that God makes every daisy separately, but has never got tired of making them. It may be that He has the eternal appetite of infancy; for we have sinned and grown old, and our Father is younger than we." -- G. K. Chesterton]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["What an astonishing thing a book is. It's a flat object made from a tree with flexible parts on which are imprinted lots of funny dark squiggles. But one glance at it and you're inside the mind of another person, maybe somebody dead for thousands of years. Across the millennia, an author is speaking clearly and silently inside your head, directly to you. Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions, binding together people who never knew each other, citizens of distant epochs. Books break the shackles of time. A book is proof that humans are capable of working magic.&quot;

[&lt;i&gt;Cosmos, Part 11: The Persistence of Memory&lt;/i&gt; (1980)]" -- Carl Sagan]]>
