	    <![CDATA["Deserves it! I daresay he does. Many that live deserve death. And some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them? Then do not be too eager to deal out death in judgement. For even the very wise cannot see all ends." -- J.R.R. Tolkien]]>

	    <![CDATA["You are not special. You're not a beautiful and unique snowflake. You're the same decaying organic matter as everything else. We're all part of the same compost heap. We're all singing, all dancing crap of the world." -- Chuck Palahniuk]]>

	    <![CDATA["Behind me, I heard a young woman of 25 say, &quot;If it weren’t for my horse, I wouldn’t have spent that year in college.&quot; Now, I'm gonna repeat that, because it bears repeating. &quot;If it weren't for my horse...&quot; as in, giddyup, giddyup, let's go — &quot;I wouldn't have spent that year in college,&quot; which is a degree-granting institution. Don't think about that too long, or BLOOD will shoot out your NOSE!" -- Lewis Black]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["At first glance, the key and the lock it fits may seem very different,&quot; Sazed said. &quot;Different in shape, different in function, different in design. The man who looks at them without knowledge of their true nature might think them opposites, for one is meant to open, and the other to keep closed. Yet, upon closer examination he might see that without one, the other becomes useless. The wise man then sees that both lock and key were created for the same purpose." -- Brandon Sanderson]]>
