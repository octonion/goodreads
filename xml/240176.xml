&quot;What is the matter with you?&quot;  Charlie asks his daughter.  &quot;Any sane person would have told me to go to the doctor.  I'm seeing a headless apparition every day.  Maybe my medications are conflicting.  You should see the list of side effects on this stuff." -- Joey Comeau]]>

	    <![CDATA["I love those dark moments in Peanuts. I love that they're in there, that Charles Schulz put the sad lonely bits of himself into the comic. I love the silliness too, the dancing Snoopy strips. The little boy Rerun drawing &quot;basement&quot; comics about Tarzan fighting Daffy Duck in a helicopter. Those are the bits that keep me reading. The funny parts! The fun parts. The silly bits that don't make any sense. And when I get to the sad lonely Peppermint Patty standing in a field wondering why nobody shook hands and said &quot;good game,&quot; well, it works because that's not all she was. I try to think that way about everything. That's the kind of person I want to be." -- Joey Comeau]]>
