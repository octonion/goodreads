		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Never did she find anything so difficult as to keep herself from losing her temper when she was suddenly disturbed while absorbed in a book. People who are fond of books know the feeling of irritation which sweeps over them at such a moment. The temptation to be unreasonable and snappish is one not easy to manage.

&quot;It makes me feel as if something had hit me,&quot; Sara had told Ermengarde once in confidence. &quot;And as if I want to hit back. I have to remember things quickly to keep from saying something ill-tempered." -- Frances Hodgson Burnett]]>

This much, at least, I've figured out. I know this much is true." -- Wally Lamb]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["He could not tell her that he was angry because she did not love him.  Even he could not utter such foolishness.  Certainly, he did not love her.  He did not love anyone except perhaps Isaac and a very few of his other children.  Yet he wanted Anyanwu to be like his many other women and treat him like a god in human form, competing for his attention no matter how repugnant his latest body nor even whether he might be looking for a new body.  They knew he took women almost as readily as he took men.  Especially, he took women who had already given him what he wanted of them--usually several children.  They served him and never thought they might be his next victims.  Someone else.  Not them." -- Octavia E. Butler]]>

	    <![CDATA["I don't think you ever get to relax. I mean, sure there's a couple of people who could, but I bet they don't. Because by the time they get to where they could relax, they don't. Because by the time they get to where they could relax, they've gotten completely used to not being able to. How do you just suddenly become somebody who relaxes? The kind of ambition you need to get to that place is not relaxing. It's searing. I think there's probably something about living your whole life in a popularity contest -- trying to get people to like you who you couldn't give a flying fuck about -- that kills relaxation." -- Carrie Fisher]]>
