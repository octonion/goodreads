		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I know well that healing comes-if one is brave-from within, through profound resignation to suffering and death, through the surrender of your own will and of your self-love.  But that is of no use to me; I love to paint, to see people and things and everything that makes our life-artificial, if you like.  Yes, real life would be a different thing, but I do not belong to that category of souls who are ready to live and also at any moment to suffer. I am everything but courageous in sorrow, and everything but patient when I am not feeling well, though I have rather a good deal of patience in keeping to my work." -- Vincent van Gogh]]>
