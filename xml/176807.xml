		<description>
	    <![CDATA["What is it my dear?&quot;

Ah, how can we bear it?&quot;

Bear what?&quot;

This. For so short a time. How can we sleep this time away?&quot;

We can be quiet together, and pretend - since it is only the beginning - that we have all the time in the world.&quot;

And every day we shall have less. And then none.&quot;

Would you rather, therefore, have had nothing at all?&quot;

No. This is where I have always been coming to. Since my time began. And when I go away from here, this will be the mid-point, to which everything ran, before, and from which everything will run. But now, my love, we are here, we are now, and those other times are running elsewhere." -- A.S. Byatt]]>

	    <![CDATA["Coherence and closure are deep human desires that are presently unfashionable. But they are always both frightening and enchantingly desirable. &quot;Falling in love,&quot; characteristically, combs the appearances of the word, and of the particular lover's history, out of a random tangle and into a coherent plot." -- A.S.

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Julian was good at being in love.  But he was clever enough to know that what he really liked about being in love was the state of unconsummated tension... One had to believe that these lovely creatures were, in potentia, the longed for intimate friend from whom nothing need be hidden, by whom everything would be understood, forgiven and admired.  But Julian was clever and observant enough to see that love was at its most intense before it was reciprocated." -- A.S. Byatt]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["There is a loneliness that can be rocked.  Arms crossed, knees drawn up, holding, holding on, this motion, unlike a ship's, smooths and contains the rocker.  It's an inside kind--wrapped tight like skin.  Then there is the loneliness that roams.  No rocking can hold it down.  It is alive.  On its own.  A dry and spreading thing that makes the sound of one's own feet going seem to come from a far-off place." -- Toni Morrison]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Finally he said that if men drink the blood of God yet they do not understand the seriousness of what they do. He said that men wish to be serious but they do not understand how to be so. Between their acts and their ceremonies lies the world and in this world the storms blow and the trees twist in the wind and all the animals that God has made go to and fro yet this world men do not see. They see the acts of their own hands or they see that which they name and call out to one another but the world between is invisible to them" -- Cormac McCarthy]]>
