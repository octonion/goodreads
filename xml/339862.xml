		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I thought that if the right time gets missed, if one has refused or been refused something for too long, it's too late, even if it is finally tackled with energy and received with joy. Or is there no such thing as &quot;too late&quot;?  Is there only &quot;late,&quot; and is &quot;late&quot; always better than &quot;never&quot;? I don't know." -- Bernhard Schlink]]>

I must have been what any author would consider an ideal reader.  I felt every pain and pleasure suffered or enjoyed by all the characters.  Oh, but I identified!" -- Eudora Welty]]>
