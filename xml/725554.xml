		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Eventually something you love is going to be taken away. And then you will fall to the floor crying. And then, however much later, it is finally happening to you: you’re falling to the floor crying thinking, “I am falling to the floor crying,” but there’s an element of the ridiculous to it — you knew it would happen and, even worse, while you’re on the floor crying you look at the place where the wall meets the floor and you realize you didn’t paint it very well." -- Richard Siken]]>

You feel just fine in this position, and only one thing gives you worry or concern: how will you ever be able to get out of your pipe?" -- Charles Baudelaire]]>

	    <![CDATA["You must go further than I did,&quot; Nedra said. &quot;You know that.&quot;
&quot;Further?&quot;
&quot;With your life. You must become free.&quot;
She did not explain it; she could not. It was not a matter of living alone, though in her case this had been necessary. The freedom she meant was self-conquest. It was not a natural state. It was meant only for those who would risk everything for it, who were aware that without it life is only appetites until the teeth are gone." -- James Salter]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["...alone in this city, alone on this sea. The days were strewn about him, he was a drunkard of days. He had achieved nothing. He had his life--it was not worth much--not like a life that, though ended, had truly been something. If I had had courage,he thought, if I had had faith. We preserve ourselves as if that were important, and always at the expense of others. We hoard ourselves. We succeed if they fail, we are wise if they are foolish, and we go onward, clutching, until there is no one--we are left with no companion save God. In whom we do not believe. Who we know does not exist." -- James Salter]]>
