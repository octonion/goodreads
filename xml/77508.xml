	    <![CDATA["I have nothing to make me miserable,&quot; she said, getting calmer; &quot;but can you understand that everything has become hateful, loathsome, coarse to me, and I myself most of all? You can't imagine what loathsome thoughts I have about everything.&quot;

&quot;Why, whatever loathsome thoughts can you have?&quot; asked Dolly, smiling.

&quot;The most utterly loathsome and coarse; I can't tell you. It's not unhappiness, or low spirits, but much worse. As though everything that was good in me was all hidden away, and nothing was left but the most loathsome." -- Leo Tolstoy]]>
