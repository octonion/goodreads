	    <![CDATA["It had flaws, but what does that matter when it comes to matters of the heart? We love what we love. Reason does not enter into it. In many ways, unwise love is the truest love. Anyone can love a thing &lt;i&gt;because&lt;/i&gt;. That's as easy as putting a penny in your pocket. But to love something &lt;i&gt;despite&lt;/i&gt;. To know the flaws and love them too. That is rare and pure and perfect." -- Patrick Rothfuss]]>

	    <![CDATA["It's the questions we can't answer that teach us the most. They teach us how to think. If you give a man an answer, all he gains is a little fact. But give him a question and he'll look for his own answers." -- Patrick Rothfuss]]>
