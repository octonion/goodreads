	    <![CDATA["In the nineteeth century, knitting was prescribed to women as a cure for nervousness and hysteria. Many new knitters find this sort of hard to believe because, until you get good at it, knitting seems to cause those ailments.

&lt;i&gt;The twitch above my right eye will disappear with knitting practice&lt;/i&gt;." -- Stephanie Pearl-McPhee]]>

	    <![CDATA["&lt;b&gt;Advice for New Knitters&lt;/b&gt;

When choosing a pattern, look for ones that have words such as &quot;simple&quot;, &quot;basic&quot;, and &quot;easy&quot;. If you see the words &quot;intriguing&quot;, &quot;challenging&quot;, or &quot;intricate&quot;, look elsewhere. 

If you happen across a pattern that says &quot;heirloom&quot;, slowly put down the pattern and back away.

&lt;i&gt;&quot;Heirloom&quot; is knitting code for &quot;This pattern is so difficult that you would consider death a relief&quot;." -- Stephanie Pearl-McPhee]]>

	    <![CDATA["As long as there has been knitting there have been battles about it. There are self-declared &quot;yarn snobs,&quot; who frown on using anything but natural fibers; &quot;gauge snobs&quot;, who wouldn't be caught dead with chunky yarn; and &quot;experience snobs&quot;, who claim you can't declare yourself a real knitter until you abandon novelty yarns. The truth is that the knitting world is a tiny metaphor for the real world. It takes all kinds.

&lt;i&gt;I will not allow myself to feel bad if someone disapproves of my knitting. I will also resist the urge to stuff his mailbox full of chunky acrylic fun fur at 3:00 am.&lt;/i&gt;" -- Stephanie Pearl-McPhee]]>
