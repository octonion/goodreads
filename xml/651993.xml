	    <![CDATA["The Paradoxical Commandments

People are illogical, unreasonable, and self-centered.
Love them anyway.

If you do good, people will accuse you of selfish ulterior motives.
Do good anyway.

If you are successful, you will win false friends and true enemies.
Succeed anyway.

The good you do today will be forgotten tomorrow.
Do good anyway.

Honesty and frankness make you vulnerable.
Be honest and frank anyway.

The biggest men and women with the biggest ideas can be shot down by the smallest men and women with the smallest minds.
Think big anyway.

People favor underdogs but follow only top dogs.
Fight for a few underdogs anyway.

What you spend years building may be destroyed overnight.
Build anyway.

People really need help but may attack you if you do help them.
Help people anyway.

Give the world the best you have and you'll get kicked in the teeth.
Give the world the best you have anyway." -- Kent M. Keith]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Whether I like it or not, most of my images of what various historical periods feel, smell, or sound like were acquired well before I set foot in any history class. They came from Margaret Mitchell, from Anya Seton, from M.M. Kaye, and a host of other authors, in their crackly plastic library bindings. Whether historians acknowledge it or not, scholarly history’s illegitimate cousin, the historical novel, plays a profound role in shaping widely held conceptions of historical realities." -- Lauren Willig]]>

	    <![CDATA["Royse Bergon:  &quot;I've seen your integrity in action.  It...widened my world.  I'd been raised by my father, who is a prudent, cautious man, always looking for men's hidden, selfish motivations.  No one can cheat him.  But I've seen him cheat himself.  If you understand what I mean.&quot;
Caz:  &quot;Yes.&quot;
R.B.:  &quot;It was very foolish of you to attack that vile Roknari galley-man.&quot;
Caz:  &quot;Yes.&quot;
R.B.:  &quot;And yet, I think, given the same circumstances you would do it again.&quot;
Caz: &quot;Knowing what I know now...it would be harder.  But I would hope... I would pray, Royse, that the gods would still lend me such foolishness in my need.&quot;
R.B:  &quot;What is this astonishing foolishness, that shines brighter than all my father's gold?  Can you teach me to be such a fool, too, Caz?&quot;
Caz:  &quot;Oh,&quot; &quot;I'm sure of it." -- Lois McMaster Bujold]]>
