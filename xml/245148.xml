	    <![CDATA["Whether we're talking about fish species, pigs, or some other eaten animal, is such suffering the most important thing in the world? Obviously not. But that's not the question. Is it more important that sushi, bacon, or chicken nuggets? That's the question." -- Jonathan Safran Foer]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The word Fascism has now no meaning except in so far as it signifies &quot;something not desirable&quot;...In the case of a word like democracy, not only is there no agreed definition, but the attempt to make one is resisted from all sides.  It is almost universally felt that when we call a country democratic we are praising it: consequently the defenders of every kind of regime claim that it is a democracy, and fear that they might have to stop using the word if it were tied down to any one meaning." -- George Orwell]]>

	    <![CDATA["Voi che vivete sicuri
Nelle vostre tiepide case
oi che trovate tornando a sera
Il cibo caldo e visi amici
Considerati si questo è un uomo
Che lavora nel gango
Che non conosce pace
Che lotta por mezzo pane
Che muore per un sì o per un no
Considerate se questa é una donna
Senza caplli e senza nome
Senza più forza di ricordare
Vuoti gli occhi e freddo il grembo
Come una rana d'inverno
Meditate che questo è stato
Vi comando queste parole
Scolpitele nem vuostro cuore
Stando in casa andando per via
Coricandovi alzandovi
Ripetelete ai vostri figli
O vi si sfaccia la casa
La malattia vi impedisca
I vostri nati torcano il viso da voi." -- Primo Levi]]>
