	    <![CDATA["A mother's love for her child is like nothing else in the world. It knows no law, no pity. It dares all things and crushes down remorselessly all that stands in its path. 

&lt;i&gt;-The Last Seance (from The Hound of Death and Other Stories, also Double Sin and Other Stories)&lt;/i&gt;" -- Agatha Christie]]>

	    <![CDATA["I carried [Rudy] softly through the broken street...with him I tried a little harder [at comforting]. I watched the contents of his soul for a moment and saw a black-painted boy calling the name Jesse Owens as he ran through an imaginary tape. I saw him hip-deep in some icy water, chasing a book, and I saw a boy lying in bed, imagining how a kiss would taste from his glorious next-door neighbor. He does something to me, that boy. Every time. It's his only detriment. He steps on my heart. He makes me cry." -- Markus Zusak]]>
