	    <![CDATA["Marriage isn't a love affair.  It isn't even a honeymoon.  It's a job.  A long hard job, at which both partners have to work, harder than they've worked at anything in their lives before.  If it's a good marriage, it changes, it evolves, but it does on getting better.  I've seen it with my own mother and father.  But a bad marriage can dissolve in a welter of resentment and acrimony.  I've seen that, too, in my own miserable and disastrous attempt at making another person happy.  And it's never one person's fault.  It's the sum total of a thousand little irritations, disagreements, idiotic details that in a sound alliance would simply be disregarded, or forgotten in the healing act of making love.  Divorce isn't a cure, it's a surgical operation, even if there are no children to consider." -- Rosamunde Pilcher]]>
