	    <![CDATA["For the first twenty years of my life, I rocked myself to sleep.  It was a harmless enough hobby, but eventually, I had to give it up.  Throughout the next twenty-two years I lay still and discovered that after a few minutes I could drop off with no problem.  Follow seven beers with a couple of scotches and a thimble of good marijuana, and it’s funny how sleep just sort of comes on its own.  Often I never even made it to the bed.  I’d squat down to pet the cat and wake up on the floor eight hours later, having lost a perfectly good excuse to change my clothes.  I’m now told that this is not called “going to sleep” but rather “passing out,” a phrase that carries a distinct hint of judgment." -- David Sedaris]]>
