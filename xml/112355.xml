		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I'd written Smashed not because I was ambitious and not because writing down my feelings was cathartic (it felt more like playing one's own neurosurgeon sans anesthesia).  No.  I'd made a habit--and eventually a profession--of memoir because I hail from one of those families where shows of emotions are discouraged." -- Koren Zailckas]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["There's a limit to my patience with anything that smacks of metaphysics.  I squirm at the mention of &quot;mind expansion&quot; or &quot;warm healing energy.&quot; I don't like drum circles, public nudity or strangers touching my feet." -- Koren Zailckas]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["My demeanor isn't that of a woman enraged. To see me slumped, glassy-eyed, holding a sandwich someone has cut for me into four &quot;manageable&quot; pieces, a person might tell you I look much more like a woman subdued." -- Koren Zailckas]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["My boyfriends have all been as stoical as queen's guards. They'd been patient, committed, and dispassionate, and I'd had to really debase myself to extract any emotion, either grin or grimace, from them." -- Koren Zailckas]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["These worst mornings with cold floors and hot windows and merciless light - the soul's certainty that the day will have to be not traversed but sort of climbed, vertically, and then that going to sleep again at the end of it will be like falling, again, off something tall and sheet." -- David Foster Wallace]]>
