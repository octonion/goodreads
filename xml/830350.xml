	    <![CDATA["Take almost any path you please, and ten to one it carries you down in a dale, and leaves you there by a pool in the stream.  There is magic in it.  Let the most absent-minded of men be plunged in his deepest reveries--stand that man on his legs, set his feet a-going, and he will infallibly lead you to water, if water there be in all that region.  Should you ever be athirst in the great American desert, try this experiment, if your caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical professor.  Yes, as every one knows, meditation and water are wedded for ever." -- Herman Melville]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["In the long run, all wrongs are righted, every minus is equalized with a plus, the columns are totaled and the totals are found correct.  But that's in the long run.  We must live in the short run and matters are often unjust there.  The compensating for us of the universe makes all the accounts come out even, but they grind down the good as well as the wicked in the process." -- Michael Connelly]]>
