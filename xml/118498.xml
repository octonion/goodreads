	    <![CDATA["	“Tortolita, let me tell you a story,” Estevan said.  “This is a South American, wild Indian story about heaven and hell.”  Mrs. Parsons made a prudish face, and Estevan went on.  “If you go visit hell, you will see a room like this kitchen.  There is a pot of delicious stew on the table, with the most delicate aroma you can imagine.  All around, people sit, like us.  Only they are dying of starvation.  They are jibbering and jabbering,” he looked extra hard at Mrs. Parsons, “but they cannot get a bit of this wonderful stew God has made for them.  Now, why is that?”
	“Because they’re choking?  For all eternity?” Lou Ann asked.  Hell, for Lou Ann, would naturally be a place filled with sharp objects and small round foods.
	“No,” he said.  “Good guess, but no.  They are starving because they only have spoons with very long handles.  As long as that.”  He pointed to the mop, which I had forgotten to put away.  “With these ridiculous, terrible spoons, the people in hell can reach into the pot but they cannot put the food in their mouths.  Oh, how hungry they are!  Oh, how they swear and curse each other!” he said, looking again at Virgie.  He was enjoying this.
	“Now,” he went on, “you can go and visit heaven.  What?  You see a room just like the first one, the same table, the same pot of stew, the same spoons as long as a sponge mop.  But these people are all happy and fat.”
	“Real fat, or do you mean just well-fed?” Lou Ann asked.
	“Just well-fed,” he said.  “Perfectly, magnificently well-fed, and very happy.  Why do you think?”
	He pinched up a chunk of pineapple in his chopsticks, neat as you please, and reached all the way across the table to offer it to Turtle.  She took it like a newborn bird." -- Barbara Kingsolver]]>
