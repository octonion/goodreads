		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Yet, when these facts are seen side by side with other facts in the case, it is difficult not to become lost in superstitious awe.  Their very absurdity seems to prohibit the use of the words 'chance' and 'coincidence.' For the sceptic there remains only one consolation: if there should be such a thing as superhuman Law, it is administered with sub-human inefficiency." -- Eric Ambler]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I studied Comparative Literature at Cornell. Structuralism was real big then. The idea of reading and writing as being this language game. There's a lot of appeal to that. It's nice to think of it as this playful kind of thing. But I think that another way to look at it is &quot;Look, I just want to be sincere. I want to write something and make you feel something and maybe you will go out and do something.&quot; And it seems that the world is in such bad shape now that we don't have time to do nothing but language games. That's how it seems to me." -- William T. Vollmann]]>
