	    <![CDATA["Books are the carriers of civilization. Without books, history is silent, literature dumb, science crippled, thought and speculation at a standstill.  Without books, the development of civilization would have been impossible.  They are engines of change (as the poet said), windows on the world and lighthouses erected in the sea of time.  They are companions, teachers, magicians, bankers of the treasures of the mind. Books are humanity in print.

[&lt;i&gt;Bulletin of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences&lt;/i&gt;, Vol. 34, No. 2 (Nov. 1980), pp. 16-32]" -- Barbara Tuchman]]>
