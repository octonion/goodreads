	    <![CDATA["Yet each man kills the thing he loves
By each let this be heard
Some do it with a bitter look
Some with a flattering word
The coward does it with a kiss
The brave man with a sword" -- Oscar Wilde]]>

	    <![CDATA["For long the two enemies looked at one another, Hook shuddering slightly, and Peter with the strange smile upon his face.
&quot;So, Pan,&quot; said Hook at last, &quot;this is all your doing.&quot;
&quot;Ay, James Hook,&quot; came the stern answer, &quot;it is all my doing.&quot;
&quot;Proud and insolent youth,&quot; said Hook, &quot;prepare to meet thy doom.&quot;
&quot;Dark and sinister man,â€œFor long the two enemies looked at one another, Hook shuddering slightly, and Peter with the strange smile upon his face.
&quot;Dark and sinister man,&quot; Peter answered, &quot;have at thee." -- J.M. Barrie]]>

	    <![CDATA["There is nothing in this life that can destroy you but yourself. Bad things happen to everyone, but when they do, you can't just fall apart and die. You have  to fight back. If you don't, you're the one who loses in the end. But if you do keep going and fight back, you win." -- Alexandra Monir]]>
