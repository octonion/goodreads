	    <![CDATA["June is gone. For the first time, the enormity of that hits me. Every muscle aches, my heart most of all. I am throbbing with how much I miss her. It hurts worse than anything. I don't know how I'm supposed to be expected to live day to day carrying this kind of pain. I don't know how I'm supposed to go out there, spread her ashes, and let her go.
I want to stop running away from everything.
I want to find something to run toward." -- Hannah Harrington]]>

	    <![CDATA["There is an hour, a minute - you will remember it forever - when you know instinctively on the basis of the most inconsequential evidence, that something is wrong. You don't know - can't know - that it is the first of a series of &quot;wrongful&quot; events that will culminate in the utter devastation of your life as you have known it." -- Joyce Carol Oates]]>
