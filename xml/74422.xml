	    <![CDATA["There are two kinds of truth: the truth that lights the way and the truth that warms the heart. The first of these is science, and the second is art. Neither is independent of the other or more important than the other. Without art science would be as useless as a pair of high forceps in the hands of a plumber. Without science art would become a crude mess of folklore and emotional quackery. The truth of art keeps science from becoming inhuman, and the truth of science keeps art from becoming ridiculous.&quot;

(&lt;i&gt;Great Thought&lt;/i&gt;, February 19, 1938)" -- Raymond Chandler]]>
