		<description>
	    <![CDATA["My books happen. They tend to blast in from nowhere, seize me by the throat, and howl 'Write me! Write me now!' But they rarely stand still long enough for me to see what and who they are, before they hurtle away again. And so I spend a lot of time running after them, like a thrown rider after an escaped horse, saying 'Wait for me! Wait for me!' and waving my notebook in the air." -- Robin McKinley]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["When you write your first novel you don't really know what you're doing.  There may be writers out there who are brilliant, incisive and in control from their first 'Once upon a time'.  I'm not one of them.  Every once upon a time for me is another experience of white-water rafting in a leaky inner tube.  And I have this theory that while the Story Council has its faults, it does have some idea that if books are going to get written, authors have to be able to write them." -- Robin McKinley]]>
