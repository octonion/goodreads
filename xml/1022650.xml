  Bracken looked into her calf's eyes. &quot;Man? Man is something you must always fear.&quot;
  &quot;But why must I fear him?&quot; asked Rannoch.
  &quot;Because, my little one...man is cruel and cold.  He eats up everything he touches.  He enslaves Lera and breaks the laws of the forest. Because, Rannoch, he is the only creature that hunts without need." -- David Clement-Davies]]>

A light from the shadows shall spring;
Renewed shall be blade that was broken,
The crownless again shall be king." -- J.R.R. Tolkien]]>

Down from the door where it began.

Until it joins some larger way
Where many paths and errands meet.
And whither then? I cannot say" -- J.R.R. Tolkien]]>

	    <![CDATA["I have claimed that Escape is one of the main functions of fairy-stories, and since I do not disapprove of them, it is plain that I do not accept the tone of scorn or pity with which 'Escape' is now so often used.

In western lands beneath the Sun
The flowers may rise in Spring,
The trees may bud, the waters run,
The merry finches sing.
Or there maybe 'tis cloudless night,
And swaying branches bear
The Elven-stars as jewels white
Amid their branching hair.

Though here at journey's end I lie
In darkness buried deep,
Beyond all towers strong and high,
Beyond all mountains steep,
Above all shadows rides the Sun
And Stars for ever dwell:
I will not say the Day is done,
Nor bid the Stars farewell.J." -- J.R.R. Tolkien]]>
