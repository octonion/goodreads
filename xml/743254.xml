	    <![CDATA["I wanted to walk straight on through the red grass and over the edge of the world, which could not be very far away.  The light and air abot me told me that the world ended here:  only the ground and sun and sky were left, and if one went a little farther there would only be sun and sky, and one would float off into them, like the tawny hawks which sailed over our heads making slow shadows on the grass." -- Willa Cather]]>

Boring almost, you might say, if you didn't know about the depths, that is, if you didn't believe they were there." -- Melanie Thernstrom]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I have learned that if you must leave a place that you have lived in and loved and where all your yesteryears are buried deep, leave it any way except a slow way, leave it the fastest way you can.  Never turn back and never believe that an hour you remember is a better hour because it is dead.  Passed years seem safe ones, vanquished ones, while the future lives in a cloud, formidable from a distance." -- Beryl Markham]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["When I am lonely for boys it’s their bodies I miss. I study their hands lifting the cigarettes in the darkness of the movie theaters, the slope of a shoulder, the angle of a hip. Looking at them sideways, I examine them in different lights. My love for them is visual: that is the part of them I would like to possess. Don’t move, I think. Stay like that, let me have that." -- Margaret Atwood]]>

She pined for the girliness of it all, the unplanned, improvisational laziness. She wanted to soak the words 'time management' out of her lexicon. She wanted to hand over, to yield, to let herself float down the unchartered beautiful fertile musky swamp of life, where creativity and eroticism and deep intelligence dwell." -- Rebecca Wells]]>
