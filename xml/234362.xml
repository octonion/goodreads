	    <![CDATA["What was it about Eric? He was handsome and talented, yeah. But lots of guys were. She had adored Billy Klein back in Alabama the summer before, and she had even felt attracted to him, but it wasn't like this.

If Bridget were God, she would have made it against the law for you to feel that way about someone without them having to feel it for you right back." -- Ann Brashares]]>
