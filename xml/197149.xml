The Christian god may exist; so may the gods of Olympus, or of ancient Egypt, or of Babylon. But no one of these hypotheses is more probable than any other: they lie outside the region of even probable knowledge, and therefore there is no reason to consider any of them." -- Bertrand Russell ]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The only rule that ever made sense to me I learned from a history, not an economics, professor at Wharton. &quot;Fear,&quot; he used to say, &quot;fear is the most valuable commodity in the universe.&quot; That blew me away. &quot;Turn on the TV,&quot; he'd say. &quot;What are you seeing? People selling their products? No. People selling the fear of you having to live without their products.&quot; Fuckin' A, was he right. Fear of aging, fear of loneliness, fear of poverty, fear of failure. Fear is the most basic emotion we have. Fear is primal. Fear sells." -- Max Brooks]]>

So we can only pray, if we were Hindus, not that a Christian should become a Hindu; but our innermost prayer should be that a Hindu should become a better Hindu, a Muslim a better Muslim, and a Christian a better Christian." -- Mahatma Gandhi ]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The reader must come armed , in a serious state of intellectual readiness. This is not easy because he comes to the text alone. In reading, one's responses are isolated, one'sintellect thrown back on its own resourses. To be confronted by the cold abstractions of printed sentences is to look upon language bare, without the assistance of either beauty or community. Thus, reading is by its nature a serious business. It is also, of course, an essentially rational activity." -- Neil Postman]]>
