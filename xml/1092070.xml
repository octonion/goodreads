	    <![CDATA["The major problem&amp;mdash;&lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt; of the major problems, for there are several&amp;mdash;one of the many major problems with governing people is that of whom you get to do it; or rather of who manages to get people to let them do it to them. 
To summarize: it is a well-known fact that those people who must &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; to rule people are, ipso facto, those least suited to do it. 
To summarize the summary: anyone who is capable of getting themselves made President should on no account be allowed to do the job." -- Douglas Adams]]>

Infinite variations on that theme. Doesn't sound so bad, does it? Well, trust me." -- Glen Duncan]]>
