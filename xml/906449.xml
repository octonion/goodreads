	    <![CDATA["There is a saying that to understand is to forgive, but that is an error, so Papa used to say. You must forgive in order to understand.

If you forgive, he would say, you may indeed still not understand, but you will be ready to understand, and that is the posture of grace." -- Marilynne Robinson ]]>
