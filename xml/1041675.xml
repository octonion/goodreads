		<description>
	    <![CDATA["She didn't understand that. &quot;How can anyone be afraid of love?&quot;
&quot;How can they not?&quot; His face was completely aghast. &quot;When you love someone... truly love them, friend or lover, you lay your heart open to them. You give them a part of yourself that you give to no one else, and you let them inside a part of you that only they can hurt—you literally hand them the razor with a map of where to cut deepest and most painfully on your heart and soul. And when they do strike, it's crippling—like having your heart carved out. It leaves you naked and exposed, wondering what you did to make them want to hurt you so badly when all you did was love them. What is so wrong with you that no one can keep faith with you? That no one can love you? To have it happen once is bad enough... but to have it repeated? Who in their right mind would not be terrified of that?" -- Sherrilyn Kenyon]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["It's easy to look at people and make quick judgments about them, their present and their past, but you'd be amazed at the pain and tears a single smile hides. What a person shows to the world is only one tiny facet of the iceberg hidden from sight. And more often then not, it's lined with cracks and scars that go all the way to the foundation of their soul." -- Sherrilyn Kenyon]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I lifted my face to meet the kiss, wanting the comfort of his touch as much as I was willing to provide the comfort of mine. The contact was sweet and soft, yet at the same time desperate.

It was Zane who pulled away first. &quot;Danica, I think...&quot; He trailed off and kissed me again, this time briefly, just the barest touch of lips to lips. &quot;I love you.&quot;

From a man who frequently uttered eloquent speeches, the tentative declaration was not the most flattering of compliments-especially when every movement he made and look he cast my way had shown the long truth before now.

But coming from the serpent who had once informed me that he did not love me and did not think he ever could, whose cool, polished words could cut to the bone and freeze the Earth's frozen molten blood-whose eyes right now were just a bid dazed, and whose expression was as open and startled as I had ever seen it-the words were more than enough.

&quot;I know,&quot; I answered. Then, soft but certain, I answered, &quot;I love you too.&quot;

His smile matched mine and said the same as mine:  I know." -- Amelia Atwater-Rhodes]]>

	    <![CDATA["What could a mortal say to the merciless Fate?
I forced myself to my feet.  
&lt;i&gt;A'le-Ahnleh&lt;/i&gt; was the traditional end to a prayer.  By the will of Fate.
&quot;&lt;i&gt;A'le-la,&lt;/i&gt;&quot; I whispered defiantly.
By &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; will." -- Amelia Atwater-Rhodes]]>
