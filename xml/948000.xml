a

A boy that I'm &lt;b&gt;seriously, deeply, madly, incredibly, and undeniably&lt;/b&gt; in &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;love&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; with.
And he taught me the most important thing of &lt;b&gt;all&lt;/b&gt;...

Bom Bom...
Bom Bom...
Bom Bom...

Do you &lt;i&gt;hear&lt;/i&gt; that?
That's the sound of my heart beating...

Bom Bom...
Bom Bom...
Bom Bom...

Do you &lt;i&gt;hear&lt;/i&gt; that? That's the sound of &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; heart beating.

It was the &lt;b&gt;first&lt;/b&gt; day of October. I was wearing my &lt;b&gt;blue&lt;/b&gt; sweater, you know the one I bought at &lt;b&gt;Dillard’s?&lt;/b&gt; The one with a double knitted &lt;b&gt;hem&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;holes&lt;/b&gt; in the &lt;b&gt;ends&lt;/b&gt; of the &lt;b&gt;sleeves&lt;/b&gt; that &lt;b&gt;I&lt;/b&gt; could poke my &lt;b&gt;thumbs&lt;/b&gt; through when it was cold but I didn't feel like wearing &lt;b&gt;gloves&lt;/b&gt;? It was the &lt;b&gt;same&lt;/b&gt; sweater you said made my &lt;b&gt;eyes&lt;/b&gt; look like reflections of the &lt;b&gt;stars&lt;/b&gt; on the &lt;b&gt;ocean&lt;/b&gt;.
You promised to love me &lt;b&gt;forever&lt;/b&gt; that night...
and &lt;b&gt;boy&lt;/b&gt;
did &lt;b&gt;you&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;ever!&lt;/b&gt;

It was the &lt;b&gt;first&lt;/b&gt; day of &lt;b&gt;December&lt;/b&gt; this time. I was wearing my &lt;b&gt;blue&lt;/b&gt; sweater, you know the one I bought at &lt;b&gt;Dillard’s?&lt;/b&gt; The one with a double knitted &lt;b&gt;hem&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;holes&lt;/b&gt; in the &lt;b&gt;ends&lt;/b&gt; of the &lt;b&gt;sleeves&lt;/b&gt; that &lt;b&gt;I&lt;/b&gt; could poke my &lt;b&gt;thumbs&lt;/b&gt; through when it was cold but I didn't feel like wearing &lt;b&gt;gloves&lt;/b&gt;? It was the &lt;b&gt;same&lt;/b&gt; sweater you said made my &lt;b&gt;eyes&lt;/b&gt; look like reflections of the &lt;b&gt;stars&lt;/b&gt; on the &lt;b&gt;ocean&lt;/b&gt;. 
I told you &lt;b&gt;I&lt;/b&gt; was three weeks &lt;b&gt;late&lt;/b&gt;
You &lt;b&gt;said&lt;/b&gt; it was fate.
You promised to love me forever that night...
and &lt;b&gt;boy&lt;/b&gt;
did &lt;b&gt;you&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;ever!&lt;/b&gt;

It was the first day of May. I was wearing my &lt;b&gt;blue&lt;/b&gt; sweater, although &lt;b&gt;this&lt;/b&gt; time the double stitched &lt;b&gt;hem&lt;/b&gt; was &lt;b&gt;worn&lt;/b&gt;
and the &lt;b&gt;strength&lt;/b&gt; of each thread &lt;b&gt;tested&lt;/b&gt; as they were pulled &lt;b&gt;tight&lt;/b&gt; against my &lt;b&gt;growing belly. You&lt;/b&gt; know the one. The same one &lt;b&gt;I&lt;/b&gt; bought at &lt;b&gt;Dillard’s&lt;/b&gt;? The one with &lt;b&gt;holes&lt;/b&gt; in the &lt;b&gt;ends&lt;/b&gt; of the
&lt;b&gt;sleeves&lt;/b&gt; that I could poke my &lt;b&gt;thumbs&lt;/b&gt; through when it was cold but I didn't feel like wearing &lt;b&gt;gloves&lt;/b&gt;? It was the same sweater you said made my &lt;b&gt;eyes&lt;/b&gt; look like reflections of the &lt;b&gt;stars&lt;/b&gt; on the
&lt;b&gt;ocean&lt;/b&gt;.

The &lt;b&gt;SAME&lt;/b&gt; sweater you &lt;b&gt;RIPPED&lt;/b&gt; off of my body as you &lt;b&gt;shoved&lt;/b&gt; me to the 
floor,
calling me a &lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;whore&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;,
telling me
you didn't &lt;b&gt;love&lt;/b&gt; me
anymore.

Bom Bom...
Bom Bom...
Bom Bom...

Do you &lt;i&gt;hear&lt;/i&gt; that? That's the sound of my heart beating.

Bom Bom...
Bom Bom...
Bom Bom...

Do you &lt;i&gt;hear&lt;/i&gt; that? That's the sound of &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; heart
beating.

(There is a long silence as she clasps her hands to her stomach, tears streaming down her face)

Do you &lt;i&gt;hear&lt;/i&gt; that? Of course you don't. That's the silence
of my womb.

Because you
&lt;b&gt;RIPPED
OFF
MY
SWEATER!&lt;/b&gt;" -- Colleen Hoover]]>

	    <![CDATA["There are three questions every woman should be able to answer yes to before they commit to a man. If you answer no to any of the three questions, run like hell.&quot;
[...]
&quot;Does he treat you with respect at all times? That's the first question. The second question is, if he is the exact same person twenty years from now that he is today, would you still want to marry him? And finally, does he inspire to be a better person? You find someone you can answer yes to all three, then you've found a good man." -- Colleen Hoover]]>

How do you not fall in love with him? The tears begin flowing just as quickly as they had ceased. I grab yet another tissue. I don't not fall in love with him. I don't not fall in love with him a lot!" -- Colleen Hoover]]>

	    <![CDATA["Butterfly.
What a beautiful word
What a delicate creature.
Delicate like the cruel words that flow right out of your mouths and the food that flies right out of your hands…
Does it make you feel better?
Does it make you feel good ?
Does picking on a girl make you more of a man?
Well, I’m standing up for myself
Like I should have done before
I’m not putting up with your Butterfly anymore.&quot;
(Kiersten slides the sack off her wrist and opens it, pulling out a handful of hand-made butterflies. She takes the microphone out of the stand and begins walking down the stairs as she continues speaking.)
“I’d like to extend to others what others have extended to me.”
(She walks up to Mrs. Brill first and holds out a butterfly)
“Butterfly you, Mrs. Brill.”
(Mrs. Brill smiles at her and takes the butterfly out of her hands. Lake laughs out loud and I have to nudge her to get her to be quiet. Kiersten walks around the room, passing out butterflies to several of the students, including the three from the lunchroom.)
“Butterfly you, Mark.
Butterfly you, Brendan.
Butterfly you, Colby.”
(When she finishes passing out the butterflies, she walks back onto the stage and places the microphone back into the stand.)
“I have one thing to say to you
And I’m not referring to the bullies
Or the ones they pursue.
I’m referring to those of you that just stand by
The ones who don’t take up for those of us that cry
Those of you who just…turn a blind eye.
After all it’s not you it’s happening to
You aren’t the one being bullied
And you aren’t the one being rude
It isn’t your hand that’s throwing the food
But…it is your mouth not speaking up
It is your feet not taking a stand
It is your arm not lending a hand
It is your heart
Not giving a damn.
So take up for yourself
Take up for your friends
I challenge you to be someone
Who doesn’t give in.
Don’t give in.
Don’t let them win." -- Colleen Hoover]]>
