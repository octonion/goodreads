	    <![CDATA["That is at bottom the only courage that is demanded of us: to have courage for the most strange, the most singular and the most inexplicable that we may encounter. That mankind has in this sense been cowardly has done life endless harm; the experiences that are called &quot;visions,&quot; the whole so-called &quot;spirit-world,&quot; death, all those things that are so closely akin to us, have by daily parrying been so crowded out of life that the senses with which we could have grasped them are atrophied. To say nothing of God." -- Rainer Maria Rilke]]>
