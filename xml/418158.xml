	    <![CDATA["To my unsuspecting love.
When I look into your eyes, I lose all sense of time and place. Reason robbed, clear thought erased, I am lost in the paradise I find within your gaze.
I long to touch your blushing cheek, to whisper in your ear how I adore you, how I have lost my heart to you, how I cannot bear the thought of living without you.
To be so near to you without touching you is agony. Your blindness to my feelings is a daily torment, and I feel driven to the edge of madness by my love for you.
Where is your compassion when I need it most? Open your eyes , Love, and see what is right before you: that I am not merely a friend, but a man deeply, desperately , in love with you.
Longing for you." -- Julianne Donaldson]]>

	    <![CDATA["Love you!   Girl, you're in the very core of my heart.   I hold you there like a jewel.   Didn't I promise you I'd never tell you a lie? Love you!   I love you with all there is of me to love.   Heart, soul, brain.   Every fibre of body and spirit thrilling to the sweetness of you.   There's nobody in the world for me but you, Valancy." -- L.M.
