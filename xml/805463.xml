&quot;But you'll always be Butch to us,&quot; Rhage cut in. &quot;As well as hard-ass. Smart-ass. Royal pain in the ass. You know, whatever the situation calls for. I think as long as there's an ASS in there, it'll be accurate.&quot;

	    <![CDATA["There aren't any syringes.&quot; Red Sox came over and held a sterile pack out. When she tried to take it from him, he kept a grip on the thing. &quot;I know you'll use this wisely.&quot;
&quot;Wisely?&quot; She snapped the syringe out of his hand. &quot;No, I'm going to poke him in the eye with it. Because that's what they trained me to do in medical school." -- J.R. Ward]]>

Everyone in the room turned to the blond-and-black haired guy, who was propped in the corner, massive arms over his chest.

What,&quot; he said. &quot;Look, it's not Mary Tyler Moore, 'kay? So you can 't give me shit.&quot;

Vishous, the one with the black glove on his hand, glared across the room.  &quot;It's worse than Mary Tyler Moore.  And to call you and idiot would be an insult to half-wits around the world.&quot;

Are you kidding me?  Bette Midler rocks. And I love the ocean.  Sue me.&quot;

Vishous glanced at the king. &quot;You told me I could beat him.  You promised.&quot;

As soon as you come home,&quot; Wrath said as he got to his feet, &quot;we'll hang him up by his armpits in the gym and you can use him as a punching bag.&quot;

Thank you, baby Jesus.&quot;

Blond-and-Black shook his head. &quot;I swear, one of these days I'm going to leave.&quot;

As one, the Brothers all pointed to the open door and let silence speak for itself.

You guys suck." -- J.R. Ward]]>
