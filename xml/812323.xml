		<description>
	    <![CDATA["&lt;i&gt; Ours is a bourgeois civilization. I am not using this term in its Marxian sense. &lt;/i&gt; Chicken! &lt;i&gt; In the vocabularies of modern art and religion it is bourgeois to consider that the universe was made for our safe use and to give us comfort, ease, and support. Light travels at a quarter of a million miles per second so that we can see to comb our hair or read in the paper that ham hocks are cheaper than yesterday. De Tocqueville considered the impulse toward well-being as one of the strongest impulses of a democratic society. He can't be blamed for underestimating the destructive powers generated by this same impulse. &lt;/i&gt;" -- Saul Bellow]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The United States has 250 Billion tons of recoverable coal reserves - enough to last 100 years even at double the current rate of consumption.' We humans have inhabited the earth for many thousands of years, and now we can look forward to surviving for another hundred by doubling our consumption of coal? This is national security? The world-ending fire of industrial fundamentalism may already be burning in our furnaces and engines, but if it will burn for a hundred more years, that will be fine. Surely it would be better to intend straightforwardly to contain the fire and eventually put it out! But once greed has been made an honorable motive, then you have an economy without limits. It has no place for temperance or thrift or the ecological law of return. It will do anything. It is monstrous by definition." -- Wendell Berry]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["If a man is offered a fact which goes against his instincts, he will scrutinize it closely, and unless the evidence is overwhelming, he will refuse to believe it. If, on the other hand, he is offered something which affords a reason for acting in accordance to his instincts, he will accept it even on the slightest evidence. The origin of myths is explained in this way." -- Bertrand Russell]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["In the lobby, an old woman with legs wrapped in elastic bandages mopped the floor with filthy water. She kept missing the same spot, over and over. There was the overpowering smell of disinfectant, bad tobacco, and wet wool. This was the smell of Russia indoors, the smell of the woman in front of you on line, the smell of every elevator. Near an abandoned newsstand, dozens of overcoats hung on long rows of pegs, somber and dark, lightly steaming, like nags in a stable." -- David Remnick]]>

Our generation has seen the decisive victory of free-market principles over planned economies. So we stick with this belief, largely oblivious to emerging evidence that while free markets beat planned economies, there may be room for a modification that is even better." -- Andy Grove]]>

	    <![CDATA["[author:Luther Burbank|227459] was born in a brick farmhouse in Lancaster Mass,
he walked through the woods one winter
crunching through the shinycrusted snow
stumbling into a little dell where a warm spring was
and found the grass green and weeds sprouting
and skunk cabbage pushing up a potent thumb,
He went home and sat by the stove and read [author:Darwin|12793]
Struggle for Existence Origin of Species Natural
Selection that wasn't what they taught in church,
so [author:Luther Burbank|227459] ceased to believe moved to Lunenburg,
found a seedball in a potato plant
sowed the seed and cashed in on [author:Darwin|12793]â€™s Natural Selection
on [author:Spencer|52666] and [author:Huxley|17171]
with the Burbank potato.

Young man go west;
[author:Luther Burbank|227459] went to Santa Rosa
full of his dream of green grass in winter ever-
blooming flowers ever-
bearing berries; [author:Luther Burbank|227459]
could cash in on Natural Selection [author:Luther Burbank|227459]
carried his apocalyptic dream of green grass in winter
and seedless berries and stoneless plums and thornless roses brambles cactusâ€”
winters were bleak in that bleak
brick farmhouse in bleak Massachusettsâ€”
out to sunny Santa Rosa;
and he was a sunny old man
where roses bloomed all year
everblooming everbearing
hybrids.

America was hybrid
America could cash in on Natural Selection.
He was an infidel he believed in [author:Darwin|12793] and Natural
Selection and the influence of the mighty dead
and a good firm shipperâ€™s fruit
suitable for canning.
He was one of the grand old men until the churches
and the congregations
got wind that he was an infidel and believed
in [author:Darwin|12793].
[author:Luther Burbank|227459] had never a thought of evil,
selected improved hybrids for America
those sunny years in Santa Rosa.
But he brushed down a waspâ€™s nest that time;
he wouldnâ€™t give up [author:Darwin|12793] and Natural Selection
and they stung him and he died
puzzled.
They buried him under a cedartree.
His favorite photograph
was of a little tot
standing beside a bed of hybrid
everblooming double Shasta daisies
with never a thought of evil
And Mount Shasta
in the background, used to be a volcano
but they donâ€™t have volcanos
any more." -- John Dos Passos]]>
