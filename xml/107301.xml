		<description>
	    <![CDATA["[T]he scripture worshippers put the writings ahead of God.  Instead of interpreting God's actions in nature, for example, they interpret nature in the light of the Scripture.  Nature says the rock is billions of years old, but the book says different, so even though men wrote the book, and God made the rock and God gave us minds that have found ways to tell how old it is, we still choose to believe the Scripture." -- Sheri S.

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["To me, the conclusion that the public has the ultimate responsibility for the behavior of even the biggest businesses is empowering and hopeful, rather than disappointing. My conclusion is not a moralistic one about who is right or wrong, admirable or selfish, a good guy or a bad guy. My conclusion is instead a prediction, based on what I have seen happening in the past. Businesses have changed when the public came to expect and require different behavior, to reward businesses for behavior that the public wanted, and to make things difficult for businesses practicing behaviors that the public didn't want. I predict that in the future, just as in the past, changes in public attitudes will be essential for changes in businesses' environmental practices." -- Jared Diamond]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["All over the ancient world populations were now set against populations, as men were set against women and against other men. Wandering over the width and breadth of this disintegrating world, masses of refugees were everywhere fleeing their homelands, desperately searching for a haven, for a safe place to go.

But there was no such place left in their new world. For this was now a world where, having violently deprived the Goddess and the female half of humanity of all power, gods and men of war ruled. It was a world in which the Blade, and not the Chalice, would henceforth be supreme, a world in which peace and harmony would be found only in the myths and legends of a long lost past." -- Riane Eisler]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["A God who kept tinkering with the universe was absurd; a God  
who interfered with human freedom and creativity was a tyrant. If God is  
seen as a self in a world of his own, an ego that
relates to a thought, a cause separate from its effect, he becomes a  
being, not Being itself. An omnipotent, all‐knowing tyrant is not so  
different from earthly dictators who make everything and
everybody mere cogs in the machine which they controlled. An atheism  
that rejects such a God is amply justified." -- Karen Armstrong]]>

	    <![CDATA["As they passed the rows of houses they saw through the open doors that men were sweeping and dusting and washing dishes, while the women sat around in groups, gossiping and laughing.

What has happened?' the Scarecrow asked a sad-looking man with a bushy beard, who wore an apron and was wheeling a baby carriage along the sidewalk.

Why, we've had a revolution, your Majesty -- as you ought to know very well,' replied the man; 'and since you went away the women have been running things to suit themselves.  I'm glad you have decided to come back and restore order, for doing housework and minding the children is wearing out the strength of every man in the Emerald City.'

Hm!' said the Scarecrow, thoughtfully.  'If it is such hard work as you say, how did the women manage it so easily?'

I really do not know,' replied the man, with a deep sigh.  'Perhaps the women are made of cast-iron." -- L. Frank Baum]]>
