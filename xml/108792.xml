If such things have not been part of your own experience, you probably won't understand what Bastian did next." -- Michael Ende]]>

	    <![CDATA["Once someone dreams a dream, it can't just drop out of existence. But if the dreamer can't remember it, what becomes of it? It lives on in Fantastica, deep under earth. There are forgotten dreams stored in many layers. The deeper one digs, the closer they are. All Fantastica rests on a foundation of forgotten dreams." -- Michael Ende]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["...it's like this. Sometimes, when you've a very long street ahead of you, you think how terribly long it is and feel sure you'll never get it swept. And then you start to hurry. You work faster and faster and every time you look up there seems to be just as much left to sweep as before, and you try even harder, and you panic, and in the end you're out of breath and have to stop--and still the street stretches away in front of you. That's not the way to do it.

You must never think of the whole street at once, understand? You must only concentrate on the next step, the next breath, the next stroke of the broom, and the next, and the next. Nothing else.

That way you enjoy your work, which is important, because then you make a good job of it. And that's how it ought to be.

And all at once, before you know it, you find you've swept the whole street clean, bit by bit. what's more, you aren't out of breath. That's important, too... (28-29)" -- Michael Ende]]>

If you have never wept bitter tears because a wonderful story has come to an end and you must take your leave of the characters with whom you have shared so many adventures, whom you have loved and admired, for whom you have hoped and feared, and without whose company life seems empty and meaningless--

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["People never seemed to notice that, by saving time, they were losing something else.  No one cared to admit that life was becoming ever poorer, bleaker and more monotonous.  The ones who felt this most keenly were the children, because no one had time for them any more.  But time is life itself, and life resides in the human heart.  And the more people saved, the less they had." -- Michael Ende]]>

	    <![CDATA["If you stop to think about it, youâ€™ll have to admit that all the stories in the world consist essentially of twenty-six letters.

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Bastion looked at the book.
'I wonder,' he said to himself, 'what's in a book while it's closed. Oh, I know it's full of letters printed on paper, but all the same, something must be happening, because as soon as I open it, there's a whole story with people I don't know yet and all kinds of adventures, deeds and battles. And sometimes there are storms at sea, or it takes you to strange cities and countries. All those things are somehow shut in a book. Of course you have to read it to find out. But it's already there, that's the funny thing. I just wish I knew how it could be.'
Suddenly an almost festive mood came over him.
He settled himself down, picked up the book, opened it to the first page, and began to read..." -- Michael Ende]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Life holds one great but quite commonplace mystery. Though shared by each of us and known to all, seldom rates a second thought. That mystery, which most of us take for granted and never think twice about, is time.

Calendars and clocks exist to measure time, but that signifies little because we all know that an hour can seem as eternity or pass in a flash, according to how we spend it.

Time is life itself, and life resides in the human heart. " -- Michael Ende]]>

&quot;No,&quot; said the second bark troll, the one with the hole in his chest. &quot;You don't feel a thing. There's just something missing. And once it gets hold of you, something more is missing every day. Soon there won't be anything left of us." -- Michael Ende]]>

Wer niemals heimlich beim Schein einer Taschenlampe unter der Bettdecke gelesen hat, weil Vater oder Mutter oder sonst irgendeine besorgte Person einem das Licht ausknipste mit der gutgemeinten BegrÃ¼ndung, man mÃ¼sse jetzt schlafen, da man doch morgen so frÃ¼h aus den Federn sollte -
Wer niemals offen oder im geheimen bitterliche TrÃ¤nen vergossen hat, weil eine wunderbare Geschichte zu Ende ging und man Abschied nehmen muÃŸte von den Gestalten, mit denen man gemeinsam so viele Abenteuer erlebt hatte, die man liebte und bewunderte, um die man gebangt und fÃ¼r die man gehofft hatte, und ohne deren Gesellschaft einem das Leben leer und sinnlos schien -
Wer nichts von alledem aus eigener Erfahrung kennt, nun, der wird wahrscheinlich nicht begreifen kÃ¶nnen, was Bastian jetzt tat." -- Michael Ende]]>

What will I find on the other side?&quot;
The home of the music you've sometimes faintly heard in the distance, but by then you'll be part of it. You yourself will be a note in its mighty harmonies." -- michael ende]]>

	    <![CDATA["He had been through a good deal in the course of the Great Quest â€” he had seen beautiful things and horrible things â€” but up until now he had not known that one and the same creature can be both, that beauty can be terrifying." -- Michael Ende]]>

	    <![CDATA["He wanted to be loved for being just what he was. In this community of Yskalnari there was harmony, but no love.

He no longer wanted to be the greatest, strongest or cleverest. He had left all that far behind. He longed to be loved just as he was, good or bad, handsome or ugly, clever or stupid, with all his faults - or possibly because of them.

But what was he actually? 

He no longer knew. So much have been given to him in Fantastica, and now, among all these gifts and powers, he could no longer find himself." -- Michael Ende]]>

	    <![CDATA["There were doors that looked like large keyholes, others that resembled the entrances to caves, there were golden doors, some were padded and some were studded with nails, some were paper-thin and others as thick as the doors of treasure houses; there was one that looked like a giant's mouth and another that had to be opened like a drawbridge, one that suggested a big ear and one that was made of gingerbread, one that was shaped like an oven door, and one that had to be unbuttoned." -- Michael Ende]]>
