	    <![CDATA["If you want to understand any woman you must first ask about her mother and then listen carefully. Stories about food show a strong connection. Wistful silences demonstrate unfinished business. The more a daughter knows about the details of her mother's life - without flinching or whining - the stronger the daughter." -- Anita Diamant]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Loneliness is black coffee and late-night television; solitude is herb tea and soft music.  Solitude, quality solitude, is an assertion of self-worth, because only in the stillness can we hear the truth of our own unique voices." -- Pearl Cleage]]>
