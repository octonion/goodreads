	    <![CDATA["Mexico admits you through an arched stone orifice into the tree-filled courtyard of its heart, where a dog pisses against a wall and a waiter hustles through a curtain of jasmine to bring a bowl of tortilla soup, steaming with cilantro and lime. Cats stalk lizards among the clay pots around the fountain, doves settle into the flowering vines and coo their prayers, thankful for the existence of lizards.  The potted plants silently exhale, outgrowing their clay pots.  Like Mexico's children they stand pinched and patient in last year's too-small shoes. " -- Barbara Kingsolver]]>
