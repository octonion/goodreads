		<description>
	    <![CDATA["And it's deadly to us. We can inspire lust, but it's just a shadow. An illusion. Love is a dangerous force.&quot; He shook his head. &quot;Love killed the dinosaurs, man.&quot; 

I'm pretty sure a meteor killed the dinosaurs, Thomas.&quot; 

He shrugged. &quot;There's a theory making the rounds now that when the meteor hit it only killed off the big stuff. That there were plenty of smaller reptiles running around, about the same size as all the mammals at the time. The reptiles should have regained their position eventually, but they didn't, because the mammals could feel love. They could be utterly, even irrationally devoted to their mates and their offspring. It made them more likely to survive. The lizards couldn't do that. The meteor hit gave the mammals their shot, but it was love that turned the tide." -- Jim Butcher]]>

	    <![CDATA["We are not going to die.&quot; 

Butters stared up at me, pale, his eyes terrified. &quot;We're not?&quot; 

No. And do you know why?&quot; He shook his head. &quot;Because Thomas is too pretty to die. And because I'm too stubborn to die.&quot; I hauled on the shirt even harder. &quot;And most of all because tomorrow is Oktoberfest, Butters, and polka will never die." -- Jim Butcher]]>
