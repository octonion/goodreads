	    <![CDATA["The tears I feel today
I'll wait to shed tomorrow.
Though I'll not sleep this night
Nor find surcease from sorrow.
My eyes must keep their sight:
I dare not be tear-blinded.
I must be free to talk
Not choked with grief, clear-minded.
My mouth cannot betray
The anguish that I know.
Yes, I'll keep my tears til later:
But my grief will never go." -- Anne McCaffrey]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I don't care if Todd Rand is as kind as Jesus himself, my place was with you and I will never regret that. You and Damien and Spencer gave Dominique and me an amazing life that I love more than I can ever tell you. Things worked out the way they were supposed to. This family was always the best option for me, Dante, the only option I'd ever have chosen if I'd been given the choice. This changes nothing in my heart. We were all meant to be together, meant to make up a family that defied the odds. I hope that Todd and Flynn are wonderful and that I can have relationships with both, but if they don't want to know me, I'm not going to be upset. I already have the perfect family for me, and since you're the head of this family, that's on you." -- ELLA FOX]]>

	    <![CDATA["Delilah, I care about Leah already and I hope she's wonderful, but no matter what, you and Dominique will always be my babies. You're telling me to calm down, but here you are scared for the same reason. Now I get how silly the way I was feeling is. No matter what Delilah, nothing will ever change between us. It won't be any different than when Aunt Sandra, Sabrina, Brooke or Tally became part of the family. We'll just be a bigger unit." -- Ella Fox]]>

You’re perfect for me because we were born to complete each other.” Cradling his face in my hand, I smiled at him. “I love you Spencer Cross, and we’re going to have a beautiful family. Have faith." -- Ella Fox]]>

	    <![CDATA["I don’t think I’ll be worth shit as a father, but I’m going to be here for you and our baby until the day I die. I want you to know that I was relieved that our baby is fine, and I was devastated when I thought you might have miscarried. I’m sorry; I was a jackass because I was scared shitless. When you fell, I was terrified that I’d lost you both. I want you to have the baby Delilah. I love you more than anything, and I’ll love the baby too. How can I not when it’s a part of you?" -- Ella Fox]]>
