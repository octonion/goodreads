	    <![CDATA["The opposite of love is not hate, it's indifference. The opposite of art is not ugliness, it's indifference. The opposite of faith is not heresy, it's indifference. And the opposite of life is not death, it's indifference." -- Elie Wiesel]]>

	    <![CDATA["What?  'Borderline patients play games'?  That what you said?  Ernest, you'll never be a real therapist if you think like that.  That's exactly what I meant earlier when I talked about the dangers of diagnosis.  There are borderlines and there are borderlines.  Labels do violence to people.  You can't treat the label; you have to treat the person behind the label. (17)" -- Irvin D. Yalom]]>
