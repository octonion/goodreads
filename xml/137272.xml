	    <![CDATA["When we got to the part where we had to improvise an argument in a poetic language, I got cold feet. &quot;I can't do this,&quot; I said. &quot;I don't know what to say.&quot;

&quot;Say anything,&quot; he said. &quot;You can't make a mistake when you improvise.&quot;

&quot;What if I mess it up? What if I screw up the rhythm?&quot;

&quot;You can't,&quot; he said. &quot;It's like drumming. If you miss a beat, you create another.&quot;

In this simple exchange, Sam taught me the secret of improvisation, one that I have accessed my whole life." -- Patti Smith]]>

	    <![CDATA["Next Christmas he was going to open this shabby sack of hers... and put something in the money compartment. She would fritter it away, of course, in small unimportances; so that in the end she would not know what she had done with it; but perhaps a series of small satisfactions scattered like sequins over the texture of everyday life was of greater worth than the academic satisfaction of owning a collection of fine objects at the back of a drawer." -- Josephine Tey]]>
