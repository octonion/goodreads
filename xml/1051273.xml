	    <![CDATA["She dreamed of him, his face, filling the dream. &quot;Things are ending,&quot; he told her. &quot;This civilization; things are closing in on it. It has been quite a culture, brilliant and foul, cannibal and Christian, the glory of the world. We should celebrate it while we can; until night falls.&quot;
She didn't agree, not even in the dream, but she knew, as she dreamed, that there was no point telling him now." -- Salman Rushdie]]>
