	    <![CDATA["[Verity]&quot;What was that all about?&quot; 
[Duke of Kylemore] &quot;The kiss? You said it yourself. It was to teach you a lesson.&quot; He used the cold cutting voice again... 
[Verity] That you can touch me whenever you feel like it?&quot; She injected a challenge into her voice. &quot;I already knew that.&quot; 
[Duke of Kylemore] He smiled slightly. &quot;Yes. But now you know when I touch you, you're not immune. And that thought will eat at you like acid." -- Anna Campbell]]>
