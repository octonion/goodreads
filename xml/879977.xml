	    <![CDATA["There were two things about Mama.  One is she always expected the best out of me.  And the other is that then no matter what I did, whatever I came home with, she acted like it was the moon I had just hung up in the sky and plugged in all the stars.  Like I was that good." -- Barbara Kingsolver]]>
