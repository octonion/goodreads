	    <![CDATA["Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without being charming. This is a fault. Those who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things are the cultivated. For these there is hope. They are the elect to whom beautiful things mean only Beauty. There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written. That is all." -- Oscar Wilde]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Tess is a bit shy,&quot; her mother used to tell people in an audible whisper, her hand over her mouth.  &quot;Gets it from her father, I'm afraid.&quot; Tess had heard the cheerful disrespect in her mother's voice and had come to believe that any form of shyness was wrong- morally wrong, in fact.  You should want to go to parties.  You should want to be surrounded by people.  No wonder she felt so ashamed of her shyness, as if it were an embarrassing physical ailment that needed to be hidden at all costs." -- Liane Moriarty]]>
