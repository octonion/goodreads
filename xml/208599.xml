		<description>
	    <![CDATA["People in general attach too much importance to words.  They are under the illusion that talking effects great results.

When the distraction of the tongue is removed, the heart listens." -- Theodore Dreiser]]>

I do not need one big and strong
nor yet so very tall,
nor need he be some genius,
or wealthy, Lord, at all;
but let his head be high, dear God,
and let his eye be clear,
his shoulders straight, whate'er his state,
whate'er his earthly sphere;
and let his face have character,
a ruggedness if soul,
and let his whole life show, dear God,
a singleness of goal;
then when he comes
(as he will come)
with quiet eyes aglow,
I'll understand that he's the man
I prayed for long ago." -- Ruth Bell Graham]]>

Death can be faced,
dealt with, 
adjusted to,

It's the
not knowing

interminably...
This
being suspended
in suspense;
waiting - weightless,
How does one face
the faceless,
adjust to nothing?
Waiting implies
something to wait for.

There is One.
One who knows...
I rest my soul on that." -- Ruth Bell Graham]]>
