		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Esperanza leaned around the side of the truck.  As they rounded a curve, it appeared as if the mountains pulled away from each other, like a curtain opening on stage, revealing the San Joaquin Valley beyond.  Flat and spacious, it spread out like a blanket of patchwork fields.  Esperanza could see no end to the plots of yellow, brown, and shades of green.  The road finally leveled out on the valley floor, and she gazed back at the mountains from where they'd come.  They looked like monstrous lions' paws resting at the edge of ridge.  " -- Pam Munoz Ryan]]>
