	    <![CDATA["Ah, Evie,” she heard him say softly, “I must have a heart, after all…because right now it aches like the devil.”
“Only your heart?” she asked ingenuously, making him laugh.
He lowered her to the bed, his eyes sparkling wickedly. “Also a few other things,” he conceded. “And as my wife, it’s your duty to ease all my aches." -- Lisa Kleypas]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["When Christopher finished, there was a moment of silence.
Leo looked at Cam expectantly. “Well?”
“Well what?”
“Now is the time when you dredge up one of your blasted Romany sayings. Something about roosters laying eggs, or pigs dancing in the orchard. It’s what you always do. Let’s have it.”
Cam gave him a sardonic glance. “I can’t think of one right now.”
“By God, I’ve had to listen to hundreds of them. And Phelan doesn’t have to hear even one?" -- Lisa Kleypas]]>

	    <![CDATA["Cam held her closer. &quot;Marry me, Amelia. You're what I want. You're my fate.&quot; One hand slid to the back of her head, gripping the braids and ribbons to keep her mouth upturned. &quot;Say yes.&quot; He nibbled at her lips, licked at them, opened them. He kissed her until she
writhed in his arms, her pulse racing. &quot;Say it, Amelia, and save me from ever having to spend a night with another woman. I'll sleep indoors. I'll get a haircut. God help me, I think I'd even carry a pocket watch if it pleased you." -- Lisa Kleypas]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I am illegitimate,&quot; she said distinctly, as if he were a foreigner trying to learn English. &quot;You are a viscount. You can't marry a bastard.&quot;
&quot;What about the Duke of Clarence? He had ten bastard children by that actress...what was her name...&quot;
&quot;Mrs. Jordan.&quot;
&quot;Yes, that one, Their children were all illegitimate, but some of them married peers.&quot;
&quot;You're not the Duke of Clarence.&quot;
&quot;That's right. I'm not a blueblood any more than you are. I inherited the title purely by happenstance&quot;
&quot;That doesn't matter. If your married me, it would be scandalous and inappropriate, and doors would be closed to you.&quot;
&quot;Good God, woman, I let two of my sisters marry Gypsies. Those doors have already been closed, bolted, and nailed shut." -- Lisa Kleypas]]>
