	    <![CDATA["People in general attach too much importance to words.  They are under the illusion that talking effects great results.  As a matter of fact, words are, as a rule, the shallowest portion of all the argument.  They but dimly represent the great surging feelings and desires which lie behind.  When the distraction of the tongue is removed, the heart listens." -- Theodore Dreiser]]>

	    <![CDATA["Oh, the comfort — the inexpressible comfort of feeling &lt;i&gt;safe&lt;/i&gt; with a person — having neither to weigh thoughts nor measure words, but pouring them all right out, just as they are, chaff and grain together; certain that a faithful hand will take and sift them, keep what is worth keeping, and then with the breath of kindness blow the rest away." -- Dinah Maria Mulock Craik]]>
