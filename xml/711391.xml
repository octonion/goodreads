Every time I read Pride and Prejudice I want to dig her up and beat her over the skull with her own shin-bone." -- Mark Twain]]>

	    <![CDATA["&lt;b&gt;Ozymandias&lt;/b&gt;

I met a traveller from an antique land
Who said: &quot;Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
Stand in the desert. Near them on the sand,
Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown
And wrinkled lip and sneer of cold command
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed.
And on the pedestal these words appear:
'My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings:
Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair!'
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare,
The lone and level sands stretch far away." -- Percy Bysshe Shelley]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Books permit us to voyage through time, to tap the wisdom of our ancestors. The library connects us with the insight and knowledge, painfully extracted from Nature, of the greatest minds that ever were, with the best teachers, drawn from the entire planet and from all our history, to instruct us without tiring, and to inspire us to make our own contribution to the collective knowledge of the human species. I think the health of our civilization, the depth of our awareness about the underpinnings of our culture and our concern for the future can all be tested by how well we support our libraries." -- Carl Sagan]]>

Across the millenia, the author is speaking, clearly and silently, inside your head, directly to you.  Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions, binding together people, citizens of distant epochs, who never knew one another.  Books break the shackles of time." -- Carl Sagan]]>

	    <![CDATA["But one type of book that practically no one likes to read is a book about the law. Books about the law are notorious for being very long, very dull, and very difficult to read. This is one reason many lawyers make heaps of money. The money is an incentive - the word &quot;incentive&quot; here means &quot;an offered reward to persuade you to do something you don't want to do - to read long, dull, and difficult books." -- Lemony Snicket]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["A God who kept tinkering with the universe was absurd; a God  
who interfered with human freedom and creativity was a tyrant. If God is  
seen as a self in a world of his own, an ego that
relates to a thought, a cause separate from its effect, he becomes a  
being, not Being itself. An omnipotent, all‐knowing tyrant is not so  
different from earthly dictators who make everything and
everybody mere cogs in the machine which they controlled. An atheism  
that rejects such a God is amply justified." -- Karen Armstrong]]>
