		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Good. Item seven. The &lt;i&gt;had had&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;that that&lt;/i&gt; problem. Lady Cavendish, weren’t you working on this?’ 

Lady Cavendish stood up and gathered her thoughts. ‘Indeed. The uses of &lt;i&gt;had had&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;that that&lt;/i&gt; have to be strictly controlled; they can interrupt the imaginotransference quite dramatically, causing readers to go back over the sentence in confusion, something we try to avoid.’

 ‘Go on.’

 ‘It’s mostly an unlicensed-usage problem. At the last count David Copperfield alone had had &lt;i&gt;had had&lt;/i&gt; sixty three times, all but ten unapproved. Pilgrim’s Progress may also be a problem due to its &lt;i&gt;had had/that that&lt;/i&gt; ratio.’

 ‘So what’s the problem in Progress?’ 

 ‘That that had &lt;i&gt;that that&lt;/i&gt; ten times but had had &lt;i&gt;had had&lt;/i&gt; only thrice. Increased &lt;i&gt;had had&lt;/i&gt; usage had had to be overlooked, but not if the number exceeds that &lt;i&gt;that that&lt;/i&gt; usage.’

 ‘Hmm,’ said the Bellman, ‘I thought &lt;i&gt;had had&lt;/i&gt; had had TGC’s approval for use in Dickens? What’s the problem?’ 

 ‘Take the first &lt;i&gt;had had&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;that that&lt;/i&gt; in the book by way of example,’ said Lady Cavendish. ‘You would have thought that that first &lt;i&gt;had had&lt;/i&gt; had had good occasion to be seen as &lt;i&gt;had&lt;/i&gt;, had you not? &lt;i&gt;Had&lt;/i&gt; had had approval but &lt;i&gt;had had&lt;/i&gt; had not; equally it is true to say that that &lt;i&gt;that that&lt;/i&gt; had had approval but that that other &lt;i&gt;that that&lt;/i&gt; had not.’ 

 ‘So the problem with that other &lt;i&gt;that that&lt;/i&gt; was that…?’

 ‘That that other-other &lt;i&gt;that that&lt;/i&gt; had had approval.’ 

 ‘Okay’ said the Bellman, whose head was in danger of falling apart like a chocolate orange, ‘let me get this straight: David Copperfield, unlike Pilgrim’s Progress, had had &lt;i&gt;had&lt;/i&gt;, had had &lt;i&gt;had had&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Had had&lt;/i&gt; had had TGC’s approval?’

 There was a very long pause. ‘Right,’ said the Bellman with a sigh, ‘that’s it for the moment. I’ll be giving out assignments in ten minutes. Session’s over – and let’s be careful out there." -- Jasper Fforde]]>

And while none of it well be me when it goes in, after a while it'll all gather together inside and it'll be me. Look at the world out there, my God, my God, look at it out there, outside me, out there beyond my face and the only way to really touch it is to put it where it's finally me, where it's in the blood, where it pumps around a thousand times ten thousand a day. I get hold of it so it'll never run off. I'll hold onto the world tight some day. I've got one finger on it now; that's a beginning." -- Ray Bradbury]]>

people so tired
mutilated
either by love or no love.

people just are not good to each other
one on one.

the rich are not good to the rich
the poor are not good to the poor.

we are afraid.

our educational system tells us
that we can all be
big-ass winners.

it hasn't told us
about the gutters
or the suicides.

or the terror of one person
aching in one place
alone

untouched
unspoken to

watering a plant." -- Charles Bukowski]]>
