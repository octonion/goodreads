	    <![CDATA["Yelena, you've driven me crazy. You've caused me considerable trouble and I've contemplated ending your life twice since I've known you.&quot; Valek's warm breath in my ear sent a shiver down my spine.

&quot;But you’ve slipped under my skin, invaded my blood and seized my heart.”

“That sounds more like a poison than a person,” was all I could say. His confession had both shocked and thrilled me.

“Exactly,” Valek replied. “You have poisoned me." -- Maria V. Snyder]]>

Not all those who wander are lost;

A light from the shadows shall spring;
Renewed shall be blade that was broken,
The crownless again shall be king." -- J.R.R. Tolkien]]>

She hesitated for a moment, then mustered her courage and said, &quot;Why?&quot;  She though he understood her meaning: Why her?  Why save her, and now why try to rescue her?  She had guessed at the answer, but she wanted to hear him say it.
He stared at her for the longest while, and then, in a low, hard voice, he said, &quot;You know why." -- Christopher Paolini]]>
