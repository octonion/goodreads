Dorcas, the last twenty or thirty years I've been a worthless, no-good parasite.'
She yawned again. 'Everybody knows that.'
Nevermind the flattery. There comes a time in every man's life when he has to stop being sensible--a time to stand up and be counted--strike a blow for liberty--smite the wicked.'
Ummm...'
So quit yawning, the time has come.'

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["There are two possible responses to a world suddenly gripped by terror and contention.  There is the Moseley way: get mad and get even.  But as the course of King Philip's War proved, unbridled arrogance and fear only feed the flames of violence.  Then there is the (Benjamin) Church way.  Instead of killing him, try to bring him around to your way of thinking.  First and foremost, treat him like a human being.  For Church, success in war was about coercion rather that slaughter, and in this he anticipated the welcoming, transformative beast that eventually became, once the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution were in place, the United States." -- Nathaniel Philbrick]]>

	    <![CDATA["The shells had landed on the cobblestone road.

&quot;Sonsofbitches,&quot; Wiseman muttered.

We looked up and grinned at each other.

&quot;Here they come again!&quot;

Sitting in an inch of water.  I closed my eyes, gritted my teeth, held my breath, and clutched my elbows with my arms around my knees.

Three more shells came in, low and angry, and burst in the orchard.  

&quot;They're walking 'em towards us,&quot; I whispered.

I felt as if a giant with exploding iron fingers were looking for me, tearing up the ground as he came.  I wanted to strike at him, to kill him, to stop him before he ripped into me, but I could do nothing.  Sit and take it, sit and take it.  The giant raked the orchard and tore up the roads and stumbled toward us in a terrible blind wrath as we sat in our hole with our heads between our legs and curses on our lips." -- David Kenyon Webster]]>
