	    <![CDATA["My desire and wish is that the things I start with should be so obvious that you wonder why I spend my time stating them.

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Don't flatter yourself that friendship authorizes you to say disagreeable things to your intimates. The nearer you come into relation with a person, the more necessary do tact and courtesy become. Except in cases of necessity, which are rare, leave your friend to learn unpleasant things from his enemies; they are ready enough to tell them." -- Oliver Wendall Holmes]]>
