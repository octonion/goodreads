Then write. If it's good, you'll find out. If it's not, throw it out of the window." -- William Faulkner]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I decline to accept the end of man... I refuse to accept this.  I believe that man will not merely endure: he will prevail.  He is immortal, not because he alone among the creatures has an inexhaustible voice, but because he has a soul, a spirit capable of compassion and sacrifice and endurance.  The poet's, the writer's, duty is to write about these things.  It is his privilege to help man endure by lifting his heart, by reminding him of the courage and honor and hope and pride and compassion and pity and sacrifice which have been the glory of his past.  The poet's voice need not merely be the record of man, it can be one of the props, the pillars to help him endure and prevail." -- William Faulkner]]>

	    <![CDATA[https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/14919-the-seriousness-of-throwing-over-hell-whilst-still-clinging-to]]>
		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The seriousness of throwing over hell whilst still clinging to the Atonement is obvious. If there is no punishment for sin there can be no self-forgiveness for it. If Christ paid our score, and if there is no hell and therefore no chance of our getting into trouble by forgetting the obligation, then we can be as wicked as we like with impunity inside the secular law, even from self-reproach, which becomes mere ingratitude to the Savior. On the other hand, if Christ did not pay our score, it still stands against us; and such debts make us extremely uncomfortable. The drive of evolution, which we call conscience and honor, seizes on such slips, and shames us to the dust for being so low in the scale as to be capable of them. &lt;b&gt;The 'saved' thief experiences an ecstatic happiness which can never come to the honest atheist: he is tempted to steal again to repeat the glorious sensation. But if the atheist steals he has no such happiness. He is a thief and knows that he is a thief. Nothing can rub that off him. He may try to sooth his shame by some sort of restitution or equivalent act of benevolence; but that does not alter the fact that he did steal; and his conscience will not be easy until he has conquered his will to steal and changed himself into an honest man&lt;/b&gt;...

Now though the state of the believers in the atonement may thus be the happier, it is most certainly not more desirable from the point of view of the community. &lt;b&gt;The fact that a believer is happier than a sceptic is no more to the point than the fact that a drunken man is happier than a sober one. The happiness of credulity is a cheap and dangerous quality of happiness, and by no means a necessity of life&lt;/b&gt;. Whether [author:Socrates|275648] got as much happiness out of life as Wesley is an unanswerable question; but a nation of [author:Socrateses|275648] would be much safer and happier than a nation of Wesleys; and its individuals would be higher in the evolutionary scale. At all events it is in the [author:Socratic|275648] man and not in the Wesleyan that our hope lies now.

Consequently, even if it were mentally possible for all of us to believe in the Atonement, we should have to cry off it, as we evidently have a right to do. &lt;b&gt;Every man to whom salvation is offered has an inalienable natural right to say 'No, thank you: I prefer to retain my full moral responsibility: it is not good for me to be able to load a scapegoat with my sins: I should be less careful how I committed them if I knew they would cost me nothing.'&lt;/b&gt;" -- George Bernard Shaw]]>
