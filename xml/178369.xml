		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["We do not grow absolutely, chronologically. We grow sometimes in one dimension, and not in another; unevenly. We grow partially. We are relative. We are mature in one realm, childish in another. The past, present, and future mingle and pull us backward, forward, or fix us in the present. We are made up of layers, cells, constellations." -- Anais Nin]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Do not let your fire go out, spark by irreplaceable spark in the hopeless swamps of the not-quite, the not-yet, and the not-at-all. Do not let the hero in your soul perish in lonely frustration for the life you deserved and have never been able to reach. The world you desire can be won. It exists.. it is real.. it is possible.. it's yours." -- Ayn Rand]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Anyway, the apple is essential. How come these hens don't get it? They go to church year after year, they read the Bible, or at least keep it on their bedside table, and then they forget how the first seduction of the first man occured? With an apple, that's how. No man can resist a woman who has an apple in her hand. Its theological. A woman with an apple in her hand is the first woman, the only woman in the world, and he's the first man -he stumbles on love and he can't shake it, never ever ever." -- Pia Pera]]>
