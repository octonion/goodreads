		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I think it's perfectly possible to explain how the universe came about without bringing God into it, but I don't know everything, and there may well be a God somewhere, hiding away. Actually, if he is keeping out of sight, it's because he's ashamed of his followers and all the cruelty and ignorance they're responsible for promoting in his name. If I were him, I'd want nothing to do with them." -- Philip Pullman]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Wait,&quot; I say.  &quot;I think you're mistaken.  Saying there is no dream is the same as saying everything is a dream.  Isn't it?  Everyone's a dreamer?  Extraordinary things happen all the time even when we're awake.  What I meant to suggest to you, if indeed that was me in your dream doing the suggesting, is that there is only one world.  This one.  The dream is real.  The ordinary is the wonderful.  The wonderful is the ordinary." -- Samantha Hunt]]>
