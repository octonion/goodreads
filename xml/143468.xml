	    <![CDATA["If we can forgive what has been done to us . . .

If we can forgive what we've done to others . . .

If we can leave all of our stories behind.  Our being
villians or victims.

Only then can we maybe rescue the world.

But we still sit here, waiting to be saved.  While we're
still victims, hoping to be discovered while we suffer." -- Chuck Palahniuk]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Now the whole offer which Christianity makes is this: that we can, if we let God have His way, come to share in the life of Christ. If we do, we shall then be sharing a life which was begotten, not made, which always existed and always will exist. Christ is the Son of God. If we share in this kind of life we also shall be sons of God. We shall love the Father as He does and the Holy Ghost will arise in us. He came to this world and became a man in order to spread to other men the kind of life He has â€” by what I call &quot;good infection.&quot; Every Christian is to become a little Christ. The whole purpose of becoming a Christian is simply nothing else." -- C.S. Lewis]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I like to receive money for my work.  But I can pass that up this time.  I like to have people know my work is done by me.  But I can pass that up.  I like to have tenants made happy by my work.  But that doesn't matter too much.  The only thing that matters, my goal, my reward, my beginning, my end is the work itself.  My work done my way.  Peter, there's nothing in the world that you can offer me, except this.  Offer me this and you can have anything I've got to give.  My work done my way.  A private, personal, selfish, egotistical motivation.  That's the only way I function.  That's all I am." -- Ayn Rand]]>

	    <![CDATA["Why do they always teach us that it's easy and evil to do what we want and that we need discipline to restrain ourselves? It's the hardest thing in the world--to do what we want. And it takes the greatest kind of courage. I mean, what we really want." -- Ayn Rand]]>
