		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The human race is the most stupid and unfair kind of race. A lot of the runners don't even get decent sneakers or clean drinking water.

Some runners are born with a massive head start, every possible help along the way and still the referees seem to be on their side.

It's not surprising a lot of people have given up compeating altogether and gone to sit in the grandstand, eat junk and shout abuse.

What the human race needs is a lot more streakers." -- Banksy]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The thing I hate the most about advertising is that it attracts all the bright, creative and ambitious young people, leaving us mainly with the slow and self-obsessed to become our artists.. Modern art is a disaster area. Never in the field of human history has so much been used by so many to say so little." -- Banksy]]>
