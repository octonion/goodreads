	    <![CDATA["All that is gold does not glitter,
Not all those who wander are lost;
The old that is strong does not wither,
Deep roots are not reached by the frost.

From the ashes a fire shall be woken,
A light from the shadows shall spring;
Renewed shall be blade that was broken,
The crownless again shall be king." -- J.R.R. Tolkien]]>

	    <![CDATA["My religious convictions and scientific views cannot at present be more specifically defined than as those of a believer in creative evolution. I desire that no public monument or work of art or inscription or sermon or ritual service commemorating me shall suggest that I accepted the tenets peculiar to any established church or denomination nor take the form of a cross or any other instrument of torture or symbol of blood sacrifice.

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The first time it was reported that our friends were being butchered there was a cry of horror. Then a hundred were butchered. But when a thousand were butchered and there was no end to the butchery, a blanket of silence spread. 
When evil-doing comes like falling rain, nobody calls out &quot;stop!&quot;

When crimes begin to pile up they become invisible. When sufferings become unendurable the cries are no longer heard. The cries, too, fall like rain in summer." -- Bertolt Brecht]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["He that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God. God is love. Therefore love. Without distinction, without calculation, without procrastination, love. Lavish it upon the poor, where it is very easy; especially upon the rich, who often need it most; most of all upon out equals, where it is very difficult, and for whom perhaps we do the least of all." -- Henry Drummond]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["What a privilege and opportunity it is to utterly come to the end of one's hope-not only to run out of answers, but to run out of questions.  To be beyond fighting, to come to that suspended animation where we are so confused and so weak that we can neither fight or run.  When you come to the end of yourself, you find the beginning of God.  And there and nowhere else, you find the answers you seek.  You find fulfillment for the longings of your soul.  " -- Max Anders]]>
