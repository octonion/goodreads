	    <![CDATA["Alice thought, No. It wasn't the War and the disgruntled veterans; it wasn't the droves and droves of colored people flocking to paychecks and streets full of themselves. It was the music. The dirty, get-on-down music the women sang and the men played and both danced to, close and shamelesss or apart and wild...It made you do unwise disorderly things. Just hearing it was like violating the law." -- Toni Morrison]]>

	    <![CDATA["maybe memories are like karaoke-where you realize up on the stage, with all those lyrics scrawling across the screen's bottom, and with everybody clapping at you, that you didn't know even half the lyrics to your all-time favourite song. Only afterwards, when someone else is up on stage humiliating themselves amid the clapping and laughing, do you realize that what you liiked most about your favourite song was precisely your ignorance of its full meaning- and you read more into it than maybe existed in the first place. I think it's better to not know the lyrics to your life." -- Douglas Coupland]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I soon discovered that one doesn't simply read &lt;i&gt;Crime and Punishment&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&lt;/i&gt;. One reads a certain edition, a specific copy, recognizable by the roughness or the smoothness of its paper, by its scent, by a slight tear on page 72 and a coffee ring on the right-hand corner of the back cover.

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["She's not dead, Henry kept telling himself. But her life, all lives, seemed tenuous when he saw how quickly, with what ease, all the trappings, all the fine details of a lifetime could be packed and scattered, or junked." -- Ian McEwen]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["In the weeks that followed, we amazed ourselves. Our habits slid apart easily...And our very few intimacies were simply discontinued. Where did they go, those things we did? Were they recycled? Did some new couple in China do them? Were a Swedish man and woman foot to foot at this very moment? " -- Miranda July]]>

	    <![CDATA["In the end, I think the relationships that survive in this world are the ones where  two people can finish each other's sentences. Forget drama and torrid sex and the clash of opposites. Give me banter any day of the week. " -- Douglas Coupland]]>
