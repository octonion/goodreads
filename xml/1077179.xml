	    <![CDATA["He dug so deeply into her sentiments that in search of interest he found love, because by trying to make her love him he ended up falling in love with her. Petra Cotes, for her part, loved him more and more as she felt his love increasing, and that was how in the ripeness of autumn she began to believe once more in the youthful superstition that poverty was the servitude of love. Both looked back then on the wild revelry, the gaudy wealth, and the unbridled fornication as an annoyance and they lamented that it had cost them so much of their lives to find the paradise of shared solitude. Madly in love after so many years of sterile complicity, they enjoyed the miracle of living each other as much at the table as in bed, and they grew to be so happy that even when they were two worn-out people they kept on blooming like little children and playing together like dogs." -- Gabriel García Márquez]]>

	    <![CDATA["Não te amo como se fosse rosa de sal,topázio
ou flecha de cravos que
propagam o fogo:
te amo como se amam certas coisas obscuras,
secretamente,entre a sombra e a alma.

Te amo como a planta que não
floresce e leva
dentro de si,oculta, a luz daquelas flores,
e graças a
teu amor vive escuro em meu corpo
o apertado aroma que ascendeu da terra.

Te amo sem saber como,nem quando,nem onde,
te amo diretamente sem
problemas nem orgulho:
assim te amo porque não sei amar de outra maneira,

senão assim deste modo em que eu não sou nem és
tão perto que tua
mão sobre meu peito é minha
tão perto que se fecham meus olhos com meu
sonho." -- Pablo Neruda]]>
