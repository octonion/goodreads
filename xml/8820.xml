	    <![CDATA["Sometimes, you read a book and it fills you with this weird evangelical zeal, and you become convinced that the shattered world will never be put back together unless and until all living humans read the book. And then there are books like An Imperial Affliction, which you can't tell people about, books so special and rare and yours that advertising your affection feels like betrayal" -- John Green]]>

	    <![CDATA["... I had a PET scan scheduled in a couple weeks.  If something was wrong, I'd find out soon enough.  Nothing to be gained by worrying between now and then.
     And yet still I worried.  I liked being a person.  I wanted to keep at it.  Worry is yet another side effect of dying." -- John Green]]>

	    <![CDATA["Some wars,&quot; he said dismissively. &quot;What am I at war with? My cancer. And what is my cancer? My cancer is me. The tumors are made of me. They're made of me as surely as my brain and my heart is made of me. It is a civil war, Hazel Grace, with a predetermined winner." -- John Green]]>
