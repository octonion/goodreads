The crownless again shall be king." -- J.R.R. Tolkien]]>

Where many paths and errands meet.
And whither then? I cannot say" -- J.R.R. Tolkien]]>

Oh, you'll know all right. Odd things, they say-even their looks-will let the secret out. Keep your eyes open. Bless me, what do they teach them at these schools.&quot;
