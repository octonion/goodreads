		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I do not say that democracy has been more pernicious on the whole, and in the long run, than monarchy or aristocracy. Democracy has never been and never can be so durable as aristocracy or monarchy; but while it lasts, it is more bloody than either. â€¦ Remember, democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts, and murders itself. There never was a democracy yet that did not commit suicide. It is in vain to say that democracy is less vain, less proud, less selfish, less ambitious, or less avaricious than aristocracy or monarchy. It is not true, in fact, and nowhere appears in history. Those passions are the same in all men, under all forms of simple government, and when unchecked, produce the same effects of fraud, violence, and cruelty. When clear prospects are opened before vanity, pride, avarice, or ambition, for their easy gratification, it is hard for the most considerate philosophers and the most conscientious moralists to resist the temptation. Individuals have conquered themselves. Nations and large bodies of men, never." -- John Adams]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["A general State education is a mere contrivance for moulding people to be exactly like one another; and as the mould in which it casts them is that which pleases the dominant power in the government, whether this be a monarch, an aristocracy, or a majority of the existing generation; in proportion as it is efficient and successful, it establishes a despotism over the mind, leading by a natural tendency to one over the body." -- John Stuart Mill]]>

	    <![CDATA["It's time to admit that public education operates like a planned economy, a bureaucratic system in which everybody's role is spelled out in advance and there are few incentives for innovation and productivity.  It's no surprise that our school system doesn't improve: it more resembles the communist economy than our own market economy." -- Albert Shanker, Former Pres of American Federation of Teachers]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The tenth plank in Karl Marx's Manifesto for destroying our kind of civilization advocated the establishment of &quot;free education for all children in public schools.&quot; There were several reasons why Marx wanted government to run the schools.â€¦one of them [was that] â€˜It is capable of exact demonstration that if every party in the State has the right of excluding from public schools whatever he does not believe to be true, then he that believes most must give way to him that believes least, and then he that believes least must give way to him that believes absolutely nothing, no matter in how small a minority the atheists or agnostics may be.â€™

It is self-evident that on this scheme, if it is consistently and persistently carried out in all parts of the country, the United States system of national popular education will be the most efficient and widespread instrument for the propagation of atheism which the world has ever seen." -- Ezra Taft Benson]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["It is a fundamental truth that the responsibilities of motherhood cannot be successfully delegated.  No, not to day-care centers, not to schools, not to nurseries, not to babysitters.  We become enamored with menâ€™s theories such as the idea of preschool training outside the home for young children.   Not only does this put added pressure on the budget, but it places young children in an environment away from motherâ€™s influence.  Too often the pressure for popularity, on children and teens, places an economic burden on the income of the father, so mother feels she must go to work to satisfy her childrenâ€™s needs.  That decision can be most shortsighted.  It is motherâ€™s influence during the crucial formative years that forms a childâ€™s basic character.  Home is the place where a child learns faith, feels love, and thereby learns from motherâ€™s loving example to choose righteousness.  How vital are motherâ€™s influence and teaching in the homeâ€”and how apparent when neglected!" -- Ezra Taft Benson]]>

	    <![CDATA["In many places it is literally not safe physically for youngsters to go to school.  And in many schools, and its becoming almost generally true, it is spiritually unsafe to attend public schools.  Look back over the history of education to the turn of the century and the beginning of the educational philosophies, pragmatism and humanism were the early ones, and they branched out into a number of other philosophies which have led us now into a circumstance where our schools are producing the problems that we face." -- Boyd K. Packer]]>
