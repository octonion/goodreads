	    <![CDATA["First they came for the communists, and I did not speak out—
    because I was not a communist;
Then they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out—
    because I was not a socialist;
Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out—
    because I was not a trade unionist;
Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—
    because I was not a Jew;
Then they came for me—
    and there was no one left to speak out for me." -- Martin Niemöller]]>
