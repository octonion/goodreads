	    <![CDATA["His sisters -- my aunts -- did not go to school at all, just like millions of girls in my country.  Education had been a great gift for him.  He believed that lack of education was the root of all of Pakistan's problems.  Ignorance allowed politicians to fool people and bad administrators to be re-elected.  He believed schooling should be available for all, rich and poor, boys and girls.  The school that my father dreamed of would have desks and a library, computers, bright posters on the walls and, most important, washrooms." -- Malala Yousafzai]]>
