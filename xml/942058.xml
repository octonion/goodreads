	    <![CDATA["She wondered: How could people respond to these images if images didn't secretly enjoy the same status as real things?  Not that images were so powerful, but that the world was so weak.  It could be read, certainly, in its weakness, as on days when the sun baked fallen apples in orchards and the valley smelled like cider, and cold nights when Jordan had driven Chadds Ford for dinner and the tires of her Chevrolet had crunched on the gravel driveway; but the world was fungible only as images.  Nothing got inside the head without becoming pictures." -- Jonathan Franzen]]>
