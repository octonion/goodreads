	    <![CDATA["It is demonstrable,&quot; said he, &quot;that things cannot be otherwise than as they are; for as all things have been created for some end, they must necessarily be created for the best end. Observe, for instance, the nose is formed for spectacles, therefore we wear spectacles. The legs are visibly designed for stockings, accordingly we wear stockings. Stones were made to be hewn and to construct castles, therefore My Lord has a magnificent castle; for the greatest baron in the province ought to be the best lodged. Swine were intended to be eaten, therefore we eat pork all the year round: and they, who assert that everything is right, do not express themselves correctly; they should say that everything is best." -- Voltaire]]>

	    <![CDATA["&lt;b&gt;Eve:&lt;/b&gt; All this riot and uproar, V... is this Anarchy? Is this the Land of Do-As-You-Please? 

&lt;b&gt;V:&lt;/b&gt; No. This is only the land of take-what-you-want. Anarchy means &quot;without leaders&quot;, not &quot;without order&quot;. With anarchy comes an age or ordnung, of true order, which is to say voluntary order... this age of ordung will begin when the mad and incoherent cycle of verwirrung that these bulletins reveal has run its course... This is not anarchy, Eve. This is chaos." -- Alan Moore]]>
