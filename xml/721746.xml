		<description>
	    <![CDATA["To reverse the effects of civilization would destroy the dreams of a lot of people.  There's no way around it.  We can talk all we want about sustainability, but there's a sense in which it doesn't matter that these people's dreams are based on, embedded in, intertwined with, and formed by an inherently destructive economic and social system.  Their dreams are still their dreams.  What right do I -- or does anyone else -- have to destroy them.

At the same time, what right do they have to destroy the world?" -- Derrick Jensen]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["To call the population of strangers in the midst of which we live &quot;society&quot; is such a usurpation that even the sociologists wonder if they should abandon a concept that was, for a century, their bread and butter.  Now they prefer the metaphor of a &lt;i&gt; network&lt;/i&gt; to describe the connection of cybernetic solitudes, the intermeshing of weak interactions under names like &quot;colleague,&quot; &quot;contact,&quot; &quot;buddy,&quot; acquaintance,&quot; or &quot;date.&quot;  Such networks sometimes condense into a &lt;i&gt; milieu&lt;/i&gt;, where nothing is shared but codes, and where nothing is played out except the incessant recomposition of identity." -- The Invisible Committee]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["One the one hand, our economists treat human beings as rational actors making choices to maximize their own economic benefit.  On the other hand, the same companies that hire those economists also pay for advertising campaigns that use the raw materials of myth and magic to encourage people to act against their own best interests, whether it's a matter of buying overpriced fizzy sugar water or the much more serious matter of continuing to support the unthinking pursuit of business as usual in the teeth of approaching disaster." -- John Michael Greer]]>
