	    <![CDATA["There are two novels that can change a bookish fourteen-year old’s life: &lt;i&gt;[book:The Lord of the Rings|10254806]&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;[book:Atlas Shrugged|9365]&lt;/i&gt;. One is a childish fantasy that often engenders a lifelong obsession with its unbelievable heroes, leading to an emotionally stunted, socially crippled adulthood, unable to deal with the real world. The other, of course, involves orcs.&quot;

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Well, basically there are two sorts of opera,&quot; said Nanny, who also had the true witch's ability to be confidently expert on the basis of no experience whatsoever. &quot;There's your heavy opera, where basically people sing foreign and it goes like &quot;Oh oh oh, I am dyin', oh I am dyin', oh oh oh, that's what I'm doin'&quot;, and there's your light opera, where they sing in foreign and it basically goes &quot;Beer! Beer! Beer! Beer! I like to drink lots of beer!&quot;, although sometimes they drink champagne instead. That's basically all of opera, reely." -- Terry Pratchett]]>

	    <![CDATA["What sort of person,&quot; said Salzella patiently, &quot;sits down and writes a maniacal laugh? And all those exclamation marks, you notice? Five? A sure sign of someone who wears his underpants on his head. Opera can do that to a man." -- Terry Pratchett]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["We reached the old wolf in time to watch a fierce green fire dying in her eyes.  I realized then, and have known ever since, that there was something new to me in those eyes – something known only to her and to the mountain. I was young then, and full of trigger-itch; I thought that because fewer wolves meant more deer, that no wolves would mean hunters’ paradise. But after seeing the green fire die, I sensed that neither the wolf nor the mountain agreed with such a view." -- Aldo Leopold]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The last word in ignorance is the man who says of an animal or plant, &quot;What good is it?&quot; If the land mechanism as a whole is good, then every part is good, whether we understand it or not. If the biota, in the course of aeons, has built something we like but do not understand, then who but a fool would discard seemingly useless parts? To keep every cog and wheel is the first precaution of intelligent tinkering." -- Aldo Leopold]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Conservation is getting nowhere because it is incompatible with our Abrahamic concept of land. We abuse land because we regard it as a commodity belonging to us. When we see land as a community to which we belong, we may begin to use it with love and respect." -- Aldo Leopold]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Acts of creation are ordinarily reserved for gods and poets, but humbler folk may circumvent this restriction if they know how. To plant a pine, for example, one need be neither god nor poet; one need only own a shovel. By virtue of this curious loophole in the rules, any clodhopper may say: Let there be a tree - and there will be one." -- Aldo Leopold]]>
