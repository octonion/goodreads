		<description>
	    <![CDATA["S and M is only the expression in the bedroom of an oppressive-submissive relation which can happen also in the kitchen or at the factory, can happen between people of any gender. There is obviously something titillating about these relationships, but it isn't the sexual components that makes them ugly, they're uglier elsewhere. Nothing sexual is depraved. Only cruelty is depraved, and that's another matter." -- Marilyn French]]>

	    <![CDATA["Music isn't just a pleasure, a transient satisfaction. It's a need, a deep hunger; and when the music is right, it's joy. Love. A foretaste of heaven. A comfort in grief. 

Is it too much to think that perhaps God speaks to us sometimes through music? 

How, then, could I be so ungrateful as to refuse the message?" -- Orson Scott Card]]>

That's what they should call you guys, the non-voting generation. You think you can't fix anything until you fix yourselves. Well, let me be the first to tell you, you will never fix yourselves.

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["and so it came to pass that i was strapped to a gurney and covered in raw liver and slabs of beef that very quickly turned rancid under the bright spotlights. there exists a videotape somewhere that documents me being wheeled about the dance floor by two burly &quot;orderlies,&quot; while i desperately search for a bathroom big enough to accommodate the stretcher so i can do a bump of cocaine. watching me retch from the decomposing meat, and simultaneously fiend for drugs, makes for an entertaining time, indeed.

when i told my mother the extremes i went to in order to make a living, she just shook her head and said, &quot;now don't you wish you'd finished college, dear?&quot;

mothers are so wise, sometimes." -- James St. James]]>
