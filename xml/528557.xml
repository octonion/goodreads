	    <![CDATA["After the first glass of vodka
you can accept just about anything
of life even your own mysteriousness
you think it is nice that a box
of matches is purple and brown and is called La Petite and comes from Sweden
for they are words that you know and that is all you know words not their feelings or what they mean and you write because you know them not because you understand them because you don't you are stupid and lazy and will never be great but you do what you know because what else is there?" -- Frank O'Hara]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["And isn't the whole world yours? For how often you set it on fire with your love and saw it blaze and burn up and secretly replaced it with another world while everyone slept. You felt in such complete harmony with God, when every morning you asked him for a new earth, so that all the ones he had made could have their turn. You thought it would be shabby to save them and repair them; you used them up and held out your hands, again and again, for more world. For your love was equal to everything." -- Rainer Maria Rilke]]>

Chloroform, I guess.&quot;
Really?&quot; She brightened. It made her happy that the person she was marrying would commit crimes in the same way as she would." -- Sarah Shun-lien Bynum]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Tell me,' I said. 'Tell me when you notice me.'

I notice you going into church,' Joshua said. 'I notice your hair, how blond it is. But how in some light it looks like it has red in it. I notice the way you smell when we're close. And the way you walk when we're headed home from church and your family gets out of the Temple first. I notice how you are with your family and how you hold your little sisters. I've seen you stand out on your doorstep and look across the desert. I've watched you walk toward the Compound fence and then on past that. You've been walking for years." -- Carol Lynch Williams]]>
