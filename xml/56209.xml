	    <![CDATA["My friend's wiry arms were around me and he was leading me to the chair.
&quot;You're not hurt, Watson? For God's sake say that you're not hurt!&quot;
It was worth a wound -it was worth many wounds- to know the depth of loyalty and love which lay﻿ beyond that cold mask. The clear, hard eyes were dimmed for a moment, and the firm lips were shaking. For the one and only time I caught a glimpse of a great heart as well as of a great brain." -- Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]]>

But it's God's own wind none the less, and a cleaner, better, stronger land will lie in the sunshine when the storm has cleared." -- Arthur Conan Doyle]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["But there can be no grave for Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson...Shall they not always live in Baker Street? Are they not there this moment, as one writes? Outside, the hansoms rattle through the rain, and Moriarty plans his latest devilry. Within, the sea-coal flames upon the hearth and Holmes and Watson take their well-won case...So they still live for all that love them well; in a romantic chamber of the heart, in a nostalgic country of the mind, where it is always 1895." -- Vincent Starrett]]>

He is the organizer of half that is evil and of nearly all that is undetected in this great city, He is a genius, a philosopher, an abstract thinker. He has a brain of the first order. He sits motionless, like a spider in the center of its web, but that web has a thousand radiations, and he knows well every quiver of each of them. He does little himself. He only plans." -- Arthur Conan Doyle]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Holmes laughed. &quot;Watson insists that I am the dramatist in real life,&quot; said he. &quot;Some touch of the artist wells up within me, and calls insistently for a well-staged performance. Surely our profession, Mr. Mac, would be a drab and sordid one if we did not sometimes set the scene so as to glorify our results. The blunt accusation, the brutal tap upon the shoulder - what can one make of such a &lt;i&gt;denouement&lt;/i&gt;? But the quick inference, the subtle trap, the clever forecast of coming events, the triumphant vindication of bold theories - are these not the pride and the justification of our life's work? At the present moment you thrill with the glamour of the situation and the anticipation of the hunt. Where would be that thrill if I had been as definite as a timetable?" -- Arthur Conan Doyle]]>

&quot;No, indeed,&quot; I answered brusquely. &quot;My constitution has not got
over the Afghan campaign yet. I cannot afford to throw any extra
strain upon it.&quot;
He smiled at my vehemence. &quot;Perhaps you are right, Watson,&quot; he
said. &quot;I suppose that its influence is physically a bad one. I find
it, however, so transcendently stimulating and clarifying to the
mind that its secondary action is a matter of small moment." -- Arthur Conan Doyle]]>
