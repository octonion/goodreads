	    <![CDATA["Do you remember when everyone thought Bush (sr) had a mistress too&quot;&quot; he asks in the course of a Clinton era conversation. &quot;But she was rumored to be someone wealthy and Waspy, of course...The problem here is the goddamn Democrats, who sleep down, you see.  They love that white trash...And white trash loves publicity,so the Democrats are the ones who get into all the trouble.  As opposed to the Republicans.  They sleep up...Up, where all is Episcopalian and quiet as death itself, and no one ever has to hear a thing about it" -- Sue Miller]]>
