	    <![CDATA["Until and unless you discover that money is the root of all good, you ask for your own destruction.

Take your choice--there is no other." -- Ayn Rand]]>

	    <![CDATA["For if you suffer your people to be ill-educated, and their manners to be corrupted from their infancy, and then punish them for those crimes to which their first education disposed them, what else is to be concluded from this, but that you first make thieves and then punish them." -- Sir Thomas More]]>
