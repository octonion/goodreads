	    <![CDATA["This time is difficult, wait for me:
we will live it out vividly.
Give me your small hand:
we will rise and suffer,
we will feel and rejoice.

We are once more the pair
who lived in bristling places,
in harsh nests in the rock.
This time is difficult, wait for me
with a basket, with a shovel,
with your shoes and your clothes.

Now we need each other
not only for the carnations' sake,
not only to look for honey:
we need our hands
to wash with and to make fire,
and so let our difficult time
stand up to infinity
with four hands and four eyes." -- Pablo Neruda]]>

	    <![CDATA["I believe that if, at the end of it all, according to our abilities, we have done something to make others a little happier, and something to make ourselves a little happier, that is about the best we can do. To make others less happy is a crime. To make ourselves unhappy is where all crime starts. We must try to contribute joy to the world. That is true no matter what our problems, our health, our circumstances. We must try." -- Roger Ebert]]>
