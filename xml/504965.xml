	    <![CDATA["...the more risks you allow children to take, the better they learn to take care of themselves.  If you never let them take any risks, then I believe they become very prone to injury.  Boys should be allowed to climb tall trees and walk along the tops of high walls and dive into the sea from high rocks... The same with girls.  I like the type of child who takes risks.  Better by far than the one who never does so." -- Roald Dahl]]>

	    <![CDATA["Dignity is as essential to human life as water, food, and oxygen.  The stubborn retention of it, even in the face of extreme physical hardship, can hold a man's soul in his body long past the point at which the body should have surrendered it." -- Laura Hillenbrand]]>
