	    <![CDATA["I used to think she was quite intelligent , in my stupidity.  The reason I did was because she knew quite a lot about the theater and plays and literature and all that stuff.  If somebody knows quite a lot about all those things, it takes you quite a while to find out whether they're really stupid or not." -- J.D. Salinger]]>

	    <![CDATA["There was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified that a concern for one's safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind. Orr was crazy and could be grounded. All he had to do was ask; and as soon as he did, he would no longer be crazy and would have to fly more missions. Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn't, but if he was sane he had to fly them. If he flew them he was crazy and didn't have to; but if he didn't want to he was sane and had to. Yossarian was moved very deeply by the absolute simplicity of this clause of Catch-22 and let out a respectful whistle.

&quot;That's some catch, that Catch-22,&quot; he observed.

&quot;It's the best there is,&quot; Doc Daneeka agreed." -- Joseph Heller]]>

	    <![CDATA["I smiled, though looking at William K caused me concern.  He looked very ill, and he was my only mirror.  We could not see ourselves so I relied on the appearance of the other boys, William K in particular, to know something of my own health.  We ate the same food and were built in a similar way, so i watched him to see how thin i had become, how my eyes were growing more sunken.  On this day i did not look good." -- Dave Eggers]]>
