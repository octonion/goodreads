	    <![CDATA["I wish I could leave you certain of the images in my mind, because they are so beautiful that I hate to think they will be extinguished when I am.  Well, but again, this life has its own mortal loveliness.  And memory is not strictly mortal in its nature, either.  It is a strange thing, after all, to be able to return to a moment, when it can hardly be said to have any reality at all, even in its passing.  A moment is such a slight thing.  I mean, that its abiding is a most gracious reprieve." -- Marilynne Robinson]]>
