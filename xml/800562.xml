	    <![CDATA["As Michael pondered how shallow he had been, he was struck by another thought. It wasn't simply that he hadn't gone deep enough. It was rather that he had grown accustomed to wading in pools that had no depth to begin with. A turn toward holiness would be a turn toward a different life altogether - to a life where different things mattered than had mattered in the past. Did he desire such a life? He knew that of all the questions, this was the most important." -- James L. Ferrell]]>

	    <![CDATA["More than anything else we should be concerned about meekness, or our standing in God's sight.  If that standing is as it should be, nothing else matters.  If it is not, nothing else counts." -- John H. Groberg]]>

	    <![CDATA["One time I saw a tiny Joshua tree sapling growing not too far from the old tree.  I wanted to dig it up and replant it near our house.  I told Mom that I would protect it from the wind and water it every day so that it could grow nice and tall and straight.  Mom frowned at me.  &quot;You'd be destroying what makes it special,&quot; she said.  &quot;It's the Joshua tree's struggle that gives it its beauty." -- Jeannette Walls]]>
