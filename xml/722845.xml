	    <![CDATA["Whatever you do, you need courage. Whatever course you decide upon, there is always someone to tell you that you are wrong. There are always difficulties arising that tempt you to believe your critics are right. To map out a course of action and follow it to an end requires some of the same courage that a soldier needs. Peace has its victories, but it takes brave men and women to win them." -- Ralph Waldo Emerson]]>

	    <![CDATA["A fight is going on inside me,&quot; said an old man to his son. &quot;It is a terrible fight between two wolves. One wolf is evil. He is anger, envy, sorrow, regret, greed, arrogance, self-pity, guilt, resentment, inferiority, lies, false pride, superiority, and ego. The other wolf is good. he is joy, peace, love, hope, serenity, humility, kindness, benevolence, empathy, generosity, truth, compassion, and faith. The same fight is going on inside you.&quot; 

The son thought about it for a minute and then asked, &quot;Which wolf will win?&quot; 

The old man replied simply, &quot;The one you feed." -- Wendy Mass]]>
