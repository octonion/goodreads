	    <![CDATA["It's silly to be depressed by it.  I mean one thinks of it like being alive in a box, one keeps forgetting to take into account the fact that one is dead, which should make all the difference, shouldn't it?  I mean, you'd never know you were in a box would you?... Even taking into account the fact that you're dead, it isn't a pleasant thought.  Especially if you're dead, really.  Ask yourself, if I asked you straight off-- I'm going to stuff you in this box now would you rather be alive or dead?  Naturally you'd prefer to be alive.  Life in a box is better than no life at all." -- Tom Stoppard]]>
