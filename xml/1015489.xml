		<description>
	    <![CDATA["When animals express their feelings they pour out like water from a spout. Animals' emotions are raw, unfiltered, and uncontrolled. Their joy is the purest and most contagious of joys and their grief the deepest and most devastating. Their passions bring us to our knees in delight and sorrow." -- Marc Bekoff]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Perhaps one central reason for loving dogs is that they take us away from this obsession with ourselves. When our thoughts start to go in circles, and we seem unable to break away, wondering what horrible event the future holds for us, the dog opens a window into the delight of the moment." -- Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson]]>

It exists.. it is real.. it is possible.. it's yours." -- Ayn Rand]]>

	    <![CDATA["We who choose to surround ourselves
with lives even more temporary than our
own, live within a fragile circle;
easily and often breached.
Unable to accept its awful gaps,
we would still live no other way.
We cherish memory as the only
certain immortality, never fully
understanding the necessary plan." -- Irving Townsend]]>

	    <![CDATA["This is how it works.  I love the people in my life, and I do for my friends whatever they need me to do for them, again and again, as many times as is necessary.  For example, in your case you always forgot who you are and how much you're loved.  So what I do for you as your friend is remind you who you are and tell you how much I love you.  And this isn't any kind of burden for me, because I love who you are very much.  Every time I remind you, I get to remember with you, which is my pleasure." -- James Lecesne]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["What is family? They were the people who claimed you. In good, in bad, in parts or in whole, they were the ones who showed up, who stayed in there, regardless. It wasn't just about blood relations or shared chromosomes, but something wider, bigger. We had many families over time. Our family of origin, the family we created, and the groups you moved through while all of this was happening: friends, lovers, sometimes even strangers. None of them perfect, and we couldn't expect them to be. You can't make any one person your world. The trick was to take what each could give you and build your world from it." -- Sarah Dessen]]>

	    <![CDATA["From the backstabbing co-worker to the meddling sister-in-law, you are in charge of how you react to the people and events in your life.
