		<description>
	    <![CDATA["And when the event, the big change in your life, is simply an insightâ€”isn't that a strange thing? That absolutely nothing changes except that you see things differently and you're less fearful and less anxious and generally stronger as a result: isn't it amazing that a completely invisible thing in your head can feel realer than anything you've experienced before? You see things more clearly and you &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt; that you're seeing them more clearly.  And it comes to you that this is what it means to love life, this is all anybody who talks seriously about God is ever talking about.  Moments like this." -- Jonathan Franzen]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The creed which accepts as the foundation of morals, Utility, or the Greatest-Happiness Principle, holds that actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness, wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness. By happiness is intended pleasure, and the absence of pain; by unhappiness, pain, and the privation of pleasure." -- John Stuart Mill]]>
