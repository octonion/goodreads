		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Few people...have had much training in listening. The training of most oververbalized professional intellectuals is in the opposite direction. Living in a competitive culture, most of us are most of the time chiefly concerned with getting our own views across, and we tend to find other people's speeches a tedious interruption of the flow of our own ideas." -- S.I. Hayakawa]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Once my jars were labeled, I felt contentedly thrilled with myself, as if I had pulled off a wonderful trick.  People feel this way when they bake bread or have babies, and although they are perfectly entitled to feel that way, in fact, nature does most of the work." -- Laurie Colwin]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Imagine not being frightened by any feeling.  Imagine knowing that nothing will destroy you.  That you are beyond any feeling, an state.  Bigger than.  Vaster than.  That there is no reason to use drugs because anything a drug could do would pale in comparison to knowing who you are.  To what you can understand, live, be, just by being with that presents itself to you in the form of the feelings you have..." -- Geneen Roth]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA[". . . hell is wanting to be somewhere different from where you are.  Being one place and wanting to be somewhere else . . . .  Wanting life to be different from what it is.  That's also called leaving without leaving.  Dying before you die.  It's as if there is a part of you that so rails against being shattered by love that you shatter yourself first.  (p. 44)" -- Geneen Roth]]>
