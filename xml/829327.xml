	    <![CDATA["She stood looking carefully at the labeled portraits Ursala had put up: Little Crow, Chief of the Santees, Geronimo, last of the Apaches, and Ursala's favorite, Big Foot, dying in the snow at Wounded Knee.
&quot;Isn't that where the massacre was?&quot; asked Ellen.
&quot;Yes. I'm going to go there when I'm grown up.  To Wounded Knee.&quot;
&quot;That seems sensible,&quot; said Ellen." -- Eva Ibbotson]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Be grateful you’re not in the forest in France
Where the average young person just hasn’t a chance
To escape from the perilous pants eating plants
But your pants are safe, you’re a fortunate guy
You ought to be shouting how lucky am I" -- Dr. Seuss]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I think something must happen to you when you get into eight grade.  Like the Doug Swieteck's Brother Gene switches on and you become a jerk.  
Which may have been Hamlet, Prince of Denmark's problem, who, besides having a name that makes him sound like a breakfast special at Sunnyside Morning Restaurant--something between a ham slice and a three-egg omelet--didn't have the smarts to figure out that when someone takes the trouble to come back from beyond the grave to tell you that he's been murdered, it's probably behooveful to pay attention--which is the adjectival form." -- Gary D. Schmidt]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Think of the sound you make when you let go after holding your breath for a very, very long time.  Think of the gladdest sound you know: the sound of dawn on the first day of spring break, the sound of a bottle of Coke opening, the sound of a crowd cheering in your ears because you're coming down to the last part of a race--and you're ahead.  Think of the sound of water over stones in a cold stream, and the sound of wind through green trees on a late May afternoon in Central Park.  Think of the sound of a bus coming into the station carrying someone you love.  
Then put all those together." -- Gary D. Schmidt]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["After all, reading is arguably a far more creative and imaginative process than writing; when the reader creates emotion in their head, or the colors of the sky during the setting sun, or the smell of a warm summer's breeze on their face, they should reserve as much praise for themselves as they do for the writer - perhaps more." -- Jasper Fforde]]>
