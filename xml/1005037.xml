	    <![CDATA["Re-vision – the act of looking back, of seeing with fresh eyes, of entering an old text from a new critical direction – is for woman more than a chapter in cultural history: it is an act of survival.  Until we understand the assumptions in which we are drenched we cannot know ourselves.  And this drive to self-knowledge, for women, is more than a search for identity: it is part of our refusal of the self-destructiveness of male-dominated society." -- Adrienne Rich]]>

there was something i wanted
as badly as he wanted to fry himself" -- Don Marquis]]>

&quot;Can you have it done before we engage? Oh, good Lord,&quot; Laurence said, realizing. &quot;I do not even know the position of the convoy; do you?&quot; Granby shook his head, embarrassed, and Laurence swallowed his pride and shouted, &quot;Berkley, where are we going?&quot;

A general explosion of mirth ran among the men on Maximus's back. Berkley called back, &quot;Straight to Hell, ha ha!&quot; More laughter, nearly drowning out the coordinates that he bellowed over." -- Naomi Novik]]>
