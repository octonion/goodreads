	    <![CDATA["I experience religious dread whenever I find myself thinking that I know the limits of Godâ€™s grace, since I am utterly certain it exceeds any imagination a human being might have of it. God does, after all, so love the world." -- Marilynne Robinson]]>

	    <![CDATA["All these young mothers chauffeuring their volcanic three-year-olds through the grocery store. The child's name always sounds vaguely presidental, and he or she tends to act accordingly. &quot;Mommy hears what you're saying about treats,&quot; the woman will say, &quot;But right now she needs you to let go of her hair and put the chocolate-covered Life Savers back where they came from.&quot;

&quot;No!&quot; screams McKinley or Madison, Kennedy or Lincoln or beet-faced baby Reagan. Looking on, I always want to intervene. &quot;Listen,&quot; I'd like to say, &quot;I'm not a parent myself, but I think the best solution at this point is to slap that child across the face. It won't stop its crying, but at least now it'll be doing it for a good reason." -- David Sedaris]]>

	    <![CDATA["It bothered me that the bag bothered me more than head did, but what are you going to do? A person doesn't conciously choose what he focuses on. Those things choose you, and, once they do, nothing, it seems, can shake them." -- David Sedaris]]>

No ... eight days a week." -- Alan Bradley]]>
