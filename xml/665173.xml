	    <![CDATA["What is family? They were the people who claimed you. In good, in bad, in parts or in whole, they were the ones who showed up, who stayed in there, regardless. It wasn't just about blood relations or shared chromosomes, but something wider, bigger. We had many families over time. Our family of origin, the family we created, and the groups you moved through while all of this was happening: friends, lovers, sometimes even strangers. None of them perfect, and we couldn't expect them to be. You can't make any one person your world. The trick was to take what each could give you and build your world from it." -- Sarah Dessen]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Music is a total constant. That's why we have such a strong visceral connection to it, you know? Because a song can take you back instantly to a moment, or a place, or even a person. No matter what else has changed in your or the world, that one song says the same, just like that moment." -- Sarah Dessen]]>

	    <![CDATA["We have to go 1000 oceans wide
1000 dark years time time has died
1000 stars are passing by
We have to go 1000 oceans wide
1000 times against an endless tide
We'll be free to live our life I know somewhere" -- Tokio Hotel]]>
