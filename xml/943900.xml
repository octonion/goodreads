	    <![CDATA["...it occurred to me that I could use the energy I had been putting into endurance to change my life. Yet the concept of brunt, of accepting and enduring, still seems to me to have a kind of nobility. It is, perhaps, less intelligent, but there is a stubborn selfhood about it that is dear to me. It can be, quite literally, the only way to survive." -- Anne Truitt]]>

	    <![CDATA["We tend to mix genders when we arrange ourselves around a table for meetings.  A sort of accommodation is made by the men for the women: they make space for us.  they are ever-so-slightly polite, we are ever-so-slightly grateful.  When we stand up at the end of a meeting, we all give ourselves a metaphorical shake that is only partly the relief of having concluded our business: we are all released from the effort of fitting ourselves together.
When men speak in these meetings, women relax; when women speak, men grow tense.  I have the impression that they never know what a woman is going to say, whereas they are reasonably sure what a man will address himself to and how he will do it.  So are the women; for them, too, men tend to be predictable.  Women listen to women with a different kind of attention, and part of it may be loyalty to our gender; we want all of us to do well, as if we have the esprit de corps of subalterns among generals." -- Anne Truitt]]>
