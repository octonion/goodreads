	    <![CDATA["No sight so sad as that of a naughty child,&quot; he began, &quot;especially a naughty little girl. Do you know where the wicked go after death?&quot;

&quot;They go to hell,&quot; was my ready and orthodox answer.

&quot;And what is hell? Can you tell me that?&quot;

&quot;A pit full of fire.&quot;

&quot;And should you like to fall into that pit, and to be burning there for ever?&quot;

&quot;No, sir.&quot;

&quot;What must you do to avoid it?&quot;

I deliberated a moment: my answer, when it did come was objectionable: &quot;I must keep in good health and not die." -- Charlotte Brontë]]>

	    <![CDATA["Isabelle drifted over, Jace a pace behind her. She was wearing a long black dress with boots and an even longer cutaway coat of soft green velvet, the color of moss. &quot;I can't believe you did it!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;How did you get Magnus to let Jace leave?&quot;
&quot;Traded him for Alec,&quot; Clary said.
Isabelle looked mildly alarmed. &quot;Not permanently?&quot;
&quot;No,&quot; said Jace. &quot;Just for a few hours. Unless I don't come back,&quot; he added thoughtfully. &quot;In which case, maybe he does get to keep Alec. Think of it as a lease with an option to buy.&quot;
Isabelle looked dubious. &quot;Mom and Dad won't be pleased if they find out.&quot;
&quot;That you freed a possible criminal by trading away your brother to a warlock who looks like a gay Sonic the Hedgehog and dresses like the Child Catcher from Chitty Chitty Bang Bang?&quot; Simon inquired. &quot;No, probably not." -- Cassandra Clare]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Inigo was in despair.

Hard to find on the map (this was after maps) not because cartographers didn’t know of its existence, but because when they visited to measure its precise dimensions, they became so depressed they began to drink and question everything, most notably why anyone would want to be something as stupid as a cartographer. It required constant travel, no one ever knew your name, and, most of all, why bother? There grew up, then, a gentleman’s agreement among mapmakers of the period to keep the place as secret as possible, lest tourists flock there and die. (Should you insist on paying a visit, it’s closer to the Baltic States than most places.)" -- William Goldman]]>

Secretly they wonder when the statute of limitations on asking expires (its three months, by the way. Written or unwritten, that's about all the time it takes for people to forget the one thing that you never will)." -- Sarah Ockler]]>
