	    <![CDATA["In consequence I'm inclined to reserve all judgements, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores.  The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person, and so it came that in college I was unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men.  Most of the confidences were unsought - frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation or a hostile levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon - for the intimate revelations of young men or at least the terms in which they express them are usually plagaristic and marred by obvious suppressions." -- F. Scott Fitzgerald]]>

	    <![CDATA["No sight so sad as that of a naughty child,&quot; he began, &quot;especially a naughty little girl. Do you know where the wicked go after death?&quot;

&quot;They go to hell,&quot; was my ready and orthodox answer.

&quot;And what is hell? Can you tell me that?&quot;

&quot;A pit full of fire.&quot;

&quot;And should you like to fall into that pit, and to be burning there for ever?&quot;

&quot;No, sir.&quot;

&quot;What must you do to avoid it?&quot;

I deliberated a moment: my answer, when it did come was objectionable: &quot;I must keep in good health and not die." -- Charlotte Brontë]]>
