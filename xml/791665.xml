	    <![CDATA["When you are five, you know your age down to the month.  Even in your twenties, you know how old you are. I'm twenty-three you say, or maybe twenty-seven. But then in your thirties, something strange starts to happen.  It is a mere hiccup at first, an instant of hesitation.  How old are you?  Oh, I'm--you start confidently, but then you stop.  You were going to say thirty-three, but you are not.  You're thirty-five.  And then you're bothered, because you wonder if this is the beginning of the end.  It is, of course, but it's decades before you admit it." -- Sara Gruen]]>
