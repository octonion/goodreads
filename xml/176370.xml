		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I've always known that the best part of writing occurs before you've picked up a pen. When a story exists only in your mind, its potential is infinite; it's only when you start pinning words to paper that it becomes less than perfect. You have to make your choices, set your limits. Start whittling away at the cosmos, and don't stop until you've narrowed it down to a single, ordinary speck of dirt. And in the end, what you've made is not nearly as glorious as what you've thrown away." -- Carolyn Parkhurst]]>

	    <![CDATA["Sorry, old girl,&quot; I said to [my bicycle] Gladys in the gray dishwater light of early morning, &quot;but I have to leave you at home.&quot;

I could see that she was disappointed, even though she managed to put on a brave face.

&quot;I need you to stay here as a decoy,&quot; I whispered. &quot;When they see you leaning against the greenhouse, they'll think I'm still in bed.&quot; 

Gladys brightened considerably at the thought of a conspiracy. [...]

At the corner of the garden, I turned, and mouthed the words, &quot;Don't do anything I wouldn't do,&quot; and Gladys signaled that she wouldn't.

I was off like a shot." -- Alan Bradley]]>
