	    <![CDATA["When his life was ruined, his family killed, his farm destroyed, Job knelt down on the ground and yelled up to the heavens, &quot;Why god? Why me?&quot; and the thundering voice of God answered, There's just something about you that pisses me off." -- Stephen King]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["There are books full of great writing that don't have very good stories. Read sometimes for the story... don't be like the book-snobs who won't do that. Read sometimes for the words--the language. Don't be like the play-it-safers who won't do that. But when you find a book that has both a good story and good words, treasure that book." -- Stephen King]]>

	    <![CDATA["Change isn't easy... changing the way you live means changing what you believe about life. That's hard... When we make our own misery, we sometimes cling to it even when we want so bad to change because the misery is something we know. The misery is comfortable." -- Dean Koontz]]>
