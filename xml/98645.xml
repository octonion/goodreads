	    <![CDATA["Wish you could turn off the questions, turn off the voices, turn off all sound.
Yearn to close out the ugliness, close out the filthiness, close out all light.
Long to cast away yesterday, cast away memory, cast away all jeapordy.
Pray you could somehow stop uncertainty, somehow stop the loathing, somehow stop the pain.
Act on your impulse, swallow the bottle, cut a little deeper, put the gun to your chest." -- Ellen  Hopkins]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Memory is a tenuous thing. . . .

flickering glimpses, blue
and white, like ancient,
decomposing 16mm film.
Happiness escapes
me there, where faces
are vague and yesterday
seems to come tied
up in ribbons of pain.

Happiness?  I look for it intead
in today, where memory
is something I can still
touch, still rely on.
I find it in the smiles
of new friends, the hope
blossoming inside.

My happiest memories
have no place in the
past; they are those
I have yet to create." -- Ellen Hopkins]]>

	    <![CDATA["Losing It

Some days I think
I'm losing my mind.
What seems so 
                                clear
most of the time
becomes a big question mark.
Am I really                    
                                the way
I percieve myself, or
is the person others see
the truth of me? I wait
                                for
answers, but inside 
I know I have to go out
and find them. And
                                answers
like knowledge, are 
not always where we
first look for them." -- Ellen Hopkins]]>

	    <![CDATA["Eyes Tell Stories
But do they know how
to craft fiction? Do
they know how to spin
lies?
His eyes swear forever,
flatter with vows of only
me. But are they empty
promises?
I stare into his eyes, as
into a crystal ball, but
I cannot find forever,
only
movies of yesterday,
a sketchbook of today,
dreams of a shared
tomorrow.
His eyes whisper secrets.
But are they truths or fairy tales?
I wonder if even he
knows." -- Ellen  Hopkins]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Girls get screwed.
Not that kind of screwed, what I mean is, they're always on the short end of things.

The way things work, how 
guys feel great, but make girls feel
cheap for doing
exactly what 
they beg for.

The way they get to play you, 
all the while claiming they 
love you and making you 
believe it's 
true.

The way it's okay to gift their heart one day, a backhand the next, 
to move on to the apricot
when the peach blushes and bruises.

These things make me believe God's a man after all." -- Ellen  Hopkins]]>
