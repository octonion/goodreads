	    <![CDATA["Do any of us, except in our dreams, truly expect to be reunited with our hearts' deepest loves, even when they leave us only for minutes, and on the most mundane of errands?  No, not at all. Each time they go from our sight we in our secret hearts count them as dead. Having been given so much, we reason, how could we expect not to be brought as low as Lucifer for the staggering presumption of our love?" -- Stephen King]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Some birds are not meant to be caged, that's all.  Their feathers are too bright, their songs too sweet and wild.

And the part of you that knows it was wrong to imprison them in the first place rejoices, but still, the place where you live is that much more drab and empty for their departure." -- Stephen King]]>
