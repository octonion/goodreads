	    <![CDATA["Believe in yourself.  Believe in your capacity to do great and good things.  Believe that no mountain is so high that you cannot climb it.  Believe that no storm is so great that you cannot weather it.  You are not destined to be a scrub.  You are a child of God, of infinite capacity.

Believe that you can do it whatever it is that you set your heart on.  Opportunities will unfold and open before you.  The skies will clear when they have been dark with portent...He who is our Eternal Father has blessed you with miraculous powers of mind and body.  He never intended that you should be less than the crowning glory of His creations." -- Gordon B. Hinckley]]>
