	    <![CDATA["When afterwards he mentioned the names of the Tartars he had got to know on his pilgrimage, like Hallimulabalibay, to which he added a whole string of names he had himself invented, like Valivolavalivey, Malimulamalimey, Lieutenant Lukas could not stop himself from sying: 'I'll kick your backside, you mule. Go on, and be brief and to the point!" -- Jaroslav Hasek]]>

	    <![CDATA["The only writers who have any peace are the ones who don't write. And there are some like that. They wallow in a sea of possibilities.
