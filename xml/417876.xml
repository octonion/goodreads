	    <![CDATA["It is extraordinarily entertaining to watch the historians of the past ... entangling themselves in what they were pleased to call the &quot;problem&quot; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/579166.Elizabeth_I&quot;&gt;Queen Elizabeth&lt;/a&gt;.  They invented the most complicated and astonishing reasons both for her success as a sovereign and for her tortuous matrimonial policy.  She was the tool of Burleigh, she was the tool of Leicester, she was the fool of Essex; she was diseased, she was deformed, she was a man in disguise.  She was a mystery, and must have some extraordinary solution.  Only recently has it occrurred to a few enlightened people that the solution might be quite simple after all.  She might be one of the rare people were born into the right job and put that job first." -- Dorothy L. Sayers]]>
