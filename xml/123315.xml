And light. And flight. The one who builds a city, a nation, an empire...I'll put it bluntly. Human beings are free excpet when humanity needs them. Maybe humanity needs you. To do something. Maybe humanity needs me - to find out what you're good for." -- Orson Scott Card]]>

Lord, it would be better to be born without an arm than to go through life with no guts." -- Katherine Paterson]]>
