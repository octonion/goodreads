you wanted from this life, even so?
I did.
And what did you want?

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["And since that is not how it has been for a long time, you want, this time, to make it last, this glistening one moment, this cool air, this new living, so that you can preserve a feeling of it, inasmuch as when it comes again it may just be too late. You may just be too old. And in truth, of course, this may be the last time that you will ever feel this way again." -- Richard Ford]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I have learned that if you must leave a place that you have lived in and loved and where all your yesteryears are buried deep, leave it any way except a slow way, leave it the fastest way you can.  Never turn back and never believe that an hour you remember is a better hour because it is dead.  Passed years seem safe ones, vanquished ones, while the future lives in a cloud, formidable from a distance." -- Beryl Markham]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["You can live a lifetime and, at the end of it, know more about other people than you know about yourself. You learn to watch other people, but you never watch yourself because you strive against loneliness. If you read a book, or shuffle a deck of cards, or care for a dog, you are avoiding yourself. The abhorrence of loneliness is as natural as wanting to live at all. If it were otherwise, men would never have bothered to make an alphabet, nor to have fashioned words out of what were only animal sounds, nor to have crossed continents - each man to see what the other looked like." -- Beryl Markham]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I had never realized before how quickly men deteriorate without razors and clean shirts.  They are like potted plants that go to weed unless they are pruned and tended daily.  A single day's growth beard makes a man look careless; two days', derelict; and four days', polluted.  Blix and Weston hadn't shaved for three." -- Beryl Markham]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["You expected to be sad in the fall. Part of you died each year when the leaves fell from the trees and their branches were bare against the wind and the cold, wintery light. But you knew there would always be the spring, as you knew the river would flow again after it was frozen. When the cold rains kept on and killed the spring, it was as though a young person died for no reason." -- Ernest Hemingway]]>
