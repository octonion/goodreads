Not in our day, but at no distant one, we may shake a rod over the heads of all, which may make the stoutest of them tremble. &lt;b&gt;But I hope our wisdom will grow with our power, and teach us, that &lt;i&gt;the less we use our power, the greater it will be&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;." -- Thomas Jefferson]]>
