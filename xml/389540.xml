		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The temptation is to stay inside; to subside into the kind of recluse whom neighborhood children regard with derision and little awe; to let the hedges and weeds grow up, to allow the doors to rust shut, to lie on my bed in some gown-shaped garment and let my hair lengthens and spread out over the pillow and my fingernails to sprout into claws, while candle wax drips onto the carpet. But long ago I made a choice between classicism and romanticism. I prefer to be upright and contained—an urn in daylight." -- Margaret Atwood]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["What is it that you contain?  The dead.  Time.  Light patterns of millennia opening in your gut.  Every minute, in each of you, a few million potassium atoms succumb to radioactive decay.  The energy that powers these tiny atomic events has been locked inside potassium atoms ever since a star-sized bomb exploded nothing into being.  Potassium, like uranium and radium, is a long-lived radioactive nuclear waste of the supernova bang that accounts for you.

Your first parent was a star." -- Jeanette Winterson]]>
