	    <![CDATA["You know, sometimes I'll go to an 8th-grade graduation and there's all that pomp and circumstance and gowns and flowers.  And I think to myself, it's just 8th grade ... An 8th-grade education doesn't cut it today.  Let's give them a handshake and tell them to get their butts back in the library!" -- Barack Obama]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The very act of story-telling, of arranging memory and invention according to the structure of the narrative, is by definition holy.  We tell stories because we can't help it.  We tell stories because we love to entertain and hope to edify.   We tell stories because they fill the silence death imposes.  We tell stories because they save us." -- James Carroll]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Whether they realized it or not, they were doubting possibility, and the unknown. They believed I would fail. And when we only believe what has been said before, what has been done before, we give our own power away. Possibility evaporates; potential melts and seeps away deep into the earth below us. We cut ourselves short by thinking this way. I have always felt that it is from what we believe that our lives are created, not the other way around." -- Shreve Stockton]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["There are stars whose radiance is visible on Earth though they have long been extinct. There are people whose brilliance continues to light the world even though they are no longer among the living. These lights are particularly bright when the night is dark. They light the way for humankind." -- Hannah Senesh]]>

	    <![CDATA["Love is like a precious plant. You can't just accept it and leave it in the cupboard or just think it's going to get on by itself. You've got to keep on watering it. You've got to really look after it and nurture it." -- John Lennon]]>
