	    <![CDATA["...when the bullets fly and sundry erratic fragments of shell are seeking
a fellowʼs life, and he has to lay low in the pits to keep his light from being snuffed
out, then is a good opportunity to reckon up and balance accounts with the world
in general and a fellowʼs near relatives and family in particular. Many, many,
many a time have I thought of the careless word or deed never recalled, or
amended, and during those midnight hours would I have given almost life itself to
have the opportunity of making amends for them. Not through fear of what is
beyond this life, but in order that after my flesh had turned to dust, and my bones
to traces of white lime, those that knew me in life could say, “Charlie is gone, and
though his life was full of inconsistencies, still he was a good hearted fellow, and
if he did not amount to much as man, still he done no one any harm.” Charlie Biddlecom January 22, 1865" -- Katherine M. Aldridge]]>
