Consider and judge your actions, for they have become your habits. Acknowledge and watch your habits, for they shall become your values. Understand and embrace your values, for they become your destiny." -- Mahatma Gandhi]]>

	    <![CDATA["Само поетът и лудия могат
само със двеста другари
голи да влязат във живия огън
и крепост с глава да събарят.
Само поетът и лудият дръзват
С юмрук да трошат вековете!
Българио, майко, горд съм до сълзи,
Че раждаш и „луди“ поети!" -- Дамян Дамянов]]>

	    <![CDATA["Security is mostly a superstition. It does not exist in nature, nor do the children of men as a whole experience it. Avoiding danger is no safer in the long run than outright exposure. Life is either a daring adventure, or nothing." -- Helen Keller]]>

	    <![CDATA["Things just happen in the right way, at the right time.  At least when you let them, when you work with circumstances instead of saying, 'This isn't supposed to be happening this way,' and trying harder to make it happen some other way." -- Benjamin Hoff]]>
