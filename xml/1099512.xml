	    <![CDATA["His soul sat up. It met me. Those kinds of souls always do - the best ones. The ones who rise up and say &quot;I know who you are and I am ready. Not that I want to go, of course, but I will come.&quot; Those souls are always light because more of them have been put out. More of them have already found their way to other places." -- Markus Zusak]]>
