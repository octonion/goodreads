	    <![CDATA["My grandfather would have loved to have met you,&quot; he told her huskily. &quot;He would have called you 'She Moves Trees Out of His Path.' &quot;

       She looked lost, but his da laughed. He'd known the old man, too.

       &quot;He called me 'He Who Must Run into Trees,'&quot; Charles explained, and in a spirit of honesty, a need for his mate to know who he was, he continued, &quot;or sometimes 'Running Eagle.' &quot;

        &quot; 'Running Eagle'?&quot; Anna puzzled it over, frowning at him. &quot;What's wrong with that?&quot;

     &quot;Too stupid to fly,&quot; murmured his father with a little smile." -- Patricia Briggs]]>

	    <![CDATA["Adam swore harshly. &quot;New werewolves are dangerous, woman. Especially when they are cold and hungry.&quot; He looked at Mac, and his voice changed completely, the heat and anger gone, &quot;Mercy, come here.&quot; 

I didn't look down to see what he'd noticed in Mac's face. I took a step, but Mac was wrapped around my left leg. I stopped before I fell. &quot;Uhm. I'm a little stuck for the moment." -- Patricia Briggs]]>
