	    <![CDATA["I am as wrapped up in her as a vine that clings to a tree seeking for sustenance.  She’s tied me to her for eternity.  She’s my home.  She’s my reason for being.  To win and hold her heart is my only purpose." -- Colleen Houck]]>

	    <![CDATA["Wow.  I didn’t think it was possible for him to look any more intoxicating than he already did.  But a leather clad Ren standing next to the gorgeous racing motorcycle holding his helmet made my brain go numb.  I had kind of a this-is-your-brain-on-drugs moment, only mine was more like a this-is-your-brain-on-seeing-Ren-in-tight-leather moment.  If they’d been smart, the Ducati Company should have used him in a commercial and given him the bike for free." -- Colleen Houck]]>
