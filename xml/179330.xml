		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Since the purpose of reading, of education, is to become good, our most important task is to choose the right books. Our personal set of stories, our canon, shapes our lives. I believe it is a law of the universe that we will not rise above our canon. Our canon is part of us, deeply, subconsciously. And the characters and teachings in our canon shape our characters--good, evil, mediocre, or great." -- Oliver DeMille]]>

	    <![CDATA["Books are better than television, the internet, or the computer for &lt;i&gt;educating and maintaining freedom.&lt;/i&gt;
Books matter because they state ideas and then attempt to thoroughly prove them. They have an advantage &lt;i&gt;precisely because they slow down the process,&lt;/i&gt; allowing the reader to internalize, respond, react and transform. The ideas in books matter because time is taken to establish truth, and because the reader must take the time to consider each idea and either accept it or, if he rejects it, to think through sound reasons for doing so. A nation of people who write and read is a nation with the attention span to earn an education and free society if they choose." -- Oliver DeMille]]>

	    <![CDATA["I was the lion who forced you to join with Aravis. I was the cat who comforted you among the houses of the dead. I was the lion who drove the jackals from you while you slept. I was the lion who gave the horses the new strength of fear for the last mill so that you should reach King Lune in time. And I was the lion you do not remember who pushed the boat in which you lay, a child near death, so that it came to shore where a man sat, wakeful at midnight, to receive you." -- C.S. Lewis]]>
