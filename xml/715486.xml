Vive porque a vida dura.
Nada na alma lhe diz

Ter por vida a sepultura." -- Fernando Pessoa]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["His gaze, blunted
by the unnumbered procession
of iron bars, uncounted
as his softly padded steps.

Smooth motion of blood and sinew
turning in its own, small circle
prescribed by bars and walls
...and skin, confined.

Suddenly, without warning,
a flash of light and image
pierces the caged brain,
and passing through its beating heart
to stillness finds its way. " -- Rilke Rainer Maria]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["One beautiful evening the not less beautiful minor government official Ivan Cherviakov was sitting in the second row of the orchestra looking through his opera-glasses at Les Cloches de Corneville. As he sat there he felt himself to be in the seventh heaven of happiness. But suddenly (in stories one often finds this ´suddenly´ authorsare right - life is full of the unexpected), suddenly his face grew wrinkled, his eyes rolled, and he held his breath - he took down his opera-glasses, bent forward, and - ha-choo ! He sneezed, as you see. (...) He saw that an old man who was sitting in front of him in the first row was painfully wiping his bald spot and the back of his neck with his glove and muttering something. In this old man Cherviakov recognized General Brizialov of the Department of Highways " -- Anton Chekhov]]>

	    <![CDATA["When we got to the part where we had to improvise an argument in a poetic language, I got cold feet. &quot;I can't do this,&quot; I said. &quot;I don't know what to say.&quot;

&quot;Say anything,&quot; he said. &quot;You can't make a mistake when you improvise.&quot;

&quot;What if I mess it up? What if I screw up the rhythm?&quot;

&quot;You can't,&quot; he said. &quot;It's like drumming. If you miss a beat, you create another.&quot;

In this simple exchange, Sam taught me the secret of improvisation, one that I have accessed my whole life." -- Patti Smith]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["If one wanted to depict the whole thing graphically, every episode, with its climax, would require a three-dimensional, or, rather, no model: every experience is unrepeatable. What makes lovemaking and reading resemble each other most is that within both of them times and spaces open, different from measurable time and space." -- Italo Calvino]]>

	    <![CDATA["July had already been a busy month as Twitter had also moved into new offices: a fancy, modern, loftlike space with lots of windows and room to grow. Among the fun features they had added to the office (a living-room setup with a couch and video games, a large red phone booth, and a fully stocked kitchen with cereal and other snacks), Jack had suggested putting in a Radiohead room. “It can play Radiohead twenty-four hours a day!” he said excitedly when suggesting the idea." -- Nick Bilton]]>

	    <![CDATA["An astronomer, a physicist, and a mathematician (it is said) were holidaying in Scotland. Glancing from a train window, they observed a black sheep in the middle of a field. “How interesting,” observed the astronomer, “all Scottish sheep are black!” To which the physicist responded, “No, no! Some Scottish sheep are black!” The mathematician gazed heavenward in supplication, and then intoned, “In Scotland there exists at least one field, containing at least one sheep, at least one side of which is black." -- Simon Singh]]>
