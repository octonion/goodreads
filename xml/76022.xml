	    <![CDATA["Songs remain. They last. The right song can turn an emperor into a laughingstock, can bring down dynasties. A song can last long after the events and the people in it are dust and dreams and gone. That’s the power of songs." -- Neil Gaiman]]>

I’m not going back there again; I’d rather stay in for the rest of my life than attract that kind of attention." -- Nick Hornby]]>
