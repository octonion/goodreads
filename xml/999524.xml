		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Perhaps it was the word &quot;God&quot; that was inviting to me, a word I thought I knew too much about. The one who had tortured Job, who had Abraham lift the ax to his son, who, disguised as a whale, had swallowed Jonah. I know now that the name does not refer to any deity, but means simply to call out and pray, to summon." -- Linda Hogan]]>
