		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Time is more complex near the sea than in any other place, for in addition to the circling of the sun and the turning of the seasons, the waves beat out the passage of time on the rocks and the tides rise and fall as a great clepsydra." -- John Steinbeck]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I've crossed these sands many times,&quot; said one of the camel drivers one night. &quot;But the desert is so huge, and the horizons so distant, that they make a person feel small, and as if he should remain silent.&quot;

The boy understood intuitively what he meant, even without ever having set foot in the desert before. Whenever he saw the sea, or a fire, he fell silent, impressed by their elemental force." -- Paulo Coelho]]>

	    <![CDATA["When Kino had finished, Juana came back to the fire and ate her breakfast. They had spoken once, but there is not need for speech if it is only a habit anyway. Kino sighed with satisfaction - and that was conversation." -- John Steinbeck]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["There was a time in my demented youth
When somehow I suspected that the truth
About survival after death was known
To every human being: I alone
Knew nothing, and a great conspiracy
Of books and people hid the truth from me." -- Vladimir Nabokov]]>

	    <![CDATA["My dream is to walk around the world. A smallish backpack, all essentials neatly in place. A camera. A notebook. A traveling paint set. A hat. Good shoes. A nice pleated (green?) skirt for the occasional seaside hotel afternoon dance." -- Maira Kalman]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Be patient toward all that is unsolved in your heart and try to love the questions themselves, like locked rooms and like books that are now written in a very foreign tongue. Do not now seek the answers, which cannot be given you because you would not be able to live them. And the point is, to live everything. Live the questions now. Perhaps you will then gradually, without noticing it, live along some distant day into the answer." -- Rainer Maria Rilke]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["One of us had loved the other more perfectly, had watched the other more closely, and one of us listened and the other hadnâ€™t, and one of us held on to the ambition of the one idea far longer than was reasonable, whereas the other, passing a garbage can one night, had casually thrown it away." -- Nicole Krauss]]>
