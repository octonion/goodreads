	    <![CDATA["I'm coming back into focus when Caesar asks him if he has a girlfriend back home. Peeta hesitates, then gives an unconvincing shake of his head.

Handsome lad like you. There must be some special girl. Come on, what’s her name?&quot; says Caesar.

Peeta sighs. &quot;Well, there is this one girl. I’ve had a crush on her ever since I can remember. But I’m pretty sure she didn’t know I was alive until the reaping.&quot;

Sounds of sympathy from the crowd. Unrequited love they can relate to.

She have another fellow?&quot; asks Caesar.

I don’t know, but a lot of boys like her,&quot; says Peeta.

So, here’s what you do. You win, you go home. She can’t turn you down then, eh?&quot; says Caesar encouragingly.

I don’t think it’s going to work out. Winning...won’t help in my case,&quot; says Peeta.

Why ever not?&quot; says Caesar, mystified.

Peeta blushes beet red and stammers out. &quot;Because...because...she came here with me." -- Suzanne Collins]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I spent my life folded between the pages of books.
In the absence of human relationships I formed bonds with paper characters. I lived love and loss through stories threaded in history; I experienced adolescence by association. My world is one interwoven web of words, stringing limb to limb, bone to sinew, thoughts and images all together. I am a being comprised of letters, a character created by sentences, a figment of imagination formed through fiction." -- Tahereh Mafi]]>

	    <![CDATA["&lt;b&gt;Do not go gentle into that good night&lt;/b&gt;

Do not go gentle into that good night, 
Old age should burn and rage at close of day; 
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
Though wise men at their end know dark is right, 
Because their words had forked no lightning they 
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright 
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay, 
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight, 
And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way, 
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight 
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay, 
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

And you, my father, there on the sad height, 
Curse, bless me now with your fierce tears, I pray. 
Do not go gentle into that good night. 
Rage, rage against the dying of the light." -- Dylan Thomas]]>

	    <![CDATA["I admit I get the occasional headache,&quot; I said.  &quot;I admit some of my hangovers are epic.  But usually all it takes for me to bounce back is a sauna, cold-plunge pool, steam bath, massage, and wasabi to clear the sinuses&quot;." -- George Gurley]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["She craved a presence beside her, solid. Fingertips light at the nape of her neck and a voice meeting hers in the dark. Someone who would wait with an umbrella to walk her home in the rain, and smile like sunshine when he saw her coming. Who would dance with her on her balcony, keep his promises and know her secrets, and make a tiny world wherever he was, with just her and his arms and his whisper and her trust." -- Laini Taylor]]>
