	    <![CDATA["Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres." -- Anonymous]]>

	    <![CDATA["Fang’s hand gently smoothed my hair off my neck. My breath froze in my chest, and every sense seemed hyperalert. His hand stroked my hair again, so softly, and then trailed across my neck and shoulder and down my back, making me shiver.
I looked up. “What the heck are you doing?”
“Helping you change your mind,” he whispered, and then he leaned over, tilted my chin up, and kissed me." -- James Patterson]]>

	    <![CDATA["Don’t ever leave me again,” I said in a tiny voice.
I won’t,” he promised into my hair, sounding most un-Fang-like. “I won’t. Not ever.”
And just like that, a cold shard of ice that had been inside my chest ever since we’d split up-well, it just disappeared. I felt myself relax for the first time in I don’t known how long. The wind was chilly, but the sun was bright, and my whole flock was together. Fang and I were together.
Excuse me? I’m alive too.” Iggy’s plaintive voice made me pull back." -- James Patterson]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["A story is alive, as you and I are. It is rounded by muscle and sinew. Rushed with blood. Layered with skin, both rough and smooth. At its core lies soft marrow of hard, white bone. A story beats with the heart of every person who has ever strained ears to listen. On the breath of the storyteller, it soars. Until its images and deeds become so real you can see them in the air, shimmering like oases on the horizon line. A story can fly like a bee, so straight and swift you catch only the hum of its passing. Or move so slowly it seems motionless, curled in upon itself like a snake in the sun. It can vanish like smoke before the wind. Linger like perfume in the nose. Change with every telling, yet always remain the same." -- Cameron Dokey]]>

Gazzy thought. &quot;I have X-ray vision,&quot; he said. He peered at ter Borcht's chest, then blinked and looked alarmed.
Ter Borcht was startled for a second, but then he frowned. &quot;Don't write dat down,&quot; he told his assistant in irritation. The assistant froze in midsentence.
&quot;You. Do you haf any qualities dat distinguish you in any way?&quot;
Nudge chewed on a fingernail. &quot;You mean, like, besides the WINGS?&quot; She shook her shoulders gently, and her beautiful fawn-colored wings unfolded a bit.
His face flushed, and I felt like cheering. &quot;Yes,&quot; he said stiffly. &quot;Besides de vings.&quot;
&quot;Hmm. Besides de vings.&quot; Nudge tapped one finger against her chin. &quot;Um...&quot; Her face brightened. &quot;I once ate nine Snickers bars in one sitting. Without barfing. That was a record!&quot;
&quot;Hardly a special talent,&quot; ter Borcht said witheringly. 
Nudge was offended. &quot;Yeah? Let's see YOU do it.&quot;

Iggy rubbed his forehead with one hand. &quot;Well, I have a highly developed sense of irony.&quot;
Ter Borcht tsked. &quot;You are a liability to your group. I assume you alvays hold on to someone's shirt, yes? Following dem closely?&quot;
&quot;Only when I'm trying to steal their dessert&quot;
...Fang pretended to think, gazing up at the ceiling. &quot;Besides my fashion sense? I play a mean harmonica.&quot;
&quot;I vill now destroy de Snickuhs bahrs!&quot; Gazzy barked." -- James Patterson]]>
