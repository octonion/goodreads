		<description>
	    <![CDATA["People say that what we’re all seeking is a meaning for life. I don’t think that’s what we’re really seeking. I think that what we’re seeking is an experience of being alive, so that our life experiences on the purely physical plane will have resonances with our own innermost being and reality, so that we actually feel the rapture of being alive." -- Joseph Campbell]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The only reason we don't open our hearts and minds to other people is that they trigger confusion in us that we don't feel brave enough or sane enough to deal with. To the degree that we look clearly and compassionately at ourselves, we feel confident and fearless about looking into someone else's eyes. " -- Pema Chodron]]>

Into a single cloth –

And clears it for a different celebration." -- Rainer Maria Rilke]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["FALLING STARS: Do you remember still the falling stars
that like swift horses through the heavens raced
and suddenly leaped across the hurdles
of our wishes -- do you recall?  And we
did make so many!  For there were countless numbers
of stars: each time we looked above we were
astounded by the swiftness of their daring play,
while in our hearts we felt safe and secure
watching these brilliant bodies disintegrate,
knowing somehow we had survived their fall." -- Rainer Maria Rilke]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I am too alone in the world, and yet not alone enough
to make every moment holy.
I am too tiny in this world, and not tiny enough
just to lie before you like a thing,
shrewd and secretive.
I want my own will, and I want simply to be with my will,
as it goes toward action;
and in those quiet, sometimes hardly moving times,
when something is coming near,
I want to be with those who know secret things
or else alone.
I want to be a mirror for your whole body,
and I never want to be blind, or to be too old
to hold up your heavy and swaying picture.
I want to unfold.
I don’t want to stay folded anywhere,
because where I am folded, there I am a lie.
and I want my grasp of things to be
true before you. I want to describe myself
like a painting that I looked at
closely for a long time,
like a saying that I finally understood,
like the pitcher I use every day,
like the face of my mother,
like a ship
that carried me
through the wildest storm of all." -- Rainer Maria Rilke]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["You who never arrived 
in my arms, Beloved, who were lost 
from the start, 
I don't even know what songs 
would please you. I have given up trying 
to recognize you in the surging wave of 
the next moment. All the immense 
images in me -- the far-off, deeply-felt landscape, 
cities, towers, and bridges, and un-
suspected turns in the path, 
and those powerful lands that were once 
pulsing with the life of the gods-- 
all rise within me to mean 
you, who forever elude me. 

You, Beloved, who are all 
the gardens I have ever gazed at, 
longing. An open window 
in a country house-- , and you almost 
stepped out, pensive, to meet me. Streets that I chanced 
       upon,-- 
you had just walked down them and vanished. 
And sometimes, in a shop, the mirrors 
were still dizzy with your presence and, startled, gave back 
my too-sudden image. Who knows? Perhaps the same 
bird echoed through both of us 
yesterday, separate, in the evening... " -- rainer maria rilke]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["we are continually overflowing toward those who preceded us, toward our origin, and toward those who seemingly come after us. ... It is our task to imprint this temporary, perishable earth into ourselves so deeply, so painfully and passionately, that its essence can rise again “invisibly,” inside us. We are the bees of the invisible. We wildly collect the honey of the visible, to store it in the great golden hive of the invisible." -- Rainer Maria Rilke]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["How I will cherish you then,
      you grief-torn nights!
Had I only received you, 
      inconsolable sisters,
on more abject knees, only 
buried myself with more 
                  abandon           
in your loosened hair. How we waste  
                   our afflictions!
We study them, stare out beyond them
            into bleak continuance, 
hoping to glimpse some end. Whereas 
                    they're really
our wintering foliage, our dark greens
                      of meaning, one
of the seasons of the clandestine
                  year -- ; not only
a season --: they're site, settlement,
               shelter, soil, abode." -- Rainer Maria Rilke]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Harshness vanished. A sudden softness has replaced the meadows' wintry grey. Little rivulets of water changed their singing accents. Tendernesses, hesitantly, reach toward the earth from space, and country lanes are showing these unexpected subtle risings that find expression in the empty trees." -- Rainer Maria Rilke]]>
