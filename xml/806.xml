		<description>
	    <![CDATA["When we isolate decision makers from the rest of the sample, and then compare the impact of the overall sales experience with that of the individual rep selling into the account, what we find is that for decision makers, aspects of the overall sales experience are nearly twice as important as individual rep attributes." -- Matthew Dixon]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["When it does come time to decide, the decision maker wants to know he’s got the strong backing of his team. In other words, the consensus sale isn’t something you should be fighting—it’s something you should be actively pursuing. You can’t just elevate the conversation and cut everyone else out because it’s exactly that team input that the decision maker values most when it comes to loyalty." -- Matthew Dixon]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["What the data tells us is that for non–decision makers, loyalty is much less about discovering needs they already know, and much more about teaching them something they don’t know, for example, something new about how to compete more effectively in their world. Customers will repay you with loyalty when you teach them something they value, not just sell them something they need. Remember, it’s not just the products and services you sell, it’s the insight you deliver as part of the sales interaction itself." -- Matthew Dixon]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Habits are powerful, but delicate. They can emerge outside our consciousness, or can be deliberately designed. They often occur without our permission, but can be reshaped by fiddling with their parts. They shape our lives far more than we realize—they are so strong, in fact, that they cause our brains to cling to them at the exclusion of all else, including common sense." -- Charles Duhigg]]>

	    <![CDATA["But habits emerge without our permission. Studies indicate that families usually don’t intend to eat fast food on a regular basis. What happens is that a once a month pattern slowly becomes once a week, and then twice a week—as the cues and rewards create a habit—until the kids are consuming an unhealthy amount of hamburgers and fries." -- Charles Duhigg]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["When people start habitually exercising, even as infrequently as once a week, they start changing other, unrelated patterns in their lives, often unknowingly. Typically, people who exercise start eating better and becoming more productive at work. They smoke less and show more patience with colleagues and family. They use their credit cards less frequently and say they feel less stressed. It’s not completely clear why. But for many people, exercise is a keystone habit that triggers widespread change." -- Charles Duhigg]]>
