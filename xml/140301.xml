	    <![CDATA["Believing you are worthy of love means that you believe I deserve to be treated well - with respect and dignity.  I deserve to be cherished and adored by someone.  I am worthy of an intimate and fulfilling relationship.  I won't settle for less than I deserve.  I will do whatever it takes to create that for myself." -- Suze Orman]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["There is a vitality, a life force, an energy, a quickening that is translated through you into action, and because there is only one of you in all of time, this expression is unique. And if you block it, it will never exist through any other medium and it will be lost. The world will not have it. It is not your business to determine how good it is nor how valuable nor how it compares with other expressions. It is your business to keep it yours clearly and directly, to keep the channel open. You do not even have to believe in yourself or your work. You have to keep yourself open and aware to the urges that motivate you. Keep the channel open. ... No artist is pleased. [There is] no satisfaction whatever at any time. There is only a queer divine dissatisfaction, a blessed unrest that keeps us marching and makes us more alive than the others" -- Martha Graham]]>
