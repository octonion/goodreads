	    <![CDATA["I believe in love.  And beauty.  I believe that every single person has something they find beautiful and that they truly love.  The smell of their child's hair, the silence of a forest, their lover's crooked grin.  Their country, their religion, their family.  And I believe that if you follow this love all the way to its end, if you start with the thing you find most beautiful and trace it's perfume back to its essence, you will perceive an intangible presence, a swath of stillness that allows the thing you love to be visible like the openness of the sky reveals the presence of the moon." -- Geneen Roth]]>
