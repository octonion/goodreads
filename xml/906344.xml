	    <![CDATA["Book collecting is an obsession, an occupation, a disease, an addiction, a fascination, an absurdity, a fate. It is not a hobby. Those who do it must do it. Those who do not do it, think of it as a cousin of stamp collecting, a sister of the trophy cabinet, bastard of a sound bank account and a weak mind." -- Jeanette Winterson]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The Buddhists say there are 149 ways to God. I'm not looking for God, only for myself, and that is far more complicated. God has had a great deal written about Him; nothing has been written about me. God is bigger, like my mother, easier to find, even in the dark. I could be anywhere, and since I can't describe myself I can't ask for help." -- Jeanette Winterson]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["When my friend Melot set the trap, I think I knew it. I turned to death full face, as I had turned to love with my whole body. I would let death enter me as you had entered me. You had crept along my blood vessels through the wound, and the blood that circulates returns to the heart. You circulated me, you made me blush like a girl in the hoop of your hands. You were in my arteries and my lymph, you were the colour just under my skin, and if I cut myself, it was you I bled. Red Isolde, alive on my fingers, and always the force of blood pushing you back to my heart." -- Jeanette Winterson]]>

	    <![CDATA["There are many forms of love and affection, some people can spend their whole lives together without knowing each other's names. Naming is a difficult and time-consuming process; it concerns essences, and it means power. But on the wild nights who can call you home? Only the one who knows your name." -- Jeanette Winterson]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["  I'm not sayin', I'm just sayin'&quot;-  You use it when you are trying to explain yourself.  For example, if someone was wearing a smelly shirt and you said, &quot;Hey, that's a smelly shirt and they gave you a look, like, hey what are you talking about. Then you could say, &quot;I'm not saying it stinks super bad, like it is hurting my nose, or I can hardly breathe when I stand even kind of close to you, or it might even be an ugly shirt, but my eyes are watering so bad because of the stench that I can't tell if it just smells super bad or if it is ugly too…I'm just saying, you might want to change you shirt before someone else smells it.  To use the quote, you could shorten your reply by saying, &quot;I'm not saying, I'm just saying you might want to change your shirt before someone else smells it.  Just trying to be a friend." -- Jeff Vaughn]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Cooking without remuneration&quot; and &quot;slaving over a hot stove&quot; are activities separated mostly by a frame of mind. The distinction is crucial. Career women in many countries still routinely apply passion to their cooking, heading straight from work to the market to search out the freshest ingredients, feeding their loved ones with aplomb. [...] Full-time homemaking may not be an option for those of us delivered without trust funds into the modern era. But approaching mealtimes as a creative opportunity, rather than a chore, is an option. Required participation from spouse and kids is an element of the equation. An obsession with spotless collars, ironing, and kitchen floors you can eat off of---not so much. We've earned the right to forget about stupefying household busywork. But kitchens where food is cooked and eaten, those were really a good idea. We threw that baby out with the bathwater. It may be advisable to grab her by her slippery foot and haul her back in here before it's too late." -- Barbara Kingsolver]]>
