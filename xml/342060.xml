	    <![CDATA["and when we speak we are afraid
our words will not be heard
nor welcomed
but when we are silent
we are still afraid
So it is better to speak
remembering
we were never meant to survive" -- Audre Lorde]]>

	    <![CDATA["The fact that we are here and that I speak these words is an attempt to break that silence and bridge some of those differences between us, for it is not difference which immobilizes us, but silence.  And there are so many silences to be broken." -- Audre Lorde]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Tell them about how you're never really a whole person if you remain silent, because there's always that one little piece inside you that wants to be spoken out, and if you keep ignoring it, it gets madder and madder and hotter and hotter, and if you don't speak it out one day it will just up and punch you in the mouth from the inside." -- Audre Lorde]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Institutionalized rejection of difference is an absolute necessity in a profit economy which needs outsiders as surplus people.  As members of such an economy, we have &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; been programmed to respond to the human difference between us with fear and loathing and to handle that difference in one of three ways: ignore it, and if that is not possible, copy it if we think it is dominant, or destroy it if we think it is subordinate.  But we have no patterns for relating across our human differences as equals.  As a result, those differences have been misnamed and misused in the service of separation and confusion." -- Audre Lorde]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I have this idea that every time we discover that the names we're being called are somehow keeping us less than free, we need to come up with new names for ourselves, and that the names we give ourselves must no longer reflect a fear of being labeled outsiders, must no longer bind us to a system that would rather see us dead." -- Kate Bornstein]]>
