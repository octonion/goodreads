	    <![CDATA["I believe in the baby Jesus, and I believe he is handsome and lives in the sky with his pet cow.  I believe that it is essential the cow like you, and if you pet the cow with your mind, it will lick your hand and give you cash.  But if you make the cow angry, it will turn away from you, forget you exist, and your life will fall into shambles.  I believe that as long as the cow likes you, you can get what you want.  In order to keep the cow’s favor, you need to ‘let go and let God,’ meaning you can’t obsess about controlling every little thing.  You have to let things unfold naturally, and not try to change things you cannot change.  On the other hand, I believe that if you’ve made the cow happy by living this way, you’re allowed to ask for favors..." -- Augusten Burroughs]]>
