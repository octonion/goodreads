	    <![CDATA["It was all Mrs. Bumble. She &lt;i&gt;would&lt;/i&gt; do it,&quot; urged Mr. Bumble; first looking round, to ascertain that his partner had left the room.

That is no excuse,&quot; returned Mr. Brownlow. &quot;You were present on the occasion of the destruction of these trinkets, and, indeed, are the more guilty of the two, in the eye of the law; for the law supposes that your wife acts under your direction.&quot;

If the law supposes that,&quot; said Mr. Bumble, squeezing his hat emphatically in both hands, &quot;the law is a ass — a idiot. If that's the eye of the law, the law is a bachelor; and the worst I wish the law is, that his eye may be opened by experience — by experience." -- Charles Dickens]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him. How shall we comfort ourselves, the murderers of all murderers? What was holiest and mightiest of all that the world has yet owned has bled to death under our knives: who will wipe this blood off us? What water is there for us to clean ourselves? What festivals of atonement, what sacred games shall we have to invent? Is not the greatness of this deed too great for us? Must we ourselves not become gods simply to appear worthy of it?" -- Friedrich Nietzsche]]>
