		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Journeyâ€™s end

In western lands beneath the Sun
The flowers may rise in Spring,
The trees may bud, the waters run,
The merry finches sing.
Or there maybe 'tis cloudless night,
And swaying branches bear
The Elven-stars as jewels white
Amid their branching hair.

Though here at journey's end I lie
In darkness buried deep,
Beyond all towers strong and high,
Beyond all mountains steep,
Above all shadows rides the Sun
And Stars for ever dwell:
I will not say the Day is done,
Nor bid the Stars farewell.J." -- J.R.R. Tolkien]]>

You keep fitting after you have children or change religions or stop dyeing your hair or quit your job at Goldman Sachs and take up farming. Somehow, God is gracious enough to give us a few of those people, people you can stretch into, people who don't go away, and whom you wouldn't want to go away, even if they offered." -- Lauren F.

But she filled him full, and so he believed everything that had been taken out of him might have been for a purpose.  To clear space for something better. -Cold Mountain" -- Charles Frazier]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Now he reduced his progress to the rhythm of his boots -- he walked across the land until he came to the sea.  Everything that impeded him had to be outweighed, even if only by a fraction, by all that drove him on.  In one pan of the scales, his wound, thirst, the blister, tiredness, the heat, the aching in his feet and legs, the Stukas, the distance, the Channel; in the other, I'll wait for you, and the memory of when she had said it, which he had come to treat like a sacred site.  Also, the fear of capture.  His most sensual memories -- their few minutes in the library, the kiss in Whitehall -- was bleached colorless through overuse.  He knew by heart certain passages from her letters, he had revisited their tussle with the vase by the fountain, he remembered the warmth from her arm at the dinner when the twins went missing.  These memories sustained him, but not so easily.  Too often they reminded him of where he was when he last summoned them.  They lay on the far side of a great divide in time, as significant as B.C. and A.D.  Before prison, before war, before the sight of a corpse became a banality.

But these heresies died when he read her last letter.  He touched his breast pocket.  It was a kind of genuflection.  Still there.  Here was something new on the scales.  That he could be cleared had all the simplicity of love.  Merely tasting the possibility reminded him of how much had narrowed and died.  His taste for life, no less, all the old ambitions and pleasures.  The prospect was of rebirth, a triumphant return." -- Ian McEwan]]>

	    <![CDATA["They took to silence. They touched each other without comment and without progression. A hand on a hand, a clothed arm, resting on an arm. An ankle overlapping an ankle, as they sat on a beach, and not removed. One night they fell asleep, side by side... He slept curled against her back, a dark comma against her pale elegant phrase." -- A.S. Byatt]]>

	    <![CDATA["Perhaps he could still weave together the broken threads of his life.  And yet, I wanted him here now.  I needed him here.  In the darkness, if I sat very still, I could almost feel his presence by me, quite near, but not too near.  Didn't I promise to keep you safe, he would say softly.  I have never broken a promise.  Don't look so worried, Jenny.  And yet, he would be careful.  Careful not to move too close.  Careful not to frighten me.  Waiting still.  I am your shelter.  Don't be afraid." -- Juliet Marillier]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Most true is it that 'beauty is in the eye of the gazer.' My masterâ€™s colourless, olive face, square, massive brow, broad and jetty eyebrows, deep eyes, strong features, firm, grim mouth, â€” all energy, decision, will, â€” were not beautiful, according to rule; but they were more than beautiful to me; they were full of an interest, an influence that quite mastered me, â€” that took my feelings from my own power and fettered them in his. I had not intended to love him; the reader knows I had wrought hard to extirpate from my soul the germs of love there detected; and now, at the first renewed view of him, they spontaneously arrived, green and strong! He made me love him without looking at me." -- Charlotte BrontÃ«]]>

When they done good and made things easy for everybody? Well then, you ain't through learning - because that ain't the time at all. It's when he's at his lowest and can't believe in hisself 'cause the world done whipped him so! when you starts measuring somebody, measure him right, child, measure him right.
