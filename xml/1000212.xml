	    <![CDATA["What you are is a complicated girl with simple needs.  You need your books and time to read, and you need a few friends and you need someone-not to take care of you, but to care for you.  If you have all those things, you'll always be alright." -- Brian Morton]]>

	    <![CDATA["The line of gray along the horizon is brighter now, and with the coming light I feel a certainty: that there is, despite our wild imaginings, only one life. The ghostly others, no matter how real they seem, no matter how badly we need them, are phantoms. The one life we're left with is sufficient to fill and refill our imperfect hearts with joy, and then to shatter them. And it never, ever lets up." -- Richard Russo]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I told him the truth, that I loved him and didn't regret anything about our lives together.  But do we ever 'tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God' as my father used to say, to those we love?  Or even to ourselves?  Don't even the best and most fortunate of lives hint at other possibilities, at a different kind of sweetness and, yes, bitterness too?  Isn't this why we can't help feeling cheated, even when we know we haven't been?" -- Richard Russo]]>
