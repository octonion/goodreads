		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Like flies in amber, like corpses frozen in ice, that which according to the laws of nature should pass away is, by the miracle of ink on paper, preserved.  It is a kind of magic.  As one tends the graves of the dead, so I tend the books.  And every day I open a volume or two, read a few lines or pages, allow the voices of the forgotten dead to resonate inside my head." -- Diane Setterfield]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Good storytelling is one thing rural whites and Indians have in common. But native Americans have learned through harsh necessity that people who survive encroachment by another culture need story to survive. And a storytelling tradition is something Plains people share with both ancient and contemporary monks; we learn our ways of being and reinforce our values by telling tales about each other." -- Kathleen Norris]]>

	    <![CDATA["If you can walk with the crowd and keep your virtue, or walk with Kings-nor lose the common touch; If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you; If all men count with you, but none too much; If you can fill the unforgiving minute with 60 seconds worth of distance run- Yours is the earth and everything that's in it, And-which is more-you'll be a man my son." -- Rudyard Kipling]]>

	    <![CDATA["Stories you read when you're the right age never quite leave you. You may forget who wrote them or what the story was called.
