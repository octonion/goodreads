	    <![CDATA["I think that life is a bit like a biscuit that you only get one bite at.  The best thing is to just go for it.  If you feel an inclination for something, just go for it. Life is too short to muck about doubting yourself.  It's better to try and just shore yourself up with some sort of confidence.  And get on with it!" -- Georgia Byng]]>

	    <![CDATA["There is no one that can share your responsibility.  It it is your responsibility you must carry it on and you must be responsible for your actions.  At the end of the day we all are being challenged, sooner or later, by our destiny.  And it's up to us to make all the difference in this life.  If not you, who else?" -- Garry Kasparov]]>

	    <![CDATA["Figure our what it is you don't do very well, and then don't do it.  I'm not beating myself up about doing everything perfectly.  The litmus test I always use for myself is:  &quot;Okay, if you won 20 million tomorrow in the lottery would you still being doing the same thing you are doing now with your life, Dough?  The answer is &quot;yes&quot;.  I'm always very conscious of that." -- Douglas Coupland]]>
