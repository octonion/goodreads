	    <![CDATA["You know, every year 'Torchwood' has become something a little different than it was before. It's still sci-fi, but it doesn't just deal with spaceships and aliens all the time, because we've done that. Our science fiction is more psychological." -- John Barrowman]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I am who I am firstly because of genetics, and, running a very close second, because of choices: ones my parents made, such as choosing to emigrate to America; ones their parents made, like my Papa Butler opting to ignore medical advice and instead warming my mum in the oven to keep her alive; and very conscious ones that I've made for myself." -- John Barrowman]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Cut! Go again.&quot;
And again, and again, and again. Finally, after the fourth of fifth take I yelled down the hill to the director: &quot;This isn't a fucking marathon! If we're going to go again, tell him on the bloody bike to slow down.&quot;
David turned to me and said, &quot;Having a bit of trouble, Captain?&quot;
&quot;That's all right for you to say,&quot; I laughed breathlessly, &quot;but I'm carrying a rucksack on my back with your fucking hand in a glass jar inside" -- John Barrowman]]>
