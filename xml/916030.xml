	    <![CDATA["How in the hell could a man enjoy being awakened at 8:30 a.m. by an alarm clock, leap out of bed, dress, force-feed, shit, piss, brush teeth and hair, and fight traffic to get to a place where essentially you made lots of money for somebody else and were asked to be grateful for the opportunity to do so? " -- Charles Bukowski]]>

	    <![CDATA["I was a man who thrived on solitude; without it I was like another man without food or water.  Each day without solitude weakened me.  I took no pride in my solitude; but I was dependent on it.  The darkness of the 
room was like sunlight to me." -- Charles Bukowski]]>
