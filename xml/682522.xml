	    <![CDATA["Perhaps there can be too much making of cups of tea, I thought, as I watched Miss Statham filling the heavy teapot.  Did we really need a cup of tea?  I even said as much to Miss Statham and she looked at me with a hurt, almost angry look, 'Do we need tea? she echoed. 'But Miss Lathbury...' She sounded puzzled and distressed and I began to realise that my question had struck at something deep and fundamental.  It was the kind of question that starts a landslide in the mind.  I mumbled something about making a joke and that of course one needed tea always, at every hour of the day or night." -- Barbara Pym]]>
