	    <![CDATA["according to McDowell (1992:407), it is not sufficient that researchers are ‘reflexive’, acknowledging their situatedness in relation to the research project and how, for example, their relative privilege may influence the research process and outcomes.Rather, researchers should actively promote opportunities for the less privileged to undertake research with the privileged" -- Anonymous]]>

	    <![CDATA["Kobayashi asserts that: the question of ‘who speaks for whom?’ cannot be answered upon the slippery slope of what personal attributes – what color, what gender, what sexuality – legitimise our existence, but on the basis of our history of involvement, and on the basis of understanding how difference is constructed and used as a political tool.(" -- Anonymous]]>

	    <![CDATA["Take the example of sugarcane farmers between harvests, a group Mr. Mullainathan and Mr. Shafir followed in subsequent research. He may not have much money in the weeks leading up to harvest time, but he seems to have all the time in the world. Not so. “In a weird way, that’s the biggest false illusion people have,” Mr. Mullainathan says. “Those farmers sitting on the stoop aren’t doing nothing. They’re churning.” The farmers, in other words, aren’t sitting and relaxing. They are sitting and thinking hard about all of their obligations and how they will meet them." -- Anonymous]]>
