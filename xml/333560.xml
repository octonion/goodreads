		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["It is a fundamental truth that the responsibilities of motherhood cannot be successfully delegated.  No, not to day-care centers, not to schools, not to nurseries, not to babysitters.  We become enamored with men’s theories such as the idea of preschool training outside the home for young children.   Not only does this put added pressure on the budget, but it places young children in an environment away from mother’s influence.  Too often the pressure for popularity, on children and teens, places an economic burden on the income of the father, so mother feels she must go to work to satisfy her children’s needs.  That decision can be most shortsighted.  It is mother’s influence during the crucial formative years that forms a child’s basic character.  Home is the place where a child learns faith, feels love, and thereby learns from mother’s loving example to choose righteousness.  How vital are mother’s influence and teaching in the home—and how apparent when neglected!" -- Ezra Taft Benson]]>

We are far too easily pleased." -- C.S. Lewis]]>
