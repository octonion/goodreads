		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Every adult life could be said to be defined by two great love stories.  The first - the story of our quest for sexual love - is well known and well charted, its vagaries form the staple of music and literature, it is socially accepted and celebrated.  The second - the story of our quest for love from the world - is a more secret and shameful tale.  If mentioned, it tends to be in caustic, mocking terms, as something of interest chiefly to envious or deficient souls, or else the drive for status is interpreted in an economic sense alone.  And yet this second love story is no less intense than the first, it is no less complicated, important or universal, and its setbacks are no less painful.  There is heartbreak here too." -- Alain de Botton]]>

It is driven, in other words, by the desire to please and, in that way, is a form of language which has died." -- Adam Nicolson]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["In a secular world, which is what most of us in Europe and North America live in, history takes on the role of showing us good and evil, virtues and vices.  Religion no longer plays as important a part as it once did in setting moral standards and transmitting values. . . .History with a capital H is being called in to fill the void.  It restores a sense not necessarily of a divine being but of something above and beyond human beings.  It is our authority: it can vindicate us and judge us, and damn those who oppose us." -- Margaret MacMillan]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Our basic human institutions - religion, matrimony, and burial, also law, language, literature, and whatever else relies on the transmission of legacy - are authored, always and from the very start, by those who cam before.  The awareness of death that defines human nature is inseparable from - indeed, it arises from, our awareness that we are not self-authored, that we follow in the footsteps of the dead. . . .
Nonhuman species obey the law of vitality, but humanity in its distinctive features is through and through necrocratic.  Whether we are conscious of it or not we do the will of the ancestors; their precedents are our law; we submit to their dictates, even when we rebel against them.  Our diligence, hardihood, rectitude, and heroism, but also our folly, spite, rancor, and pathologies, are so many signatures of the dead on the contracts that seal our identities.  We inherit their obsessions; assume their burdens; carry on their causes; promote their mentalities, ideologies, and very often their superstitions; and often we die trying to vindicate their humiliations.
Why this servitude?  We have no choice.  Only the dead can grant us legitimacy.  Left to ourselves we all bastards." -- Robert Pogue Harrison]]>

	    <![CDATA["He resented such questions as people do who have thought a great deal about them.  The superficial and slipshod have ready answers, but those looking this complex life straight in the eye acquire a wealth of perception so composed of delicately balanced contradictions that they dread, or resent, the call to couch any part of it in a bland generalization.  The vanity (if not outrage) of trying to cage this dance of atoms in a single definition may give the weariness of age with the cry of youth for answers the appearance of boredom." -- Peter De Vries]]>
