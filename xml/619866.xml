	    <![CDATA["When &lt;i&gt;The Journal of Words&lt;/i&gt; compiled its list of the one hundred best novels written in English, do you know that &lt;i&gt;Pride and Prejudice&lt;/i&gt; was number twelve?&quot;  She stopped pacing and glared at Jane.  &quot;And do you know where &lt;i&gt;Jane Eyre&lt;/i&gt; was?&quot; she asked.  She looked at the four of them in turn, but nobody answered her.  &quot;Number fifty-two!&quot; she shrieked.  &quot;Fifty-two! Below that pornographic travesty &lt;i&gt;Lolita&lt;/i&gt;!&quot;  She spat the title as if it were poison.  &quot;Below &lt;i&gt;Huckleberry Finn&lt;/i&gt;! Below &lt;i&gt;Ulysses&lt;/i&gt;. Have you ever tried to read &lt;i&gt;Ulysses&lt;/i&gt;?  Have you ever finished it?  No, you haven't.  No one has.  They just carry it around and lie about having read it." -- Michael Thomas Ford]]>

	    <![CDATA["Her face looked ugly in the attempt to avoid tears; it was an ugliness which bound him to her more than any beauty could have done.  It isn't being happy together, he thought as though it were a fresh discovery, that makes one love--it's being unhappy together." -- Graham Greene]]>
