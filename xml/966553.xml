	    <![CDATA["I like that every page in every book can have a gem on it. It's probably what I love most about writing--that words can be used in a way that's like a child playing in a sandpit, rearranging things, swapping them around. They're the best moments in a day of writing -- when an image appears that you didn't know would be there when you started work in the morning." -- Markus Zusak]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The youthful stationmaster wore a Blue Spot on his uniform and remonstrated with the driver that the train was a minute late, and that he would have to file a report. 

The driver retorted that since there could be no material differene between a train that arrived at a station and a station that arrived at a train, it was equally the staionmaster's fault. 

The stationmaster replied that he could not be blamed, because he had no control over the speed of the station; to which the engine driver replied that the stationmaster could control its &lt;i&gt;placement&lt;/i&gt;, and that if it were only a thousand yards &lt;i&gt;closer&lt;/i&gt; to Vermillion, the problem would be solved. 

To this the stationmaster replied that if the driver didn't accept the lateness as his fault, he would move the station a thousand yards &lt;i&gt;farther&lt;/i&gt; from Vermillion and make him not just late, but &lt;i&gt;demeritably&lt;/i&gt; overdue." -- Jasper Fforde]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power. Words offer the means to meaning, and for those who will listen, the enunciation of truth. And the truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there? Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and oppression. And where once you had the freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and soliciting your submission. How did this happen? Who's to blame? Well certainly there are those more responsible than others, and they will be held accountable, but again truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror. I know why you did it. I know you were afraid. Who wouldn't be? War, terror, disease. There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense.
