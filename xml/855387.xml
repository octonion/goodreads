		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I have learned that if you must leave a place that you have lived in and loved and where all your yesteryears are buried deep, leave it any way except a slow way, leave it the fastest way you can.  Never turn back and never believe that an hour you remember is a better hour because it is dead.  Passed years seem safe ones, vanquished ones, while the future lives in a cloud, formidable from a distance." -- Beryl Markham]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Love was something I would not have to worry about - the whole mystery of love, heartbreak songs, and family legends.  Women who pined, men who went mad, people who forgot who they were and shamed themselves with need, wanting only to be loved by the one they loved.  Love was a mystery.  Love was a calamity.  Love was a curse that had somehow skipped me, which was no doubt why I was so good at multiple-choice tests and memorizing poetry.  Sex was a country I been dragged into as an unwilling girl - sex, and the madness of the body.  For all that it could terrify and confuse me, sex was something I had assimilated.  Sex was a game or a weapon or an addiction.  Sex was familiar.  But love - love was another country." -- Dorothy Allison]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["That's how you get deathless, volchitsa. Walk the same tale over and over, until you wear a groove in the world, until even if you vanished, the tale would keep turning, keep playing, like a phonograph, and you'd have to get up again, even with a bullet through your eye, to play your part and say your lines." -- Catherynne M. Valente]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The gentle reader will never, never know what a consummate ass he can become until he goes abroad. I speak now, of course, in the supposition that the gentle reader has not been abroad, and therefore is not already a consummate ass. If the case be otherwise, I beg his pardon and extend to him the cordial hand of fellowship and call him brother. I shall always delight to meet an ass after my own heart when I have finished my travels." -- Mark Twain]]>

	    <![CDATA["Lebedeva’s eyes shone. “Masha, listen to me. Cosmetics are an extension of the will. Why do you think all men paint themselves when they go to fight? When I paint my eyes to match my soup, it is not because I have nothing better to do than worry over trifles. It says, I belong here, and you will not deny me. When I streak my lips red as foxgloves, I say, Come here, male. I am your mate, and you will not deny me. When I pinch my cheeks and dust them with mother-of-pearl, I say, Death, keep off, I am your enemy, and you will not deny me. I say these things, and the world listens, Masha. Because my magic is as strong as an arm. I am never denied." -- Catherynne M. Valente]]>
