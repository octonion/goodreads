	    <![CDATA["What was on the other side?&quot;
Donna said, &quot;He said there was another world on the other side. He could see it.&quot;
&quot;He... never went through it?&quot;
&quot;That’s why he kicked the shit out of everything in his apartment; he never thought of going through it, he just admired the doorway and then later he couldn’t see it at all and it was too late. It opened for him a few days and then it was closed and gone forever." -- Philip K. Dick]]>
