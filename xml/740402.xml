		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Being a reader is sort of like being president, except reading involves fewer state dinners, usually.

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["And what would happen if we never read the classics?  There comes a point in life, it seems to me, where you have to decide whether you're a Person of Letters or merely someone who loves books, and I'm beginning to see that the book lovers have more fun.  " -- Nick Hornby]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I don't want anyone writing in to point out that I spend too much money on books, many of which I will never read.  I know that already.  I certainly intend to read all of them, more or less.  My intentions are good.  Anyway, it's my money.  And I'll bet you do it too." -- Nick Hornby]]>
