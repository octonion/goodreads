	    <![CDATA["A fight is going on inside me,&quot; said an old man to his son. &quot;It is a terrible fight between two wolves. One wolf is evil. He is anger, envy, sorrow, regret, greed, arrogance, self-pity, guilt, resentment, inferiority, lies, false pride, superiority, and ego. The other wolf is good. he is joy, peace, love, hope, serenity, humility, kindness, benevolence, empathy, generosity, truth, compassion, and faith. The same fight is going on inside you.&quot; 

The son thought about it for a minute and then asked, &quot;Which wolf will win?&quot; 

The old man replied simply, &quot;The one you feed." -- Wendy Mass]]>
