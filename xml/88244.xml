	    <![CDATA["When I began writing The Night Bookmobile, it was a story about a woman's secret life as a reader.  As I worked it also became a story about the claims that books place on their readers, the imbalance between our inner and outer lives, a cautionary tale of the seductions of the written word.  It became a vision of the afterlife as a library, of heaven as a funky old camper filled with everything you've ever read.  What is this heaven?  What is it we desire from the hours, weeks, lifetimes we devote to books?  What would you sacrifice to sit in that comfy chair with perfect light for an afternoon in eternity, reading the perfect book, forever?" -- Audrey Niffenegger]]>

	    <![CDATA["Have you ever found your heart's desire and then lost it?  I had seen myself, a portrait of myself as a reader.  My childhood: days home sick from school reading Nancy Drew, forbidden books read secretively late at night.  Teenage years reading -trying to read- books I'd heard were important, Naked Lunch, and The Fountainhead, Ulysses and Women in Love... It was as though I had dreamt the perfect lover, who vanished as I woke, leaving me pining and surly." -- Audrey Niffenegger]]>
