		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Unlike film, real life rarely provides an opportunity for a retake,&quot; Ben said.  &quot;Perhaps that is why I like film so much.  But I do think we have to give ourselves the same amount of leeway that we give others.  Forgive ourselves.  Have pity on ourselves.  And perhaps even love ourselves a little.&quot; (197)" -- Linda Olsson]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Take risks!  That is really what life is about.  We must pursue our own happiness.  Nobody has ever lived our lives; ther are no guidelines.  Trust your instincts.  Accept nothing but the best.  But then also look for it carefully.  Don't allow it to slip between your fingers.  Sometimes, good things come to us in a such a quiet fashion.  And nothing comes complete.  It is what we make of whatever we encounter that determines the outcome.  What we choose to see, what we choose to save.  And what we choose to remember.  Never foget that all the love in your life is there, inside you, always." -- Linda Olsson]]>
