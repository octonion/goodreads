	    <![CDATA["I don't want you forgetting how different our circumstaces are. If you die, and I live, there's no life for me at all back in District Twelve. You're my whole life.&quot; Peeta says. &quot;I would never be happy again. It's different for you. I'm not saying it wouldn't be hard. But there are other people who'd make your life worth living.&quot;
 
&quot;No one really needs me,&quot; he says, and there's no selfpity in his voice. It's true his family doesn't need him. They will mourn him, as will a handfull of friends. But they will get on.... I realise only one person will be damaged beyond repair if Peeta dies. Me.

&quot;I do,&quot; I say. &quot;I need you." -- Suzanne Collins]]>

	    <![CDATA["Peeta, how come I never know when you're having a nightmare?” I say.

“I don't know. I don't think I cry out or thrash around or anything. I just come to, paralyzed with terror,” he says.

“You should wake me,” I say, thinking about how I can interrupt his sleep two or three times on a bad night. About how long it can take to calm me down.

“It's not necessary. My nightmares are usually about losing you,” he says. “I'm okay once I realize you're here." -- Suzanne Collins]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["At a few minutes before four, Peeta turns to me again. &quot;Your favorite colour . . . it's green?&quot;
   &quot;That's right.&quot; Then I think of something to add. &quot;And yours is orange.&quot;
   &quot;Orange?&quot; He seems unconvinced.
   &quot;Not bright orange. But soft. Like the sunset,&quot; I say. &quot;At least, that's what you told me once.&quot;
   &quot;Oh.&quot; He closes his eyes briefly, maybe trying to conjure up that sunset, then nods his head. &quot;Thank you.&quot;
   But more words tumble out. &quot;You're a painter. You're a baker. You like to sleep with the windows open. You never take sugar in your tea. And you always double-knot your shoelaces.&quot;
   Then I dive into my tent before I do something stupid like cry." -- Suzanne Collins]]>
