	    <![CDATA["Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do." -- Apple Computer Inc.]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I spent my entire life waiting for you, Marianne, and I didn't even know it until you arrived.  Being burned was the best thing that ever happened to me because it brought you.  I wanted to die but you filled me with so much love that it overflowed and I couldn't help but love you back.  It happened before I even knew it and now I can't imagine not loving you.  You have said that it takes so much for me to believe anything, but I &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; believe. I believe in your love for me. I believe in my love for you. I believe that every remaining beat of my heart belongs to you, and I believe that when I finally leave this world, my last breath will carry your name. I believe that my final word--&lt;i&gt;Marianne&lt;/i&gt;--will be all I need to know that my life was good and full and worthy, and I believe that our love will last forever." -- Andrew Davidson]]>
