	    <![CDATA["Am I crazy?&quot; she asked. &quot;I feel like I am sometimes.&quot;
 &quot;Maybe,&quot; he said, rubbing her forehead. &quot;But don't worry about it. You need to be a little bit crazy. Crazy is the price you pay for having an imagination. It's your superpower. Tapping into the dream. It's a good thing not a bad thing." -- Ruth Ozeki]]>

Everything in the universe was constantly changing, and nothing stays the same, and we must understand how quickly time flows by if we are to wake up and truly live our lives. 

That’s what it means to be a time being, old Jiko told me, and then she snapped her crooked fingers again. 

And just like that, you die." -- Ruth Ozeki]]>
