	    <![CDATA["On July 2, McCandless finished reading Tolstoy's &quot;Family Happiness&quot;, having marked several passages that moved him:
&quot;He was right in saying that the only certain happiness in life is to live for others...

I have lived through much, and now I think I have found what is needed for happiness. A quiet secluded life in the country, with the possibility of being useful to people to whom it is easy to do good, and who are not accustomed to have it done to them; then work which one hopes may be of some use; then rest, nature, books , music, love for one's neighbor - such is my idea of happiness. And then, on top of all that, you for a mate, and children, perhaps - what more can the heart of a man desire?&quot; ..." -- Jon Krakauer]]>
