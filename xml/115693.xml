	    <![CDATA["Emotions, in my experience, aren't covered by single words.
I don't believe in &quot;sadness&quot;, &quot;joy&quot;, or &quot;regret&quot;.
Maybe the best proof that the language is patriarchal is that is oversimplifies feeling. I'd like to have at my disposal complicated hybrid emotions." -- Jeffrey Eugenides]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["It was only a smile, nothing more. It didn't make everything all right. It didn't make ANYTHING all right. Only a smile. A tiny thing. A leaf in the woods, shaking in the wake of a startled bird's flight. But I'll take it. With open arms. Because when spring comes, it melts the snow one flake at a time, and maybe I just witnessed the first flake melting. - Amir" -- Khaled Hosseini]]>

	    <![CDATA["Haji Ali taught me the most important lesson I've ever learned in my life...We Americans think you have to accomplish everything quickly. We're the country of thirty-minute power lunches and two-minute football drills. Haji Ali taught me to share three cups of tea, to slow down and make building relationships as important as building projects." -- Greg Mortenson]]>

	    <![CDATA["In times of war, you often hear leaders—Christian, Jewish, and Muslim—saying, ‘God is on our side.’ But that isn’t true. In war, God is on the side of refugees, widows, and orphans." -- Greg Mortenson]]>
