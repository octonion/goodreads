	    <![CDATA["Sometmes when you pull knives on people, they get this impression that you're going to hurt them, and then they're completely terrified.  Crazy, I know!&quot;

&quot;Okay,&quot; said Nick.  He turned to Jamie &amp; popped his left wrist sheath again.  &quot;Look.&quot;

Jamie backed up.  &quot;Which part of 'completely terrified' did you translate as 'show us your knives, Nick'?  Don't show me your knives, Nick.  I have no interest in your knives.&quot;

Nick rolled his eyes.  &quot;This is a quillon dagger.  That's a knife with a sword handle.  I like it because it has a good grip for stabbing.&quot;

&quot;Why do you say these things?&quot; Jamie inquired piteously.  &quot;Is it to make me sad?&quot;

&quot;I didn't have you cornered,&quot; Nick went on.  &quot;You could've run.  And this dagger doesn't have an even weight distribution; it's absolute rubbish for throwing.  If I had any intention of hurting you, I'd have used a knife I could throw.&quot;

Jamie blinked.  &quot;I will remember those words always.  I may try to forget them, but I sense that I won't be able to." -- Sarah Rees Brennan]]>
