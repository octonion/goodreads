		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The stories never said why she was wicked. It was enough to be an old woman, enough to be all alone, enough to look strange because you have no teeth. It was enough to be called a witch. If it came to that, the book never gave you the evidence of anything. It talked about &quot;a handsome prince&quot;... was he really, or was it just because he was a prince that people called handsome? As for &quot;a girl who was as beautiful as the day was long&quot;... well, which day? In midwinter it hardly ever got light! The stories don't want you to think, they just wanted you to believe what you were told..." -- Terry Pratchett]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Something Vimes had learned as a young guard drifted up from memory. If you have to look along the shaft of an arrow from the wrong end, if a man has you entirely at his mercy, then hope like hell that man is an evil man. Because the evil like power, power over people, and they want to see you in fear. They want you to know you're going to die. So they'll talk. They'll gloat.

They'll watch you squirm. They'll put off the moment of murder like another man will put off a good cigar.

So hope like hell your captor is an evil man. A good man will kill you with hardly a word." -- Terry Pratchett]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Dogs are not like cats, who amusingly tolerate humans only until someone comes up with a tin opener that can be operated with a paw. Men made dogs, they took wolves and gave them human things--unnecessary intelligence, names, a desire to belong, and a twitching inferiority complex. All dogs dream wolf dreams, and know they're dreaming of biting their Maker. Every dog knows, deep in his heart, that he is a Bad Dog..." -- Terry Pratchett]]>
