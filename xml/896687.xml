	    <![CDATA["I didn’t know what to do for my project so I brought in a paper cup filled with dirt just hoping that she’d know I’m an idiot and just walk right on past me just as long as I was holding something. 

“What do you have there, Brian?” 

“It’s a cup of dirt. Just put an ‘F’ on it there and let me go home.” 

“Well, explain it.” 

“Well, it’s a cup with dirt in it. I call it ‘Cup of Dirt.’ You should move on now. Just go ahead and move on. Head on down the line there." -- Brian Regan]]>
