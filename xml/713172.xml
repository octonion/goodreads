		<description>
	    <![CDATA["We have forgotten what Thomas Jefferson told us in 1776: that we are endowed by the Creator &quot;with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness.&quot; Not happiness, mind you, but its pursuit.  By implication Jefferson warned that if you pursue happiness for someone else, you deny him the right to pursue it on his own." -- John Rosemond]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Do you remember what Darwin says about music? He claims that the power of producing and appreciating it existed among the human race long before the power of speech was arrived at. Perhaps that is why we are so subtly influenced by it. There are vague memories in our souls of those misty centuries when the world was in its childhood.' 
That's a rather broad idea,' I remarked. 
One's ideas must be as broad as Nature if they are to interpret Nature,' he answered." -- Arthur Conan Doyle]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I have always held, too, that pistol practice should be distinctly an open-air pastime; and when Homes, in one of his queer humours, would sit in an armchair with his hair-trigger and a hundred Boxer cartridges and proceed to adorn the opposite wall with a patriotic V.R. done in bullet pocks, I felt strongly that neither the atmosphere nor the appearance of our room was improved by it." -- Arthur Conan Doyle]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Dr. Watson's summary list of Sherlock Holmes's strengths and weaknesses:

&quot;1. Knowledge of Literature: Nil.
2. Knowledge of Philosophy: Nil.
3. Knowledge of Astronomy: Nil.
4. Knowledge of Politics: Feeble.
5. Knowledge of Botany: Variable.  Well up in belladonna, opium, and poisons generally.  Knows nothing of practical gardening.
6. Knowledge of Geology: Practical but limited.  Tells at a glance different soils from each other.  After walks has shown me splashes upon his trousers, and told me by their colour and consistence in what part of London he had received them.
7. Knowledge of Chemistry: Profound.
8. Knowledge of Anatomy: Accurate but unsystematic.
9. Knowledge of Sensational Literature: Immense.  He appears to know every detail of every horror perpetrated in the century.
10. Plays the violin well.
11. Is an expert singlestick player, boxer, and swordsman.
12. Has a good practical knowledge of British law." -- Arthur Conan Doyle]]>

'I shall be delighted.'
'You don't mind breaking the law?'
'Not in the least.'
'Nor running a chance of arrest?'
'Not in a good cause.'
'Oh, the cause is excellent!'
'Then I am your man.'
'I was sure that I might rely on you." -- Arthur Conan Doyle]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["By a man's finger-nails, by his coat-sleeve, by his boots, by his trouser-knees, by the callosities of his forefinger and thumb, by his expression, by his shirt-cuff â€” By each of these things a man's calling is plainly revealed. That all united should fail to enlighten the competent inquirer in any case is almost inconceivable. You know that a conjurer gets no credit when once he has explained his trick; and if I show you too much of my method of working, you will come to the conclusion that I am a very ordinary individual after all." -- Arthur Conan Doyle]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["There is nothing in which deduction is so necessary as in religion,&quot; said he, leaning with his back against the shutters. &quot;It can be built up as an exact science by the reasoner. Our highest assurance of the goodness of Providence seems to me to rest in the flowers. All other things, our powers, our desires, our food, are all really necessary for our existence in the first instance. But this rose is an extra. Its smell and its colour are an embellishment of life, not a condition of it. It is only goodness which gives extras, and so I say again that we have much to hope from the flowers." -- Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]]>
