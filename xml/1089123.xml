	    <![CDATA["We know it's all just daydreaming.  In all likelihood, no one in this forest'll ever get a javelin, and I'll never see my mother's kingdom again, let alone be hailed by crowds as the jewel of Kildenree.  Maybe it's vain to wish for it. But sometimes, it'd be nice just to hold something real in your hands that felt like a measure of your worth.  Right Finn?" -- Shannon Hale]]>

	    <![CDATA["But in a country where you hang your dead up on walls and pride whether or not a man bears a javelin more than his character, how am I to persuade you out of a war? It would be suicide for Kildenree to war on Bayern and butchery for Bayern to attack Kildenree. If you don't believe me, then send me back.  Or if you don't trust me to leave, I'll return to my little room on the west wall and tend your geese, and you can be sure that on my watch no thieves will touch my flock." -- Shannon Hale]]>

&quot;So seriously,&quot; Doren said. &quot;What's with the puppet?" -- Brandon Mull]]>
