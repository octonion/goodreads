		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Without a revolution of the inner life, however slow, all our big designs are worthless.  The work we have to do is with ourselves if we're ever going to be at peace with each other...the good that flows from it will shape our societies in an unprogrammed, unforeseen way, under the control of no single group of people or set of ideas." -- Ian Mcewan]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The evil I'm talking about lives in us all.  It takes hold in an individual, in private lives, within a family, adn then it's children who suffer most.  And then, when teh conditions are right, in different countries, at different times, a terrible cruelty, a viciousness against life erupts, and everyone is surprised by the depth of hatred within himself.  Then it sinks back and waits.  It's something in our hearts." -- Ian Mcewan]]>

	    <![CDATA["One who really prays that this kingdom will come...[will make the effort to] keep himself in harmony with the order of the kingdom, to subject the flesh to the spirit, selfishness to altruism, and to learn to love the things that God loves.  To make the will of God supreme on earth as it is in heaven is to be allied with God in the affairs of life." -- James Talmage]]>

	    <![CDATA["He's feeling a pull, like gravity, of the approaching TV news. It's a condition of the times, this compulsion to hear how it stands with the world, and be joined to the generality, to a community of anxiety. The habit's grown stronger these past two years; a different scale of news value has been set by monstrous and spectacular scenes. [...] Everyone fears it, but there's also a darker longing in the collective mind, a sickening for self-punishment and a blasphemous curiosity. Just as the hospitals have their crisis plans, so the television networks stand ready to deliver, and their audiences wait. Bigger, grosser next time. Please don't let it happen. But let me see it all the same, as it's happening and from every angle, and let me be among the first to know." -- Ian McEwan]]>
