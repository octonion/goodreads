		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The president of the United States has claimed, on more than one occasion, to be in dialogue with God. If he said that he was talking to God through his hairdryer, this would precipitate a national emergency. I fail to see how the addition of a hairdryer makes the claim more ridiculous or offensive." -- Sam Harris]]>

	    <![CDATA["Oh, the terrible struggle that I have had against sleep so often of late; the pain of the sleeplessness, or the pain of the fear of sleep, and with such unknown horror as it has for me! How blessed are some people, whose lives have no fears, no dreads; to whom sleep is a blessing that comes nightly, and brings nothing but sweet dreams." -- Bram Stoker]]>

You shall possess the good of the earth and sun.... there are millions of suns left,
You shall no longer take things at second or third hand.... nor look through the eyes of the dead.... nor feed on the spectres in books,
You shall not look through my eyes either, nor take things from me,
You shall listen to all sides and filter them from yourself." -- Walt Whitman]]>

	    <![CDATA["So long as there shall exist, by reason of law and custom, a social condemnation which, in the midst of civilization, artificially creates a hell on earth, and complicates with human fatality a destiny that is divine; so long as the three problems of the century - the  degradation of man by the exploitation of his labour, the ruin of women by starvation and the atrophy of childhood by physical and spiritual night are not solved; so long as, in certain regions, social asphyxia shall be possible; in other words and from a still broader point of view, so long as ignorance and misery remain on earth, there should be a need for books such as this." -- Victor Hugo]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["We look for medicine to be an orderly field of knowledge and procedure.  But it is not.  It is an imperfect science, an enterprise of constantly changing knowledge, uncertain information, fallible individuals, and at the same time lives on the line.  There is science in what we do, yes, but also habit, intuition, and sometimes plain old guessing.  The gap between what we know and what we aim for persists.  And this gap complicates everything we do." -- Atul Gawande]]>

	    <![CDATA["Turning and turning in the widening gyre
The falcon cannot hear the falconer;
Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,
The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere
The ceremony of innocence is drowned;
The best lack all conviction, while the worst
Are full of passionate intensity." -- William Butler Yeats]]>

	    <![CDATA["I will arise and go now,
And go to Innisfree,
And a small cabin build there,
Of clay and wattles made;
Nine bean rows will I have there,
A hive for the honey bee,
And live alone in the bee-loud glade.

And I shall have some peace there,
For peace comes dropping slow,
Dropping from the veils of the morning
To where the cricket sings;
There midnight's all a glimmer,
And noon a purple glow,
And evening full of the linnet's wings

I will arise and go now,
For always night and day
I hear lake water lapping
With low sounds by the shore;
While I stand on the roadway
Or on the pavements gray,
I hear it in the deep heart's core." -- William Butler Yeats]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["BELOVED, gaze in thine own heart, 
The holy tree is growing there; 
From joy the holy branches start, 
And all the trembling flowers they bear. 
The changing colours of its fruit 
Have dowered the stars with merry light; 
The surety of its hidden root 
Has planted quiet in the night; 
The shaking of its leafy head 
Has given the waves their melody, 
And made my lips and music wed, 
Murmuring a wizard song for thee. 
There the Loves a circle go, 
The flaming circle of our days, 
Gyring, spiring to and fro 
In those great ignorant leafy ways; 
Remembering all that shaken hair 
And how the wingèd sandals dart, 
Thine eyes grow full of tender care: 
Beloved, gaze in thine own heart. 
  
Gaze no more in the bitter glass 
The demons, with their subtle guile, 
Lift up before us when they pass, 
Or only gaze a little while; 
For there a fatal image grows 
That the stormy night receives, 
Roots half hidden under snows, 
Broken boughs and blackened leaves. 
For all things turn to barrenness 
In the dim glass the demons hold, 
The glass of outer weariness, 
Made when God slept in times of old. 
There, through the broken branches, go 
The ravens of unresting thought; 
Flying, crying, to and fro, 
Cruel claw and hungry throat, 
Or else they stand and sniff the wind, 
And shake their ragged wings; alas! 
Thy tender eyes grow all unkind: 
Gaze no more in the bitter glass.

- The Two Trees" -- William Butler Yeats]]>
