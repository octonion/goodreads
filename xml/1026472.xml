	    <![CDATA["It should be your care, therefore, and mine, to elevate the minds of our children and exalt their courage; to accelerate and animate their industry and activity; to excite in them an habitual contempt of meanness, abhorrence of injustice and inhumanity, and an ambition to excel in every capacity, faculty, and virtue. If we suffer their minds to grovel and creep in infancy, they will grovel all their lives." -- John Adams]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["To believe your own thought, to believe that what is true for you in your private heart, is true for all men—that is genius….Familiar as the voice of the mind is to each, the highest merit we ascribe to Moses, Plato, and Milton, is that they set at naught books and traditions, and spoke not what men, but what they thought. A man should learn to detect and watch that gleam of light which flashes across his mind from within, more that the luster of the firmament of bards and sages. Yet he dismisses without notice his thought because it is his." -- C.S. Lewis]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["One problem with our current society is that we have an attitude towards education as if it is there to simply make you more clever, make you more ingenious... Even though our society does not emphasize this, the most important use of knowledge and education is to help us understand the importance of engaging in more wholesome actions and bringing about discipline within our minds.  The proper utilization of our intelligence and knowledge is to effect changes from within to develop a good heart." -- Dalai Lama]]>
