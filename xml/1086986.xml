		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Though all three men faced the same hardship, their differing perceptions of it appeared to be shaping their fates.  Louie and Phil's hope displaced their fear and inspired them to work toward their survival, and each success renewed their physical and emotional vigor.  Mac's resignation seemed to paralyze him and the less he participated in their efforts to survive, the more he slipped. Though he did the least, as the days passed, it was he who faded the most.  Louie and Phil's optimism, and Mac's hopelessness, were becoming self-fulfilling." -- Laura Hillenbrand]]>

 &quot;Maybe,&quot; he said, rubbing her forehead. &quot;But don't worry about it. You need to be a little bit crazy. Crazy is the price you pay for having an imagination. It's your superpower. Tapping into the dream. It's a good thing not a bad thing." -- Ruth Ozeki]]>
