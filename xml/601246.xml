	    <![CDATA["The person you have known a long tme is embedded in you like a jewel. The person you have just met casts out a few glistening beams &amp; you are fascinated to see more of them.  How many more are there? With someone you've barely met the curiosity is intoxicating." -- Naomi Shihab Nye]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The reason 'closure' is a cliche is that it is used too often, too imprecisely, and doesn't in any case reflect reality.  In reality, such closure in broken friendships and much else in life is rarely achieved; only death brings closure and then not always for those still living." -- Joseph Epstein]]>

	    <![CDATA["God is the highest good of the reasonable creature.  The enjoyment of him is our proper; and is the only happiness with which our souls can be satisfied. To go to heaven, fully to enjoy God, is infinitely better than the most pleasant accommodations here. Better than fathers and mothers, husbands, wives, or children, or the company of any, or all earthly friends.  These are but shadows; but the enjoyment of God is the substance. These are but scattered beams; but God is the sun. These are but streams; but God is the fountain. These are but drops, but God is the ocean." -- Jonathan Edwards]]>
