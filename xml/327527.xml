		<description>
	    <![CDATA["In the world outside this glass room, songbirds are feeding and resting in the trees.  Some will take off tonight and not land until they reach Venezuela.  Sandpipers, plovers, and broad-winged hawks have already left for Patagonia and Panama.  Bats are headed for caves in Kentucky and Tennessee.  Out in the Atlantic, humpback whales pass by on their way to the Caribbean.  Even now, Canada geese are honking toward us from Quebec.  It is a good day for the beginnings of journeys.
Every time I look at you, I think, Now I cannot die." -- Sandra Steingraber]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Be patient toward all that is unsolved in your heart and try to love the questions themselves, like locked rooms and like books that are now written in a very foreign tongue. Do not now seek the answers, which cannot be given you because you would not be able to live them. And the point is, to live everything. Live the questions now. Perhaps you will then gradually, without noticing it, live along some distant day into the answer." -- Rainer Maria Rilke]]>

I try to hold both history and the wilderness in mind, that my poems may approach the true measure of things and stand against the unbalance and ignorance of our times." -- Gary Snyder]]>

	    <![CDATA["You stand there, braced.  Cloud shadows race over the buff rock stacks as a projected film, casting a queasy, mottled ground rash.  The air hisses and it is no local breeze but the great harsh sweep of wind from the turning of the earth.  The wild country--indigo jags of mountain, grassy plain everlasting, tumbled stones like fallen cities, the flaring roll of sky--provokes a spiritual shudder.  It is like a deep note that cannot be heard but is felt, it is like a claw in the gut...
...Other cultures have camped here a while and disappeared.  Only earth and sky matter.  Only the endlessly repeated flood of morning light.  You begin to see that God does not owe us much beyond that." -- Annie Proulx]]>

	    <![CDATA["Every one of us is called upon, perhaps many times, to start a new life.  A frightening diagnosis, a marriage, a move, loss of a job...And onward full-tilt we go, pitched and wrecked and absurdly resolute, driven in spite of everything to make good on a new shore.  To be hopeful, to embrace one possibility after another--that is surely the basic instinct...Crying out: High tide!  Time to move out into the glorious debris.  Time to take this life for what it is." -- Barbara Kingsolver]]>
