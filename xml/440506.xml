	    <![CDATA["Here is my objection to submarines and space travel: not enough windows. What difference does it make if you're in outer space or underwater, or wherever, if you can't feel, or hear, or see or smell it?" -- Karen Joy Fowler]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Women who work with animals hear this all the time:  that their love for animals must arise out of a sublimated child-rearing urge.  Ana's tired of the stereotype.  She likes children just fine, but they're not the standard against which all other accomplishments should be measured.  Caring for animals is worthwhile in and of itself, a vocation that need offer no apologies." -- Ted Chiang]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I don't think of love in terms of relationships.  It happens in terms of seconds, but it goes away like that, too.  I pass a nurse, I love her, it ends when I go around a corner; at a restaurant I see a forlorn man at the table next to me, and I love him, and the conversation pulls me back, and it's ended.  A patient comes in, and she is sick, and I love her, and then she dies, and I never see her again.  This is what I live for.  Don't think that it's sad." -- Patrick Somerville]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["We all love after-the-bomb stories. If we didn't, why would there be so many of them? There's something attractive about all those people being gone, about wandering in a depopulated world, scrounging cans of Campbell's pork and beans, defending one's family from marauders. But some secret part of us thinks it would be good to survive. All those other folks will die. That's what after-the-bomb stories are all about." -- John Varley]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Nobody, anywhere, has any real sense what is actually going on.&quot;  This doesn't seem to get a very good reaction from the crowd - no doubt I'm scowling as I say it, but still.  I continue:  &quot;I don't either, but at least I know I don't.  I'm sorry but you people aren't like me.&quot;  This is me trying to take the edge off.  Being friendly.  &quot;You haven't done the shit I've done." -- Patrick Somerville]]>

	    <![CDATA["At some point on your road you have to turn and start walking back towards yourself. Or the past will pursue you, and bite the nape of your neck, leave you bleeding in the ditch. Better to turn and face it with such weapons as you possess." -- Hilary Mantel]]>

The boy sat small and listening and still. Slowly he shook his head. The old man leaned closer and whispered:
