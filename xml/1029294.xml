	    <![CDATA["There was a clatter as the basilisk fangs cascaded out of Hermione's arms. Running at Ron, she flung them around his neck and kissed him full on the mouth. Ron threw away the fangs and broomstick he was holding and responded with such enthusiasm that he lifted Hermione off her feet. 
&quot;Is this the moment?&quot; Harry asked weakly, and when nothing happened except that Ron and Hermione gripped each other still more firmly and swayed on the spot, he raised his voice. &quot;OI! There's a war going on here!&quot; 
Ron and Hermione broke apart, their arms still around each other. 
&quot;I know, mate,&quot; said Ron, who looked as though he had recently been hit on the back of the head with a Bludger, &quot;so it's now or never, isn't it?&quot; 
&quot;Never mind that, what about the Horcrux?&quot; Harry shouted. &quot;D'you think you could just --- just hold it in, until we've got the diadem?&quot; 
&quot;Yeah --- right --- sorry ---&quot; said Ron, and he and Hermione set about gathering up fangs, both pink in the face." -- J.K. Rowling]]>

	    <![CDATA["So then I thought, I'd like you to have something to remember me by, you know, if you ever meet some veela when you're off doing whatever you're doing.'
I think dating opportunities are going to be pretty thin on the ground, to be honest.'
There's a silver lining I've been looking for,' she whispered, and then she was kissing him as she never kissed him before, and Harry was kissing her back, and it was a blissful oblivion, better than firewhiskey; she was the only real thing in the world, Ginny, the feel of her, one hand on her back, the other in her long sweet-smelling hair..." -- J.K. Rowling]]>
