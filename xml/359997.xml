	    <![CDATA["Hello, babies. Welcome to Earth. It's hot in the summer and cold in the winter. It's round and wet and crowded. At the outside, babies, you've got about a hundred years here. There's only one rule that I know of, babies--: God damn it, you've got to be kind." -- Kurt Vonnegut]]>

	    <![CDATA["You and me,” she says, “we're two sides of the same coin. Gender's a box you turn inside out, tear up, and sew a gown out of.” She says most people are bored and hateful because they can't fuck with the box. They think prison's protection. They take what they're served and think they like it, but deep down they want to be something else, and they'll kill anyone sewing gowns they're afraid to wear." -- Lynn Breedlove]]>
