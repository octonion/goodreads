		<description>
	    <![CDATA["We are here among you as seekers of refuge from our present-your future-a time of worldwide famine, exhausted fuel supplies, terminal poverty-the end of the capitalistic experiment.  Once we came to understand the simpl...truth that earth's resources were limited, in fact soon to run out, the whole capitalistic illusion fell to pieces.  Those of us who spoke this truth were denounced as heretics, as enemies of the prevailing economic faith.  Like religious Dissenters of an earlier day..." -- Thomas Pynchon]]>

	    <![CDATA["Suttree stood among the screaming leaves and called the lightning down.  It cracked and boomed about and he pointed out the darkened heart within him and cried for light.  If there be any art in the weathers of this earth.  Or char these bones to coal.  If you can, if you can. A blackened rag in the rain." -- Cormac McCarthy]]>

	    <![CDATA["All that is gold does not glitter,
Not all those who wander are lost;
The old that is strong does not wither,
Deep roots are not reached by the frost.

From the ashes a fire shall be woken,
A light from the shadows shall spring;
Renewed shall be blade that was broken,
The crownless again shall be king." -- J.R.R. Tolkien]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["She felt the snake between her breasts, felt him there, and loved him there, coiled, the deep tumescent S held rigid, ready to strike. She loved the way the snake looked sewn onto her V-neck letter sweater, his hard diamondback pattern shining in the sun. It was unseasonably hot, almost sixty degrees, for early November in Mystic, Georgia, and she could smell the light musk of her own sweat. She liked the sweat, liked the way it felt, slick as oil, in all the joints of her body, her bones, in the firm sliding muscles, tensed and locked now, ready to spring--to strike--when the band behind her fired up the school song: &quot;Fight On Deadly Rattlers of Old Mystic High.&quot;
