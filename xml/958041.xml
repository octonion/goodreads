	    <![CDATA["Mum says when wanting collides with getting, that's the moment of truth. I want to collide. I want to run right into Shadow and let the force spill our thoughts so we can pick each other up and pass each other back like piles of shiny stones." -- Cath Crowley]]>

	    <![CDATA["I let myself feel good for no reason. I let joy happen right there and then, and it's inside me and around me, it's the lights on the road ahead, the clean black of the night, the cold air coming through the window. It's like hearing a song for the first time and being struck by it, haunted by it, wanting to hunt it down and catch it, because the song sums up something you didn't know you wanted to say, giving you chills and goose bumps. But even as you find out what it's called, and you're thinking you'll download it, you've already lost. Because the feeling was right then and there and it's already fading like a dream.

You just have to see those times for what they are: a chance to look down at your life. And when you do, you see it's a skin made up of shiny little moments." -- Kirsty Eagar]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["It has become something to her, that memory — something she can take out in dismal times and stare into like a crystal ball disclosing not presages but reminders. She holds it in her palm like a captured ladybug and thinks, Well ain’t I been some places, ain’t I partook in some glorious happenings wanderin my way between heaven and earth. And if I ain’t seen everything there is to see, it wasn’t for lack of lookin.
Blind is the real dead." -- Alden Bell]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["In all things we become acclimated; this is our strength in wartime, and also our weakness.  What is a principle, if it alter with circumstance?
But what is a man, if he cannot change to meet changed times? 
And if he can change to meet changed times, is he a man, or several in succession?" -- M.T. Anderson]]>
