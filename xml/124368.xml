		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The only thing worth writing about is people. People. Human beings. Men and women whose individuality must be created, line by line, insight by insight. If you do not do it, the story is a failure. [...] There is no nobler chore in the universe than holding up the mirror of reality and turning it slightly, so we have a new and different perception of the commonplace, the everyday, the 'normal', the obvious. People are reflected in the glass. The fantasy situation into which you thrust them is the mirror itself. And what we are shown should illuminate and alter our perception of the world around us. Failing that, you have failed totally." -- Harlan Ellison]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Of all the systems of religion that ever were invented, there is no more derogatory to the Almighty, more unedifying to man, more repugnant to reason, and more contradictory to itself than this thing called Christianity. Too absurd for belief, too impossible to convince, and too inconsistent for practice, it renders the heart torpid or produces only atheists or fanatics. As an engine of power, it serves the purpose of despotism, and as a means of wealth, the avarice of priests, but so far as respects the good of man in general it leads to nothing here or hereafter." -- Thomas Paine]]>

	    <![CDATA["It is a way now, approximately, of being at home. The forum has become one of the most consistent places of her life, like a familiar cafe that exists someone outside geography and beyond time zones.
    There are perhaps twenty regular posters on F:F:F:, and some muchlarger and uncounted number of lurkers. And right now there are three people in Chat. But there's no way of knowing exactly who until you are in there, and the chat room she finds not so comforting. It's strange even with friends, like sitting in a pitch-dark cellar conversing with people at a distance of about fifteen feet. the hectic speed, and the brevity of the lines in the thread, plus the feeling that everyone is talking at once, at counmter-purposes, deter her." -- William Gibson]]>

George gave him a little grimace.  'Who's that?  Melville?  Or C.S. Forrester?'

	    <![CDATA["Karpo, as always, was dressed in black.  His leather coat was black.  Even his scarf and fur hat were black.  Rostnikov thought that clothes reflected the people who wore them.  Rostnikov himself dressed neatly, conservatively, in old comfortable suits and ties Sarah had bought for him at market stalls.  As for Karpo's choice of black, Rostnikov was not given to simple judgment.  He himself was rather fond of black, which was either the absence of color or the totality of color.  There was a statement in black, he thought.  Black said, You cannot penetrate my being by looking at my exterior.  I am a dark cipher." -- Stuart M. Kaminsky]]>
