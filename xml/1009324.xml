	    <![CDATA["We have everywhere an absence of memory. Architects sometimes talk of building with context and continuity in mind, religious leaders call it tradition, social workers say it’s a sense of community, but it is memory we have banished from our cities. We have speed and power, but no place. Travel, but no destination. Convenience, but no ease." -- Howard Mansfield]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The [commercial] strip is marketed with the come-on of comfort (the Comfort Inn) and with the promise of a home on the road, a home where nobody knows your name and they're glad to see you as long as you can pay. The strip lives in the contradiction of the name Home Depot—domesticity on a gargantuan scale. Home—&quot;a person's native place,&quot; &quot;at ease,&quot; &quot;deep; to the heart,&quot; says the dictionary, and Depot, &quot;a storehouse or a 'warehouse.'&quot; (Warehouse of the Heart?)" -- Howard Mansfield]]>
