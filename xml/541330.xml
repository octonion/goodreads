	    <![CDATA["A muddy little stream, a village grown unfamiliar with time and trees. I turn around and retrace my way up Main Street and park and have a Coke in the confectionery store. It is run by a Greek, as it used to be, but whether the same Greek or another I would not know. He does not recognize me, nor I him. Only the smell of his place is familiar, syrupy with old delights, as if the ghost of my first banana split had come close to breathe on me." -- Wallace Stegner]]>

	    <![CDATA["How these humans dispose themselves! Unlike anything else in creation. Or rather like everything else in creation all at once. Legs of one beast. Arms of another. Proportions all awry to a tortoise's eye.  Torso too squat.  Too little neck.  Vastly too much leg.  Hands like creatures unto themselves.  Senses delicately balanced. And yet each sense dulled by mental acuity. Reason in place of a good nose.  Logic instead of a tail. Faith instead of the certain knowledge of instinct. Superstition instead of a shell." -- Verlyn Klinkenborg]]>
