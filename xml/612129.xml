		<description>
	    <![CDATA["A person does not, as I had imagined, stand motionless and clear before our eyes with his merits, his defects, his plans, his intentions with regard to ourselves (like a garden at which we gaze through a railing with all its borders spread out before us), but is a shadow which we can never penetrate, of which there can be no such thing as direct knowledge, with respect to which we form countless beliefs, based upon words and sometimes actions, neither of which can give us anything but inadequate and as it proves contradictory information â€” a shadow behind which we can alternately imagine with equal justification, that there burns the flame of hatred and of love." -- Marcel Proust]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Every reader, as he reads, is actually the reader of himself.  The writer's work is only a kind of optical instrument he provides the reader so he can discern what he might never have seen in himself without this book.  The reader's recognition in himself of what the book says is the proof of the book's truth." -- Marcel Proust]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Thanks to art, instead of seeing one world only, our own, we see that world multiply itself and we have at our disposal as many worlds as there are original artists, worlds more different one from the other than those which revolve in infinite space, worlds which, centuries after the extinction of the fire from which their light first emanated, whether it is called Rembrandt or Vermeer, send us still each one its special radiance." -- Marcel Proust]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["To achieve accurate knowledge of others, if such a thing were possible, we could only ever arrive at it through the slow and unsure recognition of our own initial optical inaccuracies. However, such knowledge is not possible: for, while our vision of others is being adjusted, they, who are not made of mere brute matter, are also changing; we think we have managed to see them more clearly, but they shift; and when we believe we have them fully in focus, it is merely our older images of them that we have clarified, but which are themselves already out of date." -- Marcel Proust]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The bonds between ourselves and another person exists only in our minds. Memory as it grows fainter loosens them, and notwithstanding the illusion by which we want to be duped and which, out of love, friendship, politeness, deference, duty, we dupe other people, we exist alone. Man is the creature who cannot escape from himself, who knows other people only in himself, and when he asserts the contrary, he is lying." -- Marcel Proust]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["He lived at a little distance from his body, regarding his own acts with doubtful side-glances. He had an odd autobiographical habit which led him to compose in his mind from time to time a short sentence about himself containing a subject in the third person and a verb in the past tense." -- James Joyce]]>
