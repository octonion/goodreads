		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Don't lies eventually lead to the truth?  And don't all my stories, true or false, tend toward the same conclusion?  Don't they all have the same meaning?  So what does it matter whether they are true or false if, in both cases, they are significant of what I have been and what I am?  Sometimes it is easier to see clearly into the liar than into the man who tells the truth.  Truth, like light, blinds.  Falsehood, on the contrary, is a beautiful twilight that enhances every object." -- Albert Camus]]>

	    <![CDATA["I feel, am mad as any writer must in one way be; why not make it real?  I am too close to the bourgeois society of suburbia: too close to people I know I must sever my self from them, or be a part of their world: this half and half compromise is intolerable." -- Sylvia Plath]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["He saw that there was something alive in it, and went near enough to read a sign that said, TWO DEADLY ENEMIES. HAVE A LOOK FREE. There was a black bear about four feet long and very thin, resting on the floor of the cage; his back was spotted with bird lime that had been shot down on him by a small chicken hawk sitting on a perch in the upper part of the same apartment. Mose of the hawk's tail was gone; the bear only had one eye." -- Flannery O'Connor]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I was lingering out on the pavement. There was a missing person inside of myself and I needed to find him . . . I felt done for, an empty burned-out wreck . . . Wherever I am, I'm a '60s troubadour, a folk-rock relic, a wordsmith from bygone days, a fictitious head of state from a place nobody knows." -- Bob Dylan]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["It's quite possible we may actually be looking at some kind of super-sanity here.  A brilliant new modification of human perception, more suited to urban life at the end of the twentieth century...He creates himself each day.  He sees himself as the lord of misrule and the world as a theatre of the absurd." -- Grant Morrison]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["We are the hollow men
We are the stuffed men
Leaning together
Headpiece filled with straw. Alas!
Our dried voices, when
We whisper together
Are quiet and meaningless
As wind in dry grass
Or rats' feet over broken glass
In our dry cellar
Shape without form, shade without colour,
Paralysed force, gesture without motion;

- &lt;i&gt;The Hollow Men&lt;/i&gt;" -- T.S. Eliot]]>
