	    <![CDATA["One of the greatest myths in the world - &amp; the phrase 'greatest myths' is just a fancy way of saying 'big fat lies' -- is that troublesome things get less &amp; less troublesome if you do them more &amp; more. People say this myth when they are teaching children to ride bicycles, for instance, as though falling off a bicycle &amp; skinning your knee is less troublesome the fourteenth time you do it than it is the first time. The truth is that troublesome things tend to remain troublesome no matter how many times you do them, &amp; that you should avoid doing them unless they are absolutely urgent." -- Lemony Snicket]]>
