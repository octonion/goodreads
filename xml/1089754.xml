	    <![CDATA["I mean, d'you know what eternity is? There's this big mountain, see, a mile high, at the end of the universe, and once every thousand years there's this little bird-&quot;

&quot;What little bird?&quot; said Aziraphale suspiciously.

&quot;This little bird I'm talking about. And every thousand years-&quot;

&quot;The same bird every thousand years?&quot;

Crowley hesitated. &quot;Yeah,&quot; he said.

&quot;Bloody ancient bird, then.&quot;

&quot;Okay. And every thousand years this bird flies-&quot;

&quot;-limps-&quot;

&quot;-flies all the way to this mountain and sharpens its beak-&quot;

&quot;Hold on. You can't do that. Between here and the end of the universe there's loads of-&quot; The angel waved a hand expansively, if a little unsteadily. &quot;Loads of buggerall, dear boy.&quot;

&quot;But it gets there anyway,&quot; Crowley persevered.

&quot;How?&quot;

&quot;It doesn't matter!&quot;

&quot;It could use a space ship,&quot; said the angel.

Crowley subsided a bit. &quot;Yeah,&quot; he said. &quot;If you like. Anyway, this bird-&quot;

&quot;Only it is the end of the universe we're talking about,&quot; said Aziraphale. &quot;So it'd have to be one of those space ships where your descendants are the ones who get out at the other end. You have to tell your descendants, you say, When you get to the Mountain, you've got to-&quot; He hesitated. &quot;What have
they got to do?&quot;

&quot;Sharpen its beak on the mountain,&quot; said Crowley. &quot;And then it flies back-&quot;

&quot;-in the space ship-&quot;

&quot;And after a thousand years it goes and does it all again,&quot; said Crowley quickly.

There was a moment of drunken silence.

&quot;Seems a lot of effort just to sharpen a beak,&quot; mused Aziraphale.

&quot;Listen,&quot; said Crowley urgently, &quot;the point is that when the bird has worn the mountain down to nothing, right, then-&quot;

Aziraphale opened his mouth. Crowley just knew he was going to make some point about the relative hardness of birds' beaks and granite mountains, and plunged on quickly.

&quot;-then you still won't have finished watching The Sound of Music.&quot;

Aziraphale froze.

&quot;And you'll enjoy it,&quot; Crowley said relentlessly. &quot;You really will.&quot;

&quot;My dear boy-&quot;

&quot;You won't have a choice.&quot;

&quot;Listen-&quot;

&quot;Heaven has no taste.&quot;

&quot;Now-&quot;

&quot;And not one single sushi restaurant.&quot;

A look of pain crossed the angel's suddenly very serious face." -- Neil Gaiman]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["People think a soul mate is your perfect fit, and that's what everyone wants. But a true soul mate is a mirror, the person who shows you everything that is holding you back, the person who brings you to your own attention so you can change your life.  

A true soul mate is probably the most important person you'll ever meet, because they tear down your walls and smack you awake.  But to live with a soul mate forever?  Nah. Too painful.  Soul mates, they come into your life just to reveal another layer of yourself to you, and then leave.  

A soul mates purpose is to shake you up, tear apart your ego a little bit, show you your obstacles and addictions, break your heart open so new light can get in, make you so desperate and out of control that you have to transform your life, then introduce you to your spiritual master..." -- Elizabeth Gilbert]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Only once in your life, I truly believe, you find someone who can completely turn your world around. You tell them things that you’ve never shared with another soul and they absorb everything you say and actually want to hear more. You share hopes for the future, dreams that will never come true, goals that were never achieved and the many disappointments life has thrown at you. When something wonderful happens, you can’t wait to tell them about it, knowing they will share in your excitement. They are not embarrassed to cry with you when you are hurting or laugh with you when you make a fool of yourself. Never do they hurt your feelings or make you feel like you are not good enough, but rather they build you up and show you the things about yourself that make you special and even beautiful. There is never any pressure, jealousy or competition but only a quiet calmness when they are around. You can be yourself and not worry about what they will think of you because they love you for who you are. The things that seem insignificant to most people such as a note, song or walk become invaluable treasures kept safe in your heart to cherish forever. Memories of your childhood come back and are so clear and vivid it’s like being young again. Colours seem brighter and more brilliant. Laughter seems part of daily life where before it was infrequent or didn’t exist at all. A phone call or two during the day helps to get you through a long day’s work and always brings a smile to your face. In their presence, there’s no need for continuous conversation, but you find you’re quite content in just having them nearby. Things that never interested you before become fascinating because you know they are important to this person who is so special to you. You think of this person on every occasion and in everything you do. Simple things bring them to mind like a pale blue sky, gentle wind or even a storm cloud on the horizon. You open your heart knowing that there’s a chance it may be broken one day and in opening your heart, you experience a love and joy that you never dreamed possible. You find that being vulnerable is the only way to allow your heart to feel true pleasure that’s so real it scares you. You find strength in knowing you have a true friend and possibly a soul mate who will remain loyal to the end. Life seems completely different, exciting and worthwhile. Your only hope and security is in knowing that they are a part of your life." -- Bob Marley]]>

	    <![CDATA["You may not be her first, her last, or her only. She loved before she may love again. But if she loves you now, what else matters? She's not perfect—you aren't either, and the two of you may never be perfect together but if she can make you laugh, cause you to think twice, and admit to being human and making mistakes, hold onto her and give her the most you can. She may not be thinking about you every second of the day, but she will give you a part of her that she knows you can break—her heart. So don't hurt her, don't change her, don't analyze and don't expect more than she can give. Smile when she makes you happy, let her know when she makes you mad, and miss her when she's not there." -- Bob Marley]]>
