		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The human psyche has two great sicknesses: the urge to carry vendetta across generations, and the tendency to fasten group labels on people rather than see them as individuals.  Abrahamic religion mixes explosively with (and gives strong sanction to) both.  Only the willfully blind could fail to implicate the divisive force of religion in most, if not all, of the violent enmities in the world today.  Without a doubt it is the prime aggravator of the Middle East.  Those of us who have for years politely concealed our contempt for the dangerous collective delusion of religion need to stand up and speak out.  Things are different now.  â€˜All is changed, changed utterly." -- Richard Dawkins]]>

	    <![CDATA["If the world were merely seductive, that would be easy. If it were merely challenging, that would be no problem. But I arise in the morning torn between a desire to improve the world and a desire to enjoy the world. This makes it hard to plan the day." -- E.B. White]]>

Believing that personal gain is made by crushing others;
Worrying about things that cannot be changed or corrected;
Insisting that a thing is impossible because we cannot accomplish it;
Refusing to set aside trivial preferences;
Neglecting development and refinement of the mind;
Attempting to compel others to believe and live as we do." -- Marcus Tullius Cicero]]>
