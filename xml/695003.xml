		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Once a musician has enough ability to get into a top music school, the thing that distinguishes one performer from another is how hard he or she works.  That's it. And what's more, the people at the very top don't work just harder or even much harder than everyone else. They work much, much harder." -- Malcolm Gladwell]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The lesson here is very simple.  But it is striking how often it is overlooked.  We are so caught in the myths of the best and the brightest and the self-made that we think outliers spring naturally from the earth.  We look at the young Bill Gates and marvel that our world allowed that thirteen-year-old to become a fabulously successful entrepreneur.  But that's the wrong lesson.  Our world only allowed one thirteen-year-old unlimited access to a time sharing terminal in 1968.  If a million teenagers had been given the same opportunity, how many more Microsofts would we have today?" -- Malcolm Gladwell]]>
