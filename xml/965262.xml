	    <![CDATA["On that very night, the night of the greatest suffering that has ever taken place in the world or that ever will take place, the Savior said, &quot;Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you... Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.&quot; (John 14:27) I submit to you, that may be one of the Savior's commandments that is, even in the hearts of otherwise faithful Latter-day Saints, almost universally disobeyed; and yet I wonder whether our resistance to this invitation could be any more grievous to the Lord's merciful heart." -- Jeffrey R. Holland]]>

	    <![CDATA["The FUTURE of this world has long been DECLARED; the final outcome between GOOD and evil is already KNOWN. There is absolutely no question as to who WINS because the VICTORY has already been posted on the SCOREBOARD. The only really strange thing is all of this is that we are still down here on the FIELD trying to decide which TEAMâ€™S JERSEY we want to wear!" -- Jeffrey R. Holland]]>
