	    <![CDATA["So, like I said, these are a bunch of really sweet guys, but you wouldn't want to share a Galaxy with them, not if they're just gonna keep at it, not if they're not gonna learn to relax a little. I mean it's just gonna be continual nervous time, isn't it, right? Pow, pow, pow, when are they next coming at us? Peaceful coexistence is just right out, right? Get me some water somebody, thank you.&quot;

He sat back and sipped reflectively.

OK,&quot; he said, &quot;hear me, hear me. It's, like, these guys, you know, are entitled to their own view of the Universe. And according to their view, which the Universe forced on them, right, they did right. Sounds crazy, but I think you'll agree. They believe in ...&quot;

He consulted a piece of paper which he found in the back pocket of his Judicial jeans.

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The Jews are a peculiar people: Things permitted to other nations are forbidden to the Jews.
 
Other nations drive out thousands, even millions of people, and there is no refugee problem. Russia did it. Poland and Czechoslovakia did it. Turkey threw out a million Greeks and Algeria a million Frenchmen. Indonesia threw out heaven knows how many Chinese--and no one says a word about refugees.

But in the case of Israel, the displaced Arabs have become eternal refugees. Everyone insists that Israel must take back every single Arab. Arnold Toynbee calls the displacement of the Arabs an atrocity greater than any committed by the Nazis. Other nations when victorious on the battlefield dictate peace terms. But when Israel is victorious it must sue for peace.

Everyone expects the Jews to be the only real Christians in this world." -- Eric Hoffer]]>

   'Are all of these your children?' the woman asked. 'From one wife?'
   'Yes, God has blessed me with all these children,' the rabbi replied.
   'Haven't you heard about the population problem?'the woman sniffed. 'How many more children do you want to have?'
   Rabbi Teller paused and looked the woman in the eye: 'About 6 million,' he said." -- Lynn Vincent]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["JEWS HAVE SIX SENSES
Touch, taste, sight, smell, hearing … memory.  While Gentiles experience and process the world through the traditional senses, and use memory only as a second-order means of interpreting events, for Jews memory is no less primary than the prick of a pin, or its silver glimmer, or the taste of the blood it pulls from the finger.  The Jew is pricked by a pin and remembers other pins.  It is only by tracing the pinprick back to other pinpricks – when his mother tried to fix his sleeve while his arm was still in it, when his grandfather’s fingers fell asleep from stroking his great-grandfather’s damp forehead, when Abraham tested the knife point to be sure Isaac would feel no pain – that the Jew is able to know why it hurts.
When a Jew encounters a pin, he asks:  What does it remember like?" -- Jonathan Safran Foer]]>

But this is predicated upon the person's becoming in every facet an American, and nothing but an American...There can be no divided allegiance here. Any man who says he is an American, but something else also, isn't an American at all. We have room for but one flag, the American flag... We have room for but one language here, and that is the English language... and we have room for but one sole loyalty and that is a loyalty to the American people." -- Theodore Roosevelt  ]]>

	    <![CDATA["Odd, don't you think?  I have seen war, and invasions and riots.  I have heard of massacres and brutalities beyond imagining, and I have kept my faith in the power of civilization to bring men back from the brink.  And yet one women writes a letter, and my whole world falls to pieces.
You see, she is an ordinary woman.  A good one, even.  That's the point ... Nothing [a recognizably bad person does] can surprise or shock me, or worry me.  But she denounced Julia and sent her to her death because she resented her, and because Julia is a Jew.
I thought in this simple contrast between the civilized and the barbaric, but I was wrong.  It is the civilized who are the truly barbaric, and the [Nazi] Germans are merely the supreme expression of it." -- Iain Pears]]>

	    <![CDATA["to be a Jew is to belong to an old harmless race that has lived in every country in the world; and that has enriched every country it has lived in.
&quot;It is to be strong with a strength that has outlived persecutions. It is to be wise against ignorance, honest against piracy, harmless against evil, industrious against idleness, kind against cruelty! It is to belong to a race that has given Europe its religion; its moral law; and much of its science-perhaps even more of its genius-in art, literature and music.
&quot;This is to be a Jew; and you know now what is required of you! You have no country but the world; and you inherit nothing but wisdom and brotherhood. I do not say there are no bad Jews-userers; cowards; corrupt and unjust persons-but such people are also to be found among Christians. I only say to you this is to be a good Jew. Every Jew has this aim brought before him in his youth. He refuses it at his peril; and at his peril he accepts it." -- Phyllis Bottome]]>

	    <![CDATA["Some humans would do anything to see if it was possible to do it. If you put a large switch in some cave somewhere, with a sign on it saying 'End-of-the-World Switch. PLEASE DO NOT TOUCH', the paint wouldn't even have time to dry." -- Terry Pratchett]]>
