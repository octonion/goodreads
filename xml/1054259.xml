	    <![CDATA["According to Adams, Jefferson proposed that he, Adams, do the writing [pf the Declaration of Independence], but that he declined, telling Jefferson he must do it.

Why?&quot; Jefferson asked, as Adams would recount.

Reasons enough,&quot; Adams said.

What can be your reasons?&quot;

Reason first: you are a Virginian and a Virginian ought to appear at the head of this business. Reason second: I am obnoxious, suspected and unpopular. You are very much otherwise. Reason third: You can write ten times better than I can." -- David McCullough]]>
