	    <![CDATA["All women on earth-- and men, too for that matter-- hope for the kind of love that transforms us, raises us up out of the everyday, &amp; gives us the courage to survive our little deaths: the heartache of unfulfilled dreams, of career and personal disappointments, of broken love affairs." -- Lisa See]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I falter where I firmly trod,
    And falling with my weight of cares
    Upon the great world's altar-stairs
    That slope thro' darkness up to God,

    I stretch lame hands of faith, and grope,
    And gather dust and chaff, and call
    To what I feel is Lord of all,
    And faintly trust the larger hope." -- Alfred Lord Tennyson]]>

	    <![CDATA["How lucky Drew was to have this mother of hers, this constant, reliable, if at times irritating presence in her life--this mother, like so many other mothers, beloved and blamed. Lucky she was to have experience, through her mother, the twisted intricaciesof deep, and deeply complex, love." -- Daphne Kalotay]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I used to think mercy meant showing kindness to someone who didn't deserve it, as if only the recipient defined the act. The girl in between has learned that mercy is defined by its giver. Our flaws are obvious, yet we are loved and able t love, if we choose, because there is that bit of the divine still smoldering in us." -- Susan Meissner]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Papa said marriage is not kept by affection but by a pledge. Affection does not beget the pledge; the pledge begets the affection. When you share a life and a home and a bed with someone, you become soul mates as surely as cream and effort produce butter....And so I began to imagine my life with James Luddy. I imagined being butter." -- Susan Meissner]]>
