	    <![CDATA["Ms. Lessing points to a current dogma: political correctness. &quot;It's a continuation of the old Communist Party. It is! The same words, the same attitudes... 'the Communist Party has made a decision and this is the line.&quot; 

At first, she says, political correctness had a good beginning; she remembers saying that the language that we use is sexist, racist and so on. But then, &quot;that became a dogma. Because we love a dogma,you know, we really do. We can never just let things develop easily from an idea, it seems to me there's always a group of fanatics who grasp it and make it a dogma." -- Dorris Lessing]]>

	    <![CDATA["Only yesterday I was no different than them, yet I was saved. I am explaining to you the way of life of a people who say every sort of wicked thing about me because I sacrificed their friendship to gain my own soul. I left the dark paths of their duplicity and turned my eyes toward the light where there is salvation, truth, and justice. They have exiled me now from their society, yet I am content. Mankind only exiles the one whose large spirit rebels against injustice and tyranny. He who does not prefer exile to servility is not free in the true and necessary sense of freedom." -- Kahlil Gibran]]>

	    <![CDATA["Our sadness is an energy we discharge in order to heal. …Sadness is painful. We try to avoid it. Actually discharging sadness releases the energy involved in our emotional pain. 

To hold it in is to freeze the pain within us. The therapeutic slogan is that grieving is the ‘healing feeling.’
