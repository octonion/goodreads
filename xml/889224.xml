	    <![CDATA["Well it seems to me that there are books that tell stories, and then there are books that tell truths...,&quot; I began.
&quot;Go on,&quot; she said
&quot;The first kind, they show you life like you want it to be. With villains getting what they deserve and the hero seeing what a fool he's been and marrying the heroine and happy ending and all that. Like Sense and Sensibility or Persuasion. But the second kind, they show you life more like it is. Like in Huckleberry Finn where Huck's pa is a no-good drunk and Jim suffers so. The first kind makes you cheerful and contented, but the second kind shakes you up.&quot;
&quot;People like happy ending, Mattie. They don't want to be shaken up.&quot;
&quot;I guess not, ma'am. It's just that there are no Captain Wentworths, are there? But there are plenty of Pap Finns. And things go well for Anne Elliot in the end, but they don't go well for most people.&quot; My voice trembled as I spoke, as it did whenever I was angry. &quot;I feel let down sometimes. The people in the books-the heroes- they're always so...heroic. And I try to be, but...&quot;
&quot;...you're not,&quot; Lou said, licking deviled ham off her fingers.
&quot;...no, I'm not. People in books are good and noble and unselfish, and people aren't that way... and I feel, well... hornswoggled sometimes. By Jane Austen and Charles Dickens and Louisa May Alcott. Why do writers make things sugary when life isn't that way?&quot; I asked too loudly. &quot;Why don't they tell the truth? Why don't they tell how a pigpen looks after the sow's eaten her children? Or how it is for a girl when her baby won't come out? Or that cancer has a smell to it? All those books, Miss Wilcox,&quot; I said, pointing at a pile of them,&quot; and I bet not one of them will tell you what cancer smells like. I can, though. It stinks. Like meat gone bad and dirty clothes and bog water all mixed together. Why doesn't anyone tell you that?&quot;
No one spoke for a few seconds. I could hear the clock ticking and the sound of my own breathing. Then Lou quietly said, &quot;Cripes, Mattie. You oughtn't to talk like that.&quot;
I realized then that Miss Wilcox had stopped smiling. Her eyes were fixed om me, and I was certain she'd decided I was morbid and dispiriting like Miss Parrish had said and that I should leave then and there.
&quot;I'm sorry, Miss Wilcox,&quot; I said, looking at the floor. &quot;I don't mean to be coarse. I just... I don't know why I should care what happens to people in a drawing room in London or Paris or anywhere else when no one in those places cares what happens to people in Eagle Bay.&quot;
Miss Wilcox's eyes were still fixed on me, only now they were shiny. Like they were the day I got my letter from Barnard. &quot;Make them care, Mattie,&quot; she said softly. &quot;And don't you ever be sorry." -- Jennifer Donnelly]]>
