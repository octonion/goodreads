		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Most of my friends like words too well. They set them under the blinding light of the poem and try to extract every possible connotation from each of them, every temporary pun, every direct or indirect connection - as if a word could become an object by mere addition of consequences. Others pick up words from the streets, from their bars, from their offices and display them proudly in their poems as if they were shouting, &quot;See what I have collected from the American language. Look at my butterflies, my stamps, my old shoes!&quot; What does one do with all this crap?" -- Jack Spicer]]>
