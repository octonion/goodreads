	    <![CDATA["&lt;i&gt;Boys will be boys&lt;/i&gt;, that's what people say.  No one ever mentions how girls have to be something other than themselves altogether.  We are to stifle the same feelings that boys are encouraged to display.  We are to use gossip as a means of policing ourselves -- this way those who do succumb to sex but are not damaged by it are damaged instead by peer malice.  Girls demand a covenant because if one gives in, others will be expected to do the same.  We are to remain united in cruelty, ignorance, and aversion.  Or we are to starve the flesh from our bones, penalizing the body for its nature, castigating ourselves for advances we are powerless to prevent.  We are to make false promises then resist the attentions solicited.  Basically we are to become expert liars.  (p. 65)" -- Hilary Thayer Hamann]]>
