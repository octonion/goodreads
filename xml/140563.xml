	    <![CDATA["There are infinite numbers between 0 and 1. There's .1 and .12 and .112 and an infinite collection of others. Of course, there is a bigger infinite set of numbers between 0 and 2, or between 0 and a million. Some infinities are bigger than other infinities. A writer we used to like taught us that. There are days, many of them, when I resent the size of my unbounded set. I want more numbers than I'm likely to get, and God, I want more numbers for Augustus Waters than he got. But, Gus, my love, I cannot tell you how thankful I am for our little infinity. I wouldn't trade it for the world. You gave me a forever within the numbered days, and I'm grateful." -- John Green]]>

	    <![CDATA["Some people don't understand the promises they're making when they make them,&quot; I said.

&quot;Right, of course. But you keep the promise anyway. That's what love is. Love is keeping the promise anyway." -- John Green]]>
