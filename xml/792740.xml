	    <![CDATA["I wasted time, and now doth time waste me; 
For now hath time made me his numbering clock: 
My thoughts are minutes; and with sighs they jar 
Their watches on unto mine eyes, the outward watch, 
Whereto my finger, like a dial's point, 
Is pointing still, in cleansing them from tears. 
Now sir, the sound that tells what hour it is 
Are clamorous groans, which strike upon my heart, 
Which is the bell: so sighs and tears and groans 
Show minutes, times, and hours." -- william shakespeare]]>
