	    <![CDATA["She was very near hating him now; yet the sound of his voice, the way the light fell on his thin, dark hair, the way he sat and moved and wore his clothesâ€”she was conscious that even these trivial things were inwoven with her deepest life." -- Edith Wharton]]>

	    <![CDATA["Yet nothing can to nothing fall,
Nor any place be empty quite;
Therefore I think my breast hath all
Those pieces still, though they be not unite;
And now, as broken glasses show
A hundred lesser faces, so
My rags of heart can like, wish, and adore,
But after one such love, can love no more." -- John Donne]]>
