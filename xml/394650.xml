	    <![CDATA["I don't believe in failure, because simply by saying you've failed, you've admitted you attempted.  And anyone who attempts is not a failure.  Those who truly fail in my eyes are the ones who never try at all.  The ones who sit on the couch and whine and moan and wait for the world to change for them." -- Sarah Dessen]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The true secret in being a hero lies in knowing the order of things. The swineherd cannot already be wed to the princess when he embarks on his adventures, nor can the boy knock on the witch's door when she is already away on vacation. The wicked uncle cannot be found out and foiled before he does something wicked. Things must happen when it is time for them to happen. Quests may not simply be abandoned; prophecies may not be left to rot like unpicked fruit; unicorns may go unrescued for a very long time, but not forever. The happy ending cannot come in the middle of the story." -- Peter S. Beagle]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["A man of my acquaintance once wrote a poem called &quot;The Road Less Traveled&quot;, describing a journey he took through the woods along a path most travelers never used. The poet found that the road less traveled was peaceful but quite lonely, and he was probably a bit nervous as he went along, because if anything happened on the road less traveled, the other travelers would be on the road more frequently traveled and so couldn't hear him as he cried for help. Sure enough, that poet is dead." -- Lemony Snicket]]>
