	    <![CDATA["May the blind see the forms,
May the deaf hear sounds.

May the naked find clothing,
The hungry find food;
May the thirsty find water
And delicious drinks.

May the poor find wealth,
Those weak with sorrow find joy;
May the forlorn find new hope,
Constant happiness and prosperity.

May the frightened cease to be afraid
And those bound be freed;
May the powerless find power,
And may the people think of benefiting one another" -- Shantideva]]>

	    <![CDATA["The ancient books are everything I want;
their wisdom is the balm that soothes my pain.
With them I keep sweet company,
my own true circle, and my trusty friends.
They are my sea of wisdom, where I plunge
and bring up pearls to ornament the throat of time.
My heart and eyes get true delight from them,
and to them in return my lips give hymns,
Incense, sweetness, light, and song
to breath and tongue, to ear and eye;
they elevate me, give me pride;
my thoughts are all of them until I die" -- Moses Ibn Ezra]]>

	    <![CDATA["They say, that when I was born,
my mother taught me to suck the milk.
And every night beside my crib,
she taught me to sleep as soft as silk.
With a smile she pressed her lips to mine,
till my mouth with joy oversplit.
She took my hand and guided my foot,
till I learned to walk with a happy lilt.
One word, two words, then three and more...
that's how she taught me to talk.
That's why my life is part of her life,
and will remain so as long as I live" -- Iraj Mirza Persian Poet]]>
