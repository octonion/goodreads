	    <![CDATA["  I think of the chimp, the one with the talking hands.
  In the course of the experiment, that chimp had a baby.  Imagine how her trainers must have thrilled when the mother, without prompting, began to sign her newborn.
  Baby, drink milk.
  Baby, play ball.
  And when the baby died, the mother stood over the body, her wrinkled hands moving with animal grace, forming again and again the words:  Baby, come hug, Baby come hug, fluent now in the language of grief." -- Amy Hempel]]>

	    <![CDATA["Every single one of us is a little civilization built on the ruins of any number of preceding civilizations, but with our own variant notions of what is beautiful and what is acceptable - which, I haste to add, we generally do not satisfy and by which we struggle to live." -- Marilynne Robinson]]>
