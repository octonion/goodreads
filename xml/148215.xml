	    <![CDATA["When crisis comes and you question, “Why me, God? You don’t care for me. You are against me. You have forsaken me,” then love is not perfected. When crisis comes and you can say, “I don’t know why, but God is not surprised. He is with me despite this. He will not forsake me. God is preparing a test so I can have a testimony,” then your love relationship has been perfected in the knowledge of your Father." -- Perry Stone]]>

	    <![CDATA["Scriptures He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty (Psalm 91:1). And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for thou, Lord, hast not forsaken them that seek thee (Psalm 9:10). A thousand may fall at your side, ten thousand at your right hand, but it will not come near you (Psalm 91:7 NIV)." -- Keith Provance]]>
