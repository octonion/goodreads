	    <![CDATA["For Attractive lips, speak words of kindness.
&amp;emsp;For lovely eyes, seek out the good in people.
&amp;emsp;For a slim figure, share your food with the hungry.
&amp;emsp;For beautiful hair, let a child run their fingers through it once a day.
&amp;emsp;For poise, walk with the knowledge that you never walk alone. 
&amp;emsp;People, more than things, have to be restored, renewed, revived, reclaimed, and redeemed. Remember, if you ever need a helping hand, you will find one at the end of each of your arms.
&amp;emsp;As you grow older, you will discover that you have two hands, one for helping yourself and the other for helping others." -- Sam Levenson]]>

	    <![CDATA["I believe in pink. I believe that laughing is the best calorie burner. I believe in kissing, kissing a lot. I believe in being strong when everything seems to be going wrong. I believe that happy girls are the prettiest girls. I believe that tomorrow is another day and I believe in miracles." -- Audrey Hepburn]]>
