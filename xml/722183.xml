	    <![CDATA["When I was a child, adults would tell me not to make things up, warning me of what would happen if I did. As far as I can tell so far, it seems to involve lots of foreign travel and not having to get up too early in the morning." -- Neil Gaiman]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I believe that imagination is stronger than knowledge. That myth is more potent than history. That dreams are more powerful than facts. That hope always triumphs over experience. That laughter is the only cure for grief. And I believe that love is stronger than death." -- Robert Fulghum]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Books can be possessive, can't they? You're walking around in a bookstore and a certain one will jump out at you, like it had moved there on its own, just to get your attention. Sometimes what's inside will change your life, but sometimes you don't even have to read it. Sometimes it's a comfort just to have a book around.  Many of these books haven't even had their spines cracked.  'Why do you buy books you don't even read?' our daughter asks us.  That's like asking someone who lives alone why they bought a cat.  For company, of course." -- Sarah Addison Allen]]>
