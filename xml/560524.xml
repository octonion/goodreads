	    <![CDATA["He tries again, swallowing hard to ease away the painful lump in his throat. &quot;It's just important. I love you. I'm yours. I need people to &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt;.&quot;

&quot;Alright,&quot; Lindsay says suddenly. He leans down to grab at Pip's bag, throwing stuff out onto the carpet, his iPod and phone and wallet and gloves and Attitude magazine until he finds what he's looking for, a green marker pen, and holds it between his teeth while he starts tugging at the hem of Pip's t-shirt. Pip's too surprised to do anything but submit, he lets Lindsay peel off his t-shirt and throw that on top of all the things from his bag then just watches as Lindsay pulls the pen out of the cap in his mouth and signs his name in big green letters on the side of Pip's stomach. He holds his breath, trying not to suck in the belly fat everybody else keeps telling him is imaginary. &quot;There, you're mine, are you fucking happy now?&quot; Lindsay snaps, and throws the recapped pen across the room to get lost in the bookcase somewhere." -- Richard Rider]]>

	    <![CDATA["I knew you were all smitten and shit, but fuck, you really do love this guy.&quot; The smirk in Darren's voice was obvious. And annoying. &quot;Aw, come on, admit it - you feel like Cinderella, don't you?&quot; 
&quot;No, Darren, I don't. And do you know why?&quot;
&quot;No sugar, tell me why.&quot;
&quot;Because I'm a man. I've got a big fat one and I like to fuck other guys.&quot; Darren was laughing over the phone now, and it made Reece grin. &quot;And Ben isn't a prince, he's a cop. A big, sexy cop who fucks like a machine. He's a man. I'm a man. We're men.&quot; He nodded sharply. &quot;Now fuck off. I'm arranging flowers." -- L.A. Gilbert]]>

	    <![CDATA["Now wait a second...&quot; Kenneth butted in.
&quot;Yeah, we haven't asked you the questions yet,&quot; Brandon finished for Kenneth.
&quot;Yeah, like what are your intentions toward our little Ryan,&quot; Patrick added, smirking.
&quot;What do you do for a living?&quot; Brandon added.
&quot;Can you support Ryan's shoe fetish?&quot; Kenneth threw his question in too.
&quot;Hmm, okay, here are my answers.  I plan on feeding him, dancing with him and God willing fucking him until he can't walk straight. I help infertile chickens have baby chickens, and I think so.  I'm hoping his feet are about my size. We can share shoes and everything,&quot; Phillip answered." -- Crystal Rose]]>
