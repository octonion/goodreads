		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Books are living things and their task lies in their vows of silence. You touch them as they quiver with a divine pleasure. You read them and they fall asleep to happy dreams for the next 10 years. If you do them the favor of understanding them, of taking in their portions of grief and wisdom, then they settle down in contented residence in your heart." -- Pat Conroy]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Here's what I love: when a great writer turns me into a Jew from Chicago, a lesbian out of South Carolina, or a black woman moving into a subway entrance in Harlem. Turn me into something else, writers of the world. Make me Muslim, heretic, hermaphrodite. Put me into a crusader's armor, a cardinal's vestments. Let me feel the pygmy's heartbeat, the queen's breast, the torturer's pleasure, the Nile's taste, or the nomad's thirst. Tell me everything that I must know. Hold nothing back." -- Pat Conroy]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I believe the universe wants to be noticed. I think the universe is inprobably biased toward the consciousness, that it rewards intelligence in part because the universe enjoys its elegance being observed. And who am I, living in the middle of history, to tell the universe that it-or my observation of it-is temporary?" -- John Green]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Sometimes, you read a book and it fills you with this weird evangelical zeal, and you become convinced that the shattered world will never be put back together unless and until all living humans read the book. And then there are books like An Imperial Affliction, which you can't tell people about, books so special and rare and yours that advertising your affection feels like betrayal" -- John Green]]>

&quot;Someone should tell Jesus,&quot; I said. &quot;I mean, it's gotta be dangerous, storing children with cancer in your heart.&quot;
&quot;I would tell Him myself,&quot; Augustus said, &quot;but unfortunately I am literally stuck inside of His heart, so He won't be able to hear me." -- John Green]]>
