	    <![CDATA["But even more than her diary, Shimamura was surprised at her statement that she had carefully cataloged every novel and short story she had read since she was fifteen or sixteen. The record already filled ten notebooks.
&quot;You write down your criticisms, do you?&quot;
&quot;I could never do anything like that. I just write down the author and the characters and how they are related to each other. That is about all.&quot;
&quot;But what good does it do?&quot;
&quot;None at all.&quot;
&quot;A waste of effort.&quot;
&quot;A complete waste of effort,&quot; she answered brightly, as though the admission meant little to her. She gazed solemnly at Shimamura, however.
A complete waste of effort. For some reason Shimamura wanted to stress the point. But, drawn to her at that moment, he felt a quiet like the voice of the rain flow over him. He knew well enough that for her it was in fact no waste of effort, but somehow the final determination that it was had the effect of distilling and purifying the woman's existence." -- Yasunari Kawabata]]>

And the end of all our exploring
Will be to arrive where we started
And know the place for the first time." -- T. S. Eliot]]>
