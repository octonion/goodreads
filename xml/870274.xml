		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The disgraced Usurer Yankel D took the baby girl home that evening...  He made a bed of crumpled newspaper in a deep baking pan and gently tucked it in the oven, so that she wouldn't be disturbed by the noise of the small falls outside...  When he pulled her out to feed her or just hold her, her body was tattooed with the newsprint...  Sometimes he would rock her to sleep in his arms, and read her left to right, and know everything he needed to know about the world.  If it wasn't written on her, it wasn't important to him." -- Jonathan Safran Foer]]>
