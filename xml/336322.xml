	    <![CDATA["2. WHAT I AM NOT

My brother and I used to play a game. I'd point to a chair. &quot;THIS IS NOT A CHAIR,&quot; I'd say. Bird would point to the table. &quot;THIS IS NOT A TABLE.&quot; &quot;THIS IS NOT A WALL,&quot; I'd say. &quot;THAT IS NOT A CEILING.&quot; We'd go on like that. &quot;IT IS NOT RAINING OUT.&quot; &quot;MY SHOE IS NOT UNTIED!&quot; Bird would yell. I'd point to my elbow. &quot;THIS IS NOT A SCRAPE.&quot; Bird would lift his knee. &quot;THIS IS ALSO NOT A SCRAPE!&quot; &quot;THAT IS NOT A KETTLE!&quot; &quot;NOT A CUP!&quot; &quot;NOT A SPOON!&quot; &quot;NOT DIRTY DISHES!&quot; We denied whole rooms, years, weathers. Once, at the peak of our shouting, Bird took a deep breath. At the top of his lungs, he shrieked: &quot;I! HAVE NOT! BEEN! UNHAPPY! MY WHOLE! LIFE!&quot; &quot;But you're only seven,&quot; I said." -- Nicole Krauss]]>
