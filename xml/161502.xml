	    <![CDATA["He continued on, on to the glacier, towards the dawn, from ridge to ridge, in deep, new-fallen snow, paying no heed to the storms that might pursue him. As a child he had stood by the seashore at Ljósavík and watched the waves soughing in and out, but now he was heading away from the sea. &quot;Think of me when you are in glorious sunshine.&quot; Soon the sun of the day of resurrection will shine on the bright paths where she awaits her poet.
And beauty shall reign alone." -- Halldór Laxness]]>
