		<description>
	    <![CDATA["You begin to forget what it means to live. You forget things. You forget that you used to feel all right. You forget what it means to feel all right because you feel like shit all the time, and you can't remember what it was like before. People take the feeling of full for granted. They take for granted the feeling of steadiness, of hands that do not shake, heads that do not ache, throats not raw with bile and small rips of fingernails forced to haste to the gag spot. Stomachs that do not begin to wake up in the night, calves and thighs knotting in muscles that are beginning to eat away at themselves. they may or may not be awakened at night by their own inexplicable sobs." -- Marya Hornbacher]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I wanted to kill the me underneath. That fact haunted my days and nights. When you realize you hate yourself so much, when you realize that you cannot stand who you are, and this deep spite has been the motivation behind your behavior for many years, your brain can’t quite deal with it. It will try very hard to avoid that realization; it will try, in a last-ditch effort to keep your remaining parts alive, to remake the rest of you. This is, I believe, different from the suicidal wish of those who are in so much pain that death feels like relief, different from the suicide I would later attempt, trying to escape that pain. This is a wish to murder yourself; the connotation of kill is too mild. This is a belief that you deserve slow torture, violent death." -- Marya Hornbacher]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["It is not a sudden leap from sick to well. It is a slow, strange meander from sick to mostly well. The misconception that eating disorders are a medical disease in the traditional sense is not helpful here. There is no 'cure'. A pill will not fix it, though it may help. Ditto therapy, ditto food, ditto endless support from family and friends. You fix it yourself. It is the hardest thing that I have ever done, and I found myself stronger for doing it. Much stronger." -- Marya Hornbacher]]>

See? you get to say. I knew you'd give up on me. I knew you'd leave." -- Marya Hornbacher]]>

	    <![CDATA["I wish I could find words to explain what this kind of cold is like – the cold that has somehow gotten in underneath your skin and is getting colder and colder inside you. It isn´t an outside sort of cold; it´s a cold that gets into your bones and into your blood and it feels like your heart itself is beating out the cold in hard bursts through your entire body, and you suddenly remember that you have a body because you can´t ignore it anymore. You feel like an ice cube. You feel like you´re naked and have fallen through thin ice on a lake and are drowning in the ice water underneath. You can´t breathe." -- Marya Hornbacher]]>

	    <![CDATA["Uncle Joe used to spend a fair amount of time in the loony bin.  My family wasn't bothered by his regular trips to and from 'the facility'--they'd shrug and say, &lt;i&gt;There goes Joe&lt;/i&gt;, and they'd put him in the car and take him in.  One day Uncle Frank...was driving Uncle Joe to the crazy place.  When they got there, Joe asked Frank to drop him off at the door while Frank went and parked the car.  Frank didn't think much of it, and dropped him off.

Joe went inside, smiled at the nurse, and said, 'Hi.  I'm Frank Hornbacher.  I'm here to drop off Joe.  He likes to park the car, so I let him do that.  He'll be right in.'  The nurses nodded knowingly.  The real Frank walked in.  The nurse took his arm and guided him away, murmuring the way nurses always do, while Frank hollered in protest, insisting that he was Frank, not Joe.  Joe, quite pleased with himself, gave Frank a wave and left." -- Marya Hornbacher]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["At first it's bliss. It's drunken, heady, intoxicating. It swallows the people we were - not particuarly wonderful people, but people who did our best, more or less - and spits out the monsters we are becoming.
Our friends despise us. We are an epic. Everything is grand, crashing, brilliant, blinding. It's the Golden Age of Hollywood, and we are a legend in our own minds, and no one outside can fail to see that we are headed for hell, and we won't listen, we say they don't understand, we pour more wine, go to the parties, we sparkle, fly all over the country, we're on an adventure, unstoppable, we've found each other and we race through our days like Mr. Toad in his yellow motorcar, with no idea where the brakes are and to hell with it anyway, we are on fire, drunk with something we call love." -- Marya Hornbacher]]>
