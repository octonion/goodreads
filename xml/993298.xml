Beg often our own harms, which the wise powers
Deny us for our good; so find we profit
By losing of our prayers." -- William Shakespeare]]>

	    <![CDATA["I’ve met God across his long walnut desk with his diplomas hanging on the wall behind him, and God asks me, “Why?”
Why did I cause so much pain?
Didn’t I realize that each of us is a sacred, unique snowflake of special unique specialness?
Can’t I see how we’re all manifestations of love?
I look at God behind his desk, taking notes on a pad, but God’s got this all wrong.
We are not special.
We are not crap or trash, either.
We just are.
We just are, and what happens just happens.
And God says, “No, that’s not right.”
Yeah. Well. Whatever. You can’t teach God anything." -- Chuck Palahniuk]]>

	    <![CDATA["Maybe that's it, [...] [w]ith what you were talking about before. The world being broken. Maybe it isn't that we're supposed to find the pieces and put them back together. Maybe &lt;i&gt;we're&lt;/i&gt; the pieces.&quot; [...] &quot;Maybe [...] what we're supposed to do is come together. That's how we stop the breaking." -- David Levithan]]>
