	    <![CDATA["It’s too bad your not being able to come,’ said David Windfall to his wife, slipping a couple of condoms into the inside pocket of his dinner jacket, just in case. ‘Have fun, darling,’ gasped Jane, longing for him to leave. ‘It won’t be fun without you,’ said David, wondering whether two condoms were enough. ‘Don’t be silly, darling, you’ll forget about me on the motorway.’ David couldn’t be bothered to contradict the truth of this assertion. ‘I hope you feel better tomorrow,’ he said instead. ‘I’ll call you first thing.’ ‘You’re an angel,’ said his wife. ‘Drive carefully." -- Anonymous]]>

	    <![CDATA["To Giovanni da Pistoia Michelangelo, translated from the Italian by Joel Agee | 144 words (On painting the vault of the Sistine Chapel) 1509 I’ve grown a goiter from this trap I’m in, as cats do from foul water in Lombardy, or some such place, wherever it may be. My stomach’s almost up against my chin, My beard points skyward, at my nape the store of memory dangles, I’ve grown a harpy’s breast, and from above, my dripping brush, for jest, transforms my face into a mosaic floor. And while my haunches press into my gut, my ass serves as a steady counterweight. My feet tread blindly somewhere down below. In front I feel my skin stretched lengthwise, but in back it crimps and folds. This is my state: arched and indented like a Syrian bow. Not to be trusted, though, are the strange thoughts that through my mind now run, for who can shoot straight through a crooked gun? My painting’s dead. I’m done. Giovanni, friend, remove my honor’s taint, I’m not in a good place, I cannot paint." -- Anonymous]]>
