		<description>
	    <![CDATA["When we honestly ask ourselves which person in our lives mean the most to us, we often find that it is those who, instead of giving advice, solutions, or cures, have chosen rather to share our pain and touch our wounds with a warm and tender hand. The friend who can be silent with us in a moment of despair or confusion, who can stay with us in an hour of grief and bereavement, who can tolerate not knowing, not curing, not healing and face with us the reality of our powerlessness, that is a friend who cares." -- Henri Nouwen]]>

	    <![CDATA["You can go through life and make new friends every year - every month practically - but there was never any substitute for those friendships of childhood that survive into adult years. Those are the ones in which we are bound to one another with hoops of steel." -- Alexander McCall Smith]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["This is how it works.  I love the people in my life, and I do for my friends whatever they need me to do for them, again and again, as many times as is necessary.  For example, in your case you always forgot who you are and how much you're loved.  So what I do for you as your friend is remind you who you are and tell you how much I love you.  And this isn't any kind of burden for me, because I love who you are very much.  Every time I remind you, I get to remember with you, which is my pleasure." -- James Lecesne]]>
