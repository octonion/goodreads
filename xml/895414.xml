	    <![CDATA["Why couldn't the merciful God turn down the sunlight so it wasn't blasting like a red furnace against his aching eyes? Because he'd worshipped the god of beer, thats why. He'd broken a commandment and worshipped the false and foamy god of beer. And now he was being punished." -- Nora Roberts]]>

	    <![CDATA["You'll wrest a burning sword from an angel, but you're afraid of bats?&quot;
&quot;I'm not afraid of them. I just don't like them. They're...furry. Flying things shouldn't be furry. It's not right. And if I ever meet the Creator, I'm taking that one up with him.&quot;
&quot;That I'd like to see. Your one and possible only chance to get the answer to every question in the universe, and you ask, 'Why are bats furry?'&quot;
&quot;I will. You just wait." -- Kelley Armstrong]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["On the darkest days you have to search for a spot of brightness, on the coldest days you have to seek out a spot of warmth; on the bleakest days you have to keep your eyes onward and upward and on the saddest days you have to leave them open to let them cry. To then let them dry. To give them a chance in order to see fresh and clear once again." -- Tahereh Mafi]]>
