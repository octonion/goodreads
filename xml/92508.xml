		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Whether I like it or not, most of my images of what various historical periods feel, smell, or sound like were acquired well before I set foot in any history class. They came from Margaret Mitchell, from Anya Seton, from M.M. Kaye, and a host of other authors, in their crackly plastic library bindings. Whether historians acknowledge it or not, scholarly historyâ€™s illegitimate cousin, the historical novel, plays a profound role in shaping widely held conceptions of historical realities." -- Lauren Willig]]>

Because, well, I mean, there are billions and billions of questions out there, and well, when I say billions, I mean, when you add in the answers, not just the questions, weeelll, you're looking at numbers that are positively astronomical and... for that matter the other question is what you lot are doing on this planet in the first place, and er, did anyone try just pushing this little red button?" -- Neil Gaiman]]>

	    <![CDATA["All right,&quot; said Susan. &quot;I'm not stupid. You're saying humans need... &lt;i&gt;fantasies&lt;/i&gt; to make life bearable.&quot;

REALLY? AS IF IT WAS SOME KIND OF PINK PILL? NO. HUMANS NEED FANTASY TO BE HUMAN. TO BE THE PLACE WHERE THE FALLING ANGEL MEETS THE RISING APE.

&quot;Tooth fairies? Hogfathers? Littleâ€”&quot;

YES. AS PRACTICE. YOU HAVE TO START OUT LEARNING TO BELIEVE THE &lt;i&gt;LITTLE&lt;/i&gt; LIES.

&quot;So we can believe the big ones?&quot;

YES. JUSTICE. MERCY. DUTY. THAT SORT OF THING.

&quot;They're not the same at all!&quot;

YOU THINK SO? THEN TAKE THE UNIVERSE AND GRIND IT DOWN TO THE FINEST POWDER AND SIEVE IT THROUGH THE FINEST SIEVE AND THEN &lt;i&gt;SHOW&lt;/i&gt; ME ONE ATOM OF JUSTICE, ONE MOLECULE OF MERCY. AND YETâ€”Death waved a hand. AND YET YOU ACT AS IF THERE IS SOME IDEAL ORDER IN THE WORLD, AS IF THERE IS SOME...SOME &lt;i&gt;RIGHTNESS&lt;/i&gt; IN THE UNIVERSE BY WHICH IT MAY BE JUDGED.

&quot;Yes, but people have &lt;i&gt;got&lt;/i&gt; to believe that, or what's the &lt;i&gt;point&lt;/i&gt;â€”&quot;

MY POINT EXACTLY." -- Terry Pratchett]]>
