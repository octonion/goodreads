	    <![CDATA["You have a dress with a décolletage to emphasise your breasts. I suppose the cleavage is the proper focus but what I wanted to do was to fasten my index finger and thumb at the bolts of your collar bone, push out, spreading the web of my hand until it caught against your throat. You asked me if I wanted to strangle you. No, I wanted to fit you, not just in the obvious ways but in so many indentations." -- Jeanette Winterson]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Involved. At least that was the right word, Alsana reflected, as she liftes her foot off the pedal, and let the wheel spin a few times alone before coming to a squeaky halt. Sometimes, here in England, especially at bus-stops and on the daytime soaps, you heard people say “We’re involved with each other,” as if this were a most wonderful state to be in, as if one chose it and enjoyed it. Alsana never thought of it that way. Involved happened over a long period of time, pulling you in like quicksand. Involved is what befell the moon-faced Alsana Begum and the handsome Samad Miah one week after they’d been pushed into a Delhi breakfast room together and informed they were to marry. Involved was the result when Clara Bowden met Archie Jones at the bottom of some stairs. Involved swallowed up a girl called Ambrosia and a boy called Charlie (yes, Clara had told her that sorry tale) the second they kissed in the larder of a guest house. Involved is neither good, nor bad. It is just a consequence of living, a consequence of occupation and immigration, of empires and expansion, of living in each other’s pockets… one becomes involved and it is a long trek back to being uninvolved. And the woman was right, one didn’t do it for one’s health. Nothing this late in the century was done with health in mind. Alsana was no dummy when it came to the Modern Condition. She watched the talk shows, all day long she watched the talk shows — My wife slept with my brother, My mother won’t stay out of my boyfriend’s life — and the microphone holder, whether it be Tanned Man with White Teeth or Scary Married Couple, always asked the same damn silly question: But why do you feel the need…? Wrong! Alsana had to explain it to them through the screen. You blockhead; they are not wanting this, they are not willing it — they are just involved, see? They walk IN and they get trapped between the revolving doors of those two v’s. Involved. Just a tired inevitable fact. Something in the way Joyce said it, involved — wearied, slightly acid — suggested to Alsana that the word meant the same thing to hear. An enormous web you spin to catch yourself." -- Zadie Smith]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Wishes of one's old life wither and shrivel like old leaves if they are not replaced with new wishes when the world changes. And the world always changes. Wishes get slimy, and their colors fade, and soon they are just mud, like all the rest of the mud, and not wishes at all, but regrets. The trouble is, not everyone can tell when they ought to launder their wishes. Even when one finds oneself in Fairyland and not at home at all, it is not always so easy to remember to catch the world in it's changing and change with it." -- Catherynne M. Valente]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["It comes from a very ancient democracy, you see...&quot;
&quot;You mean, it comes from a world of lizards?&quot;
&quot;No,&quot; said Ford, who by this time was a little more rational and coherent than he had been, having finally had the coffee forced down him, &quot;nothing so simple. Nothing anything like so straightforward. On its world, the people are people. The leaders are lizards. The people hate the lizards and the lizards rule the people.&quot;
&quot;Odd,&quot; said Arthur, &quot;I thought you said it was a democracy.&quot;
&quot;I did,&quot; said Ford. &quot;It is.&quot;
&quot;So,&quot; said Arthur, hoping he wasn't sounding ridiculously obtuse, &quot;why don't people get rid of the lizards?&quot;
&quot;It honestly doesn't occur to them,&quot; said Ford. &quot;They've all got the vote, so they all pretty much assume that the government they've voted in more or less approximates to the government they want.&quot;
&quot;You mean they actually vote for the lizards?&quot;
&quot;Oh yes,&quot; said Ford with a shrug, &quot;of course.&quot;
&quot;But,&quot; said Arthur, going for the big one again, &quot;why?&quot;
&quot;Because if they didn't vote for a lizard,&quot; said Ford, &quot;the wrong lizard might get in. Got any gin?&quot;
&quot;What?&quot;
&quot;I said,&quot; said Ford, with an increasing air of urgency creeping into his voice, &quot;have you got any gin?&quot;
&quot;I'll look. Tell me about the lizards.&quot;
Ford shrugged again.
&quot;Some people say that the lizards are the best thing that ever happenned to them,&quot; he said. &quot;They're completely wrong of course, completely and utterly wrong, but someone's got to say it.&quot;
&quot;But that's terrible,&quot; said Arthur.
&quot;Listen, bud,&quot; said Ford, &quot;if I had one Altairian dollar for every time I heard one bit of the Universe look at another bit of the Universe and say 'That's terrible' I wouldn't be sitting here like a lemon looking for a gin." -- Douglas Adams]]>

	    <![CDATA["The Marquis sighed. &quot;I thought it was just a legend,&quot; he said. &quot;Like the alligators in the sewers of New York City.&quot;
Old Bailey nodded, sagely: &quot;What, the big white buggers? They're down there. I had a friend lost a head to one of them.&quot; A moment of silence. Old Naeiley handed the statue back to the Marquis. Then he raised his hand, and snapped it, like a crocodile hand, at the Carabas. &quot;It was OK,&quot; gurned Old Bailey with a grin that was most terrible to behold. &quot;He had another." -- Neil Gaiman]]>

	    <![CDATA["Don't you see that the whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range of thought?... Has it ever occurred to you, Winston, that by the year 2050, at the very latest, not a single human being will be alive who could understand such a conversation as we are having now?... The whole climate of thought will be different. In fact, there will be no thought, as we understand it now. Orthodoxy means not thinking-not needing to think. Orthodoxy is unconsciousness." -- George Orwell]]>

	    <![CDATA["Right.  I look fine. Except I don't,' said Zora, tugging sadly at her man's nightshirt.  This was why Kiki had dreaded having girls: she knew she wouldn't be able to protect them from self-disgust.  To that end she had tried banning television in the early years, and never had a lipstick or a woman's magazine crossed the threshold of the Belsey home to Kiki's knowledge, but these and other precautionary measures had made no difference.  It was in the air, or so it seemed to Kiki, this hatred of women and their bodies-- it seeped in with every draught in the house; people brought it home on their shoes, they breathed it in off their newspapers.  There was no way to control it." -- Zadie Smith]]>

In that moment our actions will define us.  And it makes no difference whether you are being watched by Allah, Jesus, Buddah, or whether you are not.  On cold days a man can see his breath, on a hot day he can't.  On both occasions, the man &lt;i&gt;breathes&lt;/i&gt;." -- Zadie Smith]]>

Sweet it was, sweet and gone too soon.  Dawn came cruel, a dagger of light.  She woke aching and alone and weary; weary of riding, weary of hurting, weary of duty.  I want to weep, she thought, I want to be comforted.  I'm so tired of being strong.  I want to be foolish and frightened for once.  Just for a small while, that's all . . . a day . . . an hour . . ." -- George R.R. Martin]]>

	    <![CDATA["One ought not to judge her: all children are Heartless. They have not grown a heart yet, which is why they can climb high trees and say shocking things and leap so very high grown-up hearts flutter in terror. Hearts weigh quite a lot. That is why it takes so long to grow one. But, as in their reading and arithmetic and drawing, different children proceed at different speeds. (It is well known that reading quickens the growth of a heart like nothing else.) Some small ones are terrible and fey, Utterly Heartless. Some are dear and sweet and Hardly Heartless At All. September stood very generally in the middle on the day the Green Wind took her, Somewhat Heartless, and Somewhat Grown." -- Catherynne M. Valente]]>

He paused a moment. “Come up and see,” he suggested. “I can give you a cup of tea in no time—and you won’t meet any bores.”&lt;p&gt;
Her colour deepened—she still had the art of blushing at the right time—but she took the suggestion as lightly as it was made.&lt;p&gt;
“Why not? It’s too tempting—I’ll take the risk,” she declared.&lt;p&gt;
“Oh, I’m not dangerous,” he said in the same key.&lt;p&gt;
In truth, he had never liked her as well as at that moment. He knew she had accepted without afterthought: he could never be a factor in her calculations, and there was a surprise, a refreshment almost, in the spontaneity of her consent." -- Edith Wharton]]>

I'm just saying sometimes it seems that way, and that those details (a thigh mole, a full face flush, a scar the precise shape and size of a cashew nut) are so many hooks waiting to land you." -- Zadie Smith]]>

	    <![CDATA["It's an abominable fallacy that suffering makes for greater art.  Suffering blinds, deafens, ruins, and often kills.  Osip Mandelstam was a great poet &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; the revolution.  So was Anna Akhmatova, so was Marina Tsvetaeva.  They would have become what they became even if none of the historical events that befell Russia in this century had taken place:  because they were &lt;i&gt;gifted&lt;/i&gt;.  Basically, talent doesn't need history." -- Joseph Brodsky]]>

	    <![CDATA["She did not know yet how sometimes people keep parts of themselves hidden and secret, sometimes wicked and unkind parts, but often brave or wild or colorful parts, cunning or powerful or even marvelous, beautiful parts, just locked up away at the bottom of their hearts. They do this because they are afraid of the world and of being stared at, or relied upon to do feats of bravery or boldness. And all of those brave and wild and cunning and marvelous and beautiful parts they hid away and left in the dark to grow strange mushrooms—and yes, sometimes those wicked and unkind parts, too—end up in their shadow." -- Catherynne M. Valente]]>
