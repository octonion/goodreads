		<description>
	    <![CDATA["So we dream on.  Thus we invent our lives.  We give ourselves a sainted mother, we make our father a hero; and someone’s older brother and someone’s older sister – they become our heroes too.  We invent what we love and what we fear.  There is always a brave lost brother – and a little lost sister, too.  We dream on and on: the best hotel, the perfect family, the resort life.  And our dreams escape us almost as vividly as we can imagine them…  That’s what happens, like it or not.  And because that’s what happens, this is what we need: we need a good, smart bear…  Coach Bob knew it all along: you’ve got to get obsessed and stay obsessed. You have to keep passing the open windows." -- John Irving]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["She introduces me to a nurse as the Best Friend. The impersonal article is more intimate. It tells me that &lt;i&gt;they&lt;/i&gt; are intimate, the nurse and my friend.
'I was telling her we used to drink Canada Dry ginger ale and pretend were were in Canada' 
'That's how dumb we were,' I say. 
'You could be sisters,' the nurse says. 
So how come, I'll bet they are wondering, it took me so long to get to such a glorious place? But do they ask? 
They do not ask. 
Two months, and how long is the drive? 
The best I can explain it is this - I have a friend who worked one summer in a mortuary. He used to tell me stories. The one that really got to me was not eh grisliest, but it's the one that did. A man wrecked his care on 101 going south. He did not lose consciousness. But his arm was taken down to the bone - and when he looked at it - it scared him to death. 
I mean, he died. 
So I hadn't dared to look any closer. But now I'm doing it - and hoping that I will live through it." -- Amy Hempel]]>

	    <![CDATA["I am late,' she said, 'I know that I am late. So many little things have to be done when you are alone, and I am not yet accustomed to being alone,' she added with a pretty little sob which reminded me of a cut-glass Victorian tear-bottle. She took off thick winter gloves with a wringing gesture which made me think of handkerchiefs wet with grief, and her hands looked suddenly small and useless and vulnerable." -- Graham Greene]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["A motion picture, or music, or television, they have to maintain a certain decorum in order to be broadcast to a vast audience. Other forms of mass media cost too much to produce a risk reaching only a limited audience. Only one person. But a book. . . . A book is cheap to print and bind. A book is as private and consensual as sex. A book takes time and effort to consume - something that gives a reader every chance to walk away. Actually, so few people make the effort to read that it's difficult to call books a &quot;mass medium.&quot; No one really gives a damn about books. No one has bothered to ban a book in decades." -- Chuck Palahniuk]]>

The looks they gave me as they passed were the looks I give when the door of a limousine opens. You always expect to see a movie star, or, at the very least, some better dressed than you, but time and time again it's just a sloppy nobody. Thus the look, which translates to, Fuck you, Sloppy Nobody, for making me turn my head." -- David Sedaris]]>

His family left there in the midsixties and moved to the Congo. After that, it was Ethiopia, and then Somalia, all fine places in his opinion.
'Let's save Africa and the Middle East for when I decide to quit living,' I said." -- David Sedaris]]>

Roy Johnson, the poolhall boy, had found her in a bar and took her to a hotel; pride taking over his sense, he invited the whole gang to come up and see her. Everybody sat around talking with Camille. Dean did nothing but look out a window. Then when everybody left, Dean merely looked at Camille, pointed at his wrist, made the sign 'four' (meaning he'd be back at four), and went on. At three the door was locked to Roy Johnson. At four it was open to Dean. I wanted to go right out and see the madman." -- Jack Kerouac]]>

	    <![CDATA["Standing there, the doctor's wife watched the two blind men who were arguing, she noticed they made no gestures, that they barely moved their bodies, having quickly learned that only their voice and hearing now served any purpose, true, they had their arms, that they could fight, grapple, come to blows, as the saying goes, but a bed swapped by mistake was not worth so much fuss, if only all life's deceptions were like this one, and all they had to do was to come to some agreement, Number two is mine, yours is number three, let that be understood once and for all, Were it not for the fact that we're blind this mix-up would never had happened, You're right, our problem is that we're blind. The doctor's wife said to her husband, The whole world is right here." -- Saramago, José]]>
