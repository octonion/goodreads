	    <![CDATA["Finish each day and be done with it. You have done what you could.  Some blunders and absurdities no doubt crept in; forget them as soon as you can. Tomorrow is a new day.  You shall begin it serenely and with too high a spirit to be encumbered with your old nonsense." -- Ralph Waldo Emerson]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["He has achieved success who has lived well, laughed often, and loved much;
Who has enjoyed the trust of pure women, the respect of intelligent men and the love of little children;
Who has filled his niche and accomplished his task;
Who has never lacked appreciation of Earth's beauty or failed to express it;
Who has left the world better than he found it,
Whether an improved poppy, a perfect poem, or a rescued soul;
Who has always looked for the best in others and given them the best he had;
Whose life was an inspiration;
Whose memory a benediction." -- Bessie Anderson Stanley]]>

	    <![CDATA["There is a time in every man's education when he arrives at the conviction that envy is ignorance; that imitation is suicide; that he must take himself for better, for worse, as his portion; that though the wide universe is full of good, no kernel of nourishing corn can come to him but through his toil bestowed on that plot of ground which is given to him to till. The power which resides in him is new in nature, and none but he knows what that is which he can do, nor does he know until he has tried." -- Ralph Waldo Emerson]]>

	    <![CDATA["&lt;b&gt;The Poet With His Face In His Hands&lt;/b&gt;

You want to cry aloud for your
 mistakes. But to tell the truth the world
 doesn’t need anymore of that sound.

So if you’re going to do it and can’t
 stop yourself, if your pretty mouth can’t
 hold it in, at least go by yourself across

the forty fields and the forty dark inclines
 of rocks and water to the place where
 the falls are flinging out their white sheets

like crazy, and there is a cave behind all that
 jubilation and water fun and you can
 stand there, under it, and roar all you

want and nothing will be disturbed; you can
 drip with despair all afternoon and still,
 on a green branch, its wings just lightly touched

by the passing foil of the water, the thrush,
 puffing out its spotted breast, will sing
 of the perfect, stone-hard beauty of everything." -- Mary Oliver]]>

	    <![CDATA["When despair for the world grows in me and I wake in the night at the least sound in fear of what my life and my children's lives may be, I go and lie down where the wood drake rests in his beauty on the water, and the great heron feeds. I come into the peace of wild things who do not tax their lives with forethought of grief. I come into the presence of still water. And I feel above me the day-blind stars waiting with their light. For a time I rest in the grace of the world, and am free." -- Wendell Berry]]>
