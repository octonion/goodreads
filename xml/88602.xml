		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Driving home, I heard the explosion and thought it was a new story born. But, Adrian, it’s the same old story, whispered past the same false teeth. How can we imagine a new language when the language of the enemy keeps our dismembered tongues tied to his belt? How can we imagine a new alphabet when the old jumps off billboards down into our stomachs? Adrian, what did you say? I want to rasp into sober cryptology and say something dynamic but tonight is my laundry night. How do we imagine a new life when a pocketful of quarters weighs our possibilities down?" -- Sherman Alexie]]>

	    <![CDATA["Night poured over the desert. It came suddenly, in purple. In the clear air, the stars drilled down out of the sky, reminding any thoughtful watcher that it is in the deserts and high places that religions are generated. When men see nothing but bottomless infinity over their heads they have always had a driving and desperate urge to find someone to put in the way." -- Terry Pratchett ]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["One describes a tale best by telling the tale. You see? The way one describes a story, to oneself or to the world, is by telling the story. It is a balancing act and it is a dream. The more accurate the map, the more it resembles the territory. The most accurate map possible would be the territory, and thus would be perfectly accurate and perfectly useless. 
The tale is the map that is the territory.
You must remember this." -- Neil Gaiman]]>

	    <![CDATA["There was a tale he had read once, long ago, as a small boy: the story of a traveler who had slipped down a cliff, with man-eating tigers above him and a lethal fall below him, who managed to stop his fall halfway down the side of the cliff, holding on for dear life. There was a clump of strawberries beside him, and certain death above him and below. What should he do? went the question. 

And the reply was, Eat the strawberries.

The story had never made sense to him as a boy. It did now." -- Neil Gaiman]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["It's perfectly simple,&quot; said Wednesday.  &quot;In other countries, over the years, people recognized the places of power.  Sometimes it would be a natural formation, sometimes it would just be a place that was, somehow, special.  They knew that something important was happening there, that there was some focusing point, some channel, some window to the Immanent.  And so they would build temples or cathedrals, or erect stone circles, or...well, you get the idea.&quot;

   &quot;There are churches all across the States, though,&quot; said Shadow.

   &quot;In every town.  Sometimes on every block.  And about as significant, in this context, as dentists' offices.  No, in the USA, people still get the call, or some of them, and they feel themselves being called to from the transcendent void, and they respond to it by building a model out of beer bottles of somewhere they've never visited, or by erecting a gigantic bat house in some part of the country that bats have traditionally declined to visit.  Roadside attractions: people feel themselves pulled to places where, in other parts of the world, they would recognize that part of themselves that is truly transcendent, and buy a hot dog, and walk around, feeling satisfied on a level they cannot truly describe, and profoundly dissatisfied on a level beneath that." -- Neil Gaiman]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Do you know when they say soulmates? Everybody uses it in personal ads. “Soul mate wanted.” It doesn’t mean too much now. But soulmates – think about it. When your soul – whatever that is anyway – something so alive when you make music or love and so mysteriously hidden most of the rest of the time, so colorful and big but without color or shape – when your soul finds another soul it can recognize even before the rest of you knows about it. The rest of you just feels sweaty and jumpy at first. And your souls get married without even meaning to – even if you can’t be together for some reason in real life, your souls just go ahead and make the wedding plans. A soul’s wedding must be too beautiful to even look at. It must be blinding. It must be like all the weddings in the world – gondolas with canopies of doves, champagne glasses shattering, wings of veils, drums beating, flutes and trumpets, showers of roses. And after that happens you know – that’s it. This is it." -- Francesca Lia Block]]>

	    <![CDATA["There are stories that are true, in which each individual's tale is unique and tragic, and the worst of the tragedy is that we have heard it before, and we cannot allow ourselves to feel it to deeply.  We build a shell around it like an oyster dealing with a painful particle of grit, coating it with smooth pearl layers in order to cope.  This is how we walk and talk and function, day in, day out, immune to others' pain and loss.  If it were to touch us it would cripple us or make saints of us; but, for the most part, it does not touch us.  We cannot allow it to." -- Neil Gaiman]]>
