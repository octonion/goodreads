		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Jesus said several times, “Come, follow me.” His was a program of “do what I do,” rather than “do what I say.” His innate brilliance would have permitted him to put on a dazzling display, but that would have left his followers far behind. He walked and worked with those he was to serve. His was not a long-distance leadership. He was not afraid of close friendships; he was not afraid that proximity to him would disappoint his followers. The leaven of true leadership cannot lift others unless we are with and serve those to be led." -- Spencer W. Kimball]]>

	    <![CDATA["As an inmate of a concentration camp, Corrie Ten Boom heard a commotion, and saw a short distance away a prison guard mercilessly beating a female prisoner.  “What can we do for these people?” Corrie whispered.  “Show them that love is greater,” Betsie replied.  In that moment, Corrie realized her sister’s focus was on the prison guard, not the victim she was watching.  Betsie saw the world through a different lens.  She considered the actions of greatest moral gravity to be the ones we originate, not the ones we suffer." -- Terryl L. Givens]]>
