	    <![CDATA["You may not remember the time you let me go first. 
Or the time you dropped back to tell me it wasn't that far to go. 
Or the time you waited at the crossroads for me to catch up. 
You may not remember any of those, but I do and this is what I have to say to you: 

Today, no matter what it takes, 
we ride home together." -- Brian Andreas]]>

	    <![CDATA["If there's just one kind of folks, why can't they get along with each other? If they're all alike, why do they go out of their way to despise each other? Scout, I think I'm beginning to understand something. I think I'm beginning to understand why Boo Radley's stayed shut up in the house all this time. It's because he wants to stay inside." -- Harper Lee]]>
