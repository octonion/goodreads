	    <![CDATA["Perhaps the most fulfilling thing in medicine is sitting with a patient who has been saddled with a chronic disease for years and had lots of concerns about cirrhosis, liver failure, the possibility of having to have a liver transplant, the possibly of developing cancer in the liver, a patient who has fought through a year-long treatment with side effects including sleep disturbances, irritability, a mental fog and being able to tell him, “Mr. Tyler, you’re cured. You don’t need to see me again." -- Deepak Chopra]]>
