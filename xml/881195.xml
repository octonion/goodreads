	    <![CDATA["That wind! ...it called to mind the small, scarce, stemmy flowers that she and Edmund would walk half a day to pick, though in another day they would all be wilted. Sometimes Edmund would carry buckets and a trowel, and lift them earth and all, and bring them home to plant, and they would die. They were rare things, and grew out of ants' nests and bear dung and the flesh of perished animals." -- Marilynne Robinson]]>

	    <![CDATA["Did I tell you about Anton?&quot; Loots said.

Anton?&quot; I shook my head.

It was a week ago, Loots said. There had been a knock on the door of his apartment and when he opened it his old friend Anton was standing there. Anton was a clown. He belonged to a circus that toured the provinces, playing to small towns and villages. They talked about the old days for a while, but Anton became increasingly restless and distracted. In the end Loots had to ask him if there was something wrong.

This is going to sound strange.&quot; The clown coughed nervously into his fist. &quot;It's The Invisible Man. He's disappeared.&quot;

Loots stared at his friend.

He just vanished,&quot; Anton said, &quot;into thin air.&quot;

The Invisible Man?&quot; Loots said.

Yes.&quot;

He's disappeared?&quot;

I told you it would sound strange,&quot; Anton said." -- Rupert Thomson]]>
