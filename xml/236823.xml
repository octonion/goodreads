	    <![CDATA["Hey, what is it with you? Why are you so spaced out? You still haven't answered me.&quot;

I probably still haven't completely adapted to the world,&quot; I said after giving it some thought. &quot;I don't know, I feel like this isn't the real world. The people, the scene: they just don't seem real to me.&quot;

Midori rested an elbow on the bar and looked at me. &quot;There was something like that in a Jim Morrison song, I'm pretty sure.&quot;

People are strange when you're a stranger." -- Haruki Murakami]]>
