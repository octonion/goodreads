	    <![CDATA["So we dream on.  Thus we invent our lives.  We give ourselves a sainted mother, we make our father a hero; and someone’s older brother and someone’s older sister – they become our heroes too.  We invent what we love and what we fear.  There is always a brave lost brother – and a little lost sister, too.  We dream on and on: the best hotel, the perfect family, the resort life.  And our dreams escape us almost as vividly as we can imagine them…  That’s what happens, like it or not.  And because that’s what happens, this is what we need: we need a good, smart bear…  Coach Bob knew it all along: you’ve got to get obsessed and stay obsessed. You have to keep passing the open windows." -- John Irving]]>

	    <![CDATA["But I felt certain that if the world would stop indulging wars and famines and other perils, it would be possible for human beings to embarrass each other to death.  Our self-destruction might take a little longer that way, but I believe it would be no less complete." -- John Irving]]>

	    <![CDATA["Which is why we have spouses and children and parents and colleagues and friends, because someone has to know us better than we know ourselves.  We need them to tell us.  We need them to say, &quot;I know you, Al.  You are not the kind of man who." -- Richard Russo]]>
