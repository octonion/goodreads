		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Some people will tell you that slow is good – but I’m here to tell you that fast is better.  I’ve always believed this, in spite of the trouble it’s caused me.  Being shot out of a cannon will always be better than being squeezed out of a tube.  That is why God made fast motorcycles, Bubba…" -- Hunter S. Thompson]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body, but rather to skid in broadside in a cloud of smoke, thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and loudly proclaiming &quot;Wow! What a Ride!" -- Hunter S. Thompson]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["We are all alone, born alone, die alone, and -- in spite of True Romance magazines -- we shall all someday look back on our lives and see that, in spite of our company, we were alone the whole way. I do not say lonely -- at least, not all the time -- but essentially, and finally, alone. This is what makes your self-respect so important, and I don't see how you can respect yourself if you must look in the hearts and minds of others for your happiness." -- Hunter S. Thompson]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["There are times, however, and this is one of them, when even being right feels wrong. What do you say, for instance, about a generation that has been taught that rain is poison and sex is death? If making love might be fatal and if a cool spring breeze on any summer afternoon can turn a crystal blue lake into a puddle of black poison right in front of your eyes, there is not much left except TV and relentless masturbation. It's a strange world. Some people get rich and others eat shit and die." -- Hunter S. Thompson]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Actual happiness always looks pretty squalid in comparison with the overcompensations for misery. And, of course, stability isn't nearly so spectacular as instability. And being contented has none of the glamour of a good fight against misfortune, none of the picturesqueness of a struggle with temptation, or a fatal overthrow by passion or doubt. Happiness is never grand." -- Aldous Huxley]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The real hopeless victims of mental illness are to be found among those who appear to be most normal. &quot;Many of them are normal because they are so well adjusted to our mode of existence, because their human voice has been silenced so early in their lives, that they do not even struggle or suffer or develop symptoms as the neurotic does.&quot; They are normal not in what may be called the absolute sense of the word; they are normal only in relation to a profoundly abnormal society. Their perfect adjustment to that abnormal society is a measure of their mental sickness. These millions of abnormally normal people, living without fuss in a society to which, if they were fully human beings, they ought not to be adjusted." -- Aldous Huxley]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Chronic remorse, as all the moralists are agreed, is a most undesirable sentiment. If you have behaved badly, repent, make what amends you can and address yourself to the task of behaving better next time. On no account brood over your wrongdoing. Rolling in the muck is not the best way of getting clean." -- Aldous Huxley]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["All right then,&quot; said the savage defiantly, I'm claiming the right to be unhappy.&quot;
&quot;Not to mention the right to grow old and ugly and impotent; the right to have syphilis and cancer; the right to have too little to eat, the right to be lousy; the right to live in constant apprehension of what may happen tomorrow; the right to catch typhoid; the right to be tortured by unspeakable pains of every kind.&quot; 
There was a long silence.
&quot;I claim them all,&quot; said the Savage at last." -- Aldous Huxley]]>

	    <![CDATA["There was a thing called Heaven; but all the same they used to drink enormous quantities of alcohol.&quot;
...
&quot;There was a thing called the soul and a thing called immortality.&quot;
...
&quot;But they used to take morphia and cocaine.&quot;
...
&quot;Two thousand pharmacologists and biochemists were subsidized in A.F. 178.&quot;
...
&quot;Six years later it was being produced commercially. The perfect drug.&quot;
...
&quot;Euphoric, narcotic, pleasantly hallucinant.&quot;
...
&quot;All the advantages of Christianity and alcohol; none of their defects.&quot;
...
&quot;Take a holiday from reality whenever you like, and come back without so much as a headache or a mythology.&quot;

&quot;Stability was practically assured." -- Aldous Huxley]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The Savage nodded, frowning. &quot;You got rid of them. Yes, that's just like you. Getting rid of everything unpleasant instead of learning to put up with it. Whether 'tis better in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows or outrageous fortune, or to take arms against a sea of troubles and by opposing end them...But you don't do either. Neither suffer nor oppose. You just abolish the slings and arrows. It's too easy.&quot;  

   ...&quot;What you need,&quot; the Savage went on, &quot;is something &lt;i&gt;with&lt;/i&gt; tears for a change. Nothing costs enough here." -- Aldous Huxley]]>
