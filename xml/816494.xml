	    <![CDATA["If it crosses your mind that water running through hundreds of miles of open ditch in a desert will evaporate and end up full of concentrated salts and muck, then let me just tell you, that kind of negative thinking will never get you elected to public office in the state of Arizona.  When this giant new tap turned on, developers drew up plans to roll pink stucco subdivisions across the desert in all directions.  The rest of us were supposed to rejoice as the new flow rushed into our pipes, even as the city warned us this water was kind of special.  They said it was okay to drink but don't put it in an aquarium because it would kill the fish.

Drink it we did, then, filled our coffee makers too, and mixed our children's juice concentrate with fluid that would gag a guppy.  Oh, America the Beautiful, where are our standards?  " -- Barbara Kingsolver]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["When we traded homemaking for careers, we were implicitly promised economic independence and worldly influence. But a devil of a bargain it has turned out to be in terms of daily life. We gave up the aroma of warm bread rising, the measured pace of nurturing routines, the creative task of molding our families' tastes and zest for life; we received in exchange the minivan and the Lunchable." -- Barbara Kingsolver]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["	“Tortolita, let me tell you a story,” Estevan said.  “This is a South American, wild Indian story about heaven and hell.”  Mrs. Parsons made a prudish face, and Estevan went on.  “If you go visit hell, you will see a room like this kitchen.  There is a pot of delicious stew on the table, with the most delicate aroma you can imagine.  All around, people sit, like us.  Only they are dying of starvation.  They are jibbering and jabbering,” he looked extra hard at Mrs. Parsons, “but they cannot get a bit of this wonderful stew God has made for them.  Now, why is that?”
	“Because they’re choking?  For all eternity?” Lou Ann asked.  Hell, for Lou Ann, would naturally be a place filled with sharp objects and small round foods.
	“No,” he said.  “Good guess, but no.  They are starving because they only have spoons with very long handles.  As long as that.”  He pointed to the mop, which I had forgotten to put away.  “With these ridiculous, terrible spoons, the people in hell can reach into the pot but they cannot put the food in their mouths.  Oh, how hungry they are!  Oh, how they swear and curse each other!” he said, looking again at Virgie.  He was enjoying this.
	“Now,” he went on, “you can go and visit heaven.  What?  You see a room just like the first one, the same table, the same pot of stew, the same spoons as long as a sponge mop.  But these people are all happy and fat.”
	“Real fat, or do you mean just well-fed?” Lou Ann asked.
	“Just well-fed,” he said.  “Perfectly, magnificently well-fed, and very happy.  Why do you think?”
	He pinched up a chunk of pineapple in his chopsticks, neat as you please, and reached all the way across the table to offer it to Turtle.  She took it like a newborn bird." -- Barbara Kingsolver]]>

And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do." -- Apple Computer Inc.]]>

There's no use in trying,' Alice said.  'One can't believe impossible things.'  
I daresay you haven't had much practice,' said the Queen.  'When I was your age, I always did it for half-an-hour a day.  Why, sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast." -- Barbara Kingsolver]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The longer I think about a food industry organized around an animal that cannot reproduce itself without technical assistance, the more I mistrust it.  Poultry, a significant part of the modern diet, is emblematic of the whole dirty deal.  Having no self-sustaining bloodlines to back up the industry is like having no gold standard to underpin paper currency.  Maintaining a natural breeding poultry flock is a rebellion, at the most basic level, against the wholly artificial nature of how foods are produced.  " -- Barbara Kingsolver]]>
