	    <![CDATA["Sometimes I heard voices muttering in my head, and a lot of the time the world seemed to smolder around its edges. but I was in a little better physical shape every day, I was getting my looks back, and my spirits were rising, and this was all in all a happy time for me. All these weirdos, and me getting a little better right in the midst of them. I had never known, never even imagined for a heartbeat, that there might be a place for people like us." -- Denis Johnson]]>

	    <![CDATA["I have never been able to understand the complaint that a story is &quot;depressing&quot; because of its subject matter. What depresses me are stories that don't seem to know these things go on, or hide them in resolute chipperness; &quot;witty stories,&quot; in which every problem is the occasion for a joke; &quot;upbeat&quot; stories that flog you with transcendence. Please. We're grown ups now." -- Tobias Wolff]]>
