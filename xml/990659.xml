	    <![CDATA["Prince Ronald said, Elizabeth, your hair is all dirty.  You are wearing an ugly paper bag.  You don't have any shoes on and you smell like a dragon's ear.  Come back and rescue me when you're dressed like a real princess.

Elizabeth said, Ronald, your hair is all nice.  Your clothes are all pretty.  You look like a nice guy, but guess what?  You are a bum.

They didn't get married after all." -- Robert Munsch]]>
