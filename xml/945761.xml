	    <![CDATA["The temptation to second-guess is strong. But I must remember one thing. 

Life is simple.

You are healthy or you are sick. You are faithful to your wife or you aren't. You are alive or you are dead. 

I am alive." -- Greg Iles]]>

	    <![CDATA["We cultivate love when we allow our most vulnerable and powerful selves to be deeply seen and known, and when we honor the spiritual connection that grows from that offering with trust, respect, kindness and affection.

Love is not something we give or get; it is something that we nurture and grow, a connection that can only be cultivated between two people when it exists within each one of them – we can only love others as much as we love ourselves.

Shame, blame, disrespect, betrayal, and the withholding of affection damage the roots from which love grows. Love can only survive these injuries if they are acknowledged, healed and rare." -- Brené Brown]]>
