	    <![CDATA["As Henry Dan Piper, one of Fitzgerald's most perceptive critics, has commented, his fiction heroes &quot;are destroyed because they attempt to fulfill themselves through their social relationships. They cannot distinguish between social values like popularity, charm, and success, and the more lasting moral values.&quot; Their creator did make that distinction, however, and so was constantly surrounding his characters with a mist of admiration and then blowing it away." -- Scott Donaldson]]>

	    <![CDATA["The self has no sign of itself... For me, certain signifiers fit you, and not others. For me, all signifiers fit me, one as well as another. I am rascal, hero, craven, brave, treacherous, loyal, at once the secret hero and asshole of the Cosmos." -- Walker Percy]]>
