		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I don't want to drive up to the pearly gates in a shiny sports car, wearing beautifully, tailored clothes, my hair expertly coiffed, and with long, perfectly manicured fingernails.
I want to drive up in a station wagon that has mud on the wheels from taking kids to scout camp.
I want to be there with a smudge of peanut butter on my shirt from making sandwiches for a sick neighbors children.
I want to be there with a little dirt under my fingernails from helping to weed someone's garden.
I want to be there with children's sticky kisses on my cheeks and the tears of a friend on my shoulder.
I want the Lord to know I was really here and that I really lived." -- Marjorie Pay Hinckley]]>

These friendships are a necessary source of sustenance. We need to renew our faith every day. We need to lock arms and help build the kingdom so that it will roll forth and fill the whole earth." -- Marjorie Pay Hinckley]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Think about your particular assignment at this time in your life.  It may be to get an education, it may be to rear children, it may be to be a grandparent, it may be to care for an relieve the suffering of someone you love, it may be to do a job in the most excellent way possible, it may be to support someone who has a difficult assignment of their own.  Our assignments are varied and they change from time to time.  Don't take them lightly.  Give them your full heart and energy.  Do them with enthusiasm.  Do whatever you have to do this week with your whole heart and soul.  To do less than this will leave you with an empty feeling." -- Marjorie Pay Hinckley]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I know it is hard for you young mothers to believe that almost before you can turn around the children will be gone and you will be alone with your husband.  You had better be sure you are developing the kind of love and friendship that will be delightful and enduring.  Let the children learn from your attitude that he is important.  Encourage him.  Be kind.  It is a rough world, and he, like everyone else, is fighting to survive.  Be cheerful.  Don't be a whiner." -- Marjorie Pay Hinckley]]>

	    <![CDATA["Oftentimes the thing that makes the difference between a good student and a poor one, a good learner or a bored human being, is just a little curiosity.  If you have it, cultivate it, feed it.  Never let it go.  If you do not have it - get it.  Wonder, watch, ask questions, be alive.  It's just that simple" -- Marjorie Pay Hinckley]]>

	    <![CDATA["My mother taught me some basic philosophies of rearing children.  One is that you have to trust them.  I tried hard never to say &quot;no&quot; if I could possibly say &quot;yes&quot;.  I think that worked well because it gave my children the feeling that I trusted them and they were responsible to do the best they could." -- Marjorie Pay Hinckley/Small and Simple Things]]>
