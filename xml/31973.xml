		<description>
	    <![CDATA["But this I know; the writer who possesses the creative gift owns something of which he is not always master--something that at times strangely wills and works for itself. He may lay down rules and devise principles, and to rules and principles it will perhaps for years lie in subjection; and then, haply without any warning of revolt, there comes a time when it will no longer consent." -- Charlotte Brontë]]>

’The question is,’ said Humpty Dumpty, ‘which is to be master — that’s all." -- Lewis Carroll]]>

When the creative impulse cannot flourish, when it cannot freely select its methods and objects, when it is deprived of spontaneity, then society severs the root of art." -- John F. Kennedy]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["It is so easy to be hopeful in the daytime when you can see the things you wish on.  But it was night, it stayed night.  Night was striding across nothingness with the whole round world in his hands . . . They sat in company with the others in other shanties, their eyes straining against cruel walls and their souls asking if He meant to measure their puny might against His.  They seemed to be staring at the dark, but their eyes were watching God." -- Zora Neale Hurston]]>

	    <![CDATA["Now it’s high watermark 
and floodtide in the heart
and time to go.
The sea-nymphs in the spray
will be the chorus now.
What’s left to say?

Suspect too much sweet-talk
but never close your mind.
It was a fortunate wind
that blew me here.  I leave
half-ready to believe 
that a crippled trust might walk

and the half-true rhyme is love." -- Seamus Heaney]]>

	    <![CDATA["Atticus said to Jem one day, &quot;I’d rather you shot at tin cans in the backyard, but I know you’ll go after birds.  Shoot all the blue jays you want, if you can hit ‘em, but remember it’s a sin to kill a mockingbird.&quot;  That was the only time I ever heard Atticus say it was a sin to do something, and I asked Miss Maudie about it.  &quot;Your father’s right,&quot; she said.  &quot;Mockingbirds don’t do one thing except make music for us to enjoy.  They don’t eat up people’s gardens, don’t nest in corn cribs, they don’t do one thing but sing their hearts out for us.  That’s why it’s a sin to kill a mockingbird." -- Harper Lee]]>

	    <![CDATA["My heart sings of your longing for me, and my thoughts climb down to marvel at your mercy.  I do not fear as you gather up my days.  Your name is the sweetness of time, and you carry me close into the night, speaking consolations, drawing down lights from the sky, saying, See how the night has no terrors for one who remembers the name." -- Leonard Cohen]]>
