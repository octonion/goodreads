It just has to be.  In time.  In place.  In spirit.
It just has to be." -- David Levithan]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I'd heard people say that as a traveler, you have to be careful not to get attached.  Now that I'd felt it, I'd say that's garbage.  If you are lucky enough to find people worth getting attached to, attach yourself with nothing less than all of your heart.  Because if you find a companion to walk a stretch of the road with you, a person whose warmth and kindness makes your journey feel much brighter, you have no other choice - you are among the very, very fortunate." -- Signe Pike]]>

They don't teach you how to be rich or how to be poor. They don't teach you how to walk away from someone you don't love any longer. They don't teach you how to know what's going on in someone else's mind. They don't teach you what to say to someone who's dying. They don't teach you anything worth knowing." -- Neil Gaiman]]>
