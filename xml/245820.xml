	    <![CDATA["I waited for him to find an answer.  Minutes passed.  It came to me that he had quit.  He had glimpsed a glorious ideal, had struggled toward it and seized it and come to understand it, and was disappointed.  One could sympathize." -- John Gardner]]>

	    <![CDATA["Ummiye is currently working on a screenplay called &quot;Footless on Her Own Feet.&quot;  It tells the story of a handicapped girl whose fifty-year-old mother pushes her to school every day in a wheelbarrow.  Eventually, she wins a national drawing contest, making a super-realistic picture of herself in the wheelbarrow.  With the prize money, she buys a wheelchair.  Like the Arslankoy theatre, the girl's drawing uses artistic representation to change the thing represented.  By drawing a truthful picture of the humiliating wheelbarrow, she transforms it into a dignified wheelchair-- much as a theatre, by representing the injustice of village women's life, might make that life more just.  Nabokov once claimed that the inspiration for Lolita was an art work produced by an ape in the Jardin des Plantes: a drawing of the bars of its cage.  It's a good metaphor for artistic production.  What else do we ever draw besides the bars of our cage, or the wheelbarrow we rode in as crippled children?  How else do cages get smashed?  How else will we stand on our own feet?" -- Elif Batuman]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Theology does not thrive in the world of action and reaction, change: it grows on calm, like the scum on a stagnant pool.  And it flourishes, it prospers, on decline.  Only in a world where everything is patently being lost can a priest stir men's hearts as a poet would by maintaining that nothing is in vain." -- John Gardner]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["She drew herself up to the full height of her slender majesty, towering like some dark angel of defiance above the troubled Gerty, who could only falter out: &quot;Lily, Lily-- how can you laugh about such things?&quot;

&quot;So as not to weep, perhaps.  But no-- I'm not of the tearful order.  I discovered early that crying makes my nose red, and the knowledge has helped me through several painful episodes." -- Edith Wharton]]>
