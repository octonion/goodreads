	    <![CDATA["Blaisedell, the poet, had said to him, 'You love beer so much. I'll bet some day you'll go in and order a beer milk shake.' It was a simple piece of foolery but it had bothered Doc ever since. He wondered what a beer milk shake would taste like. The idea gagged him but he couldn't let it alone. It cropped up every time he had a glass of beer. Would it curdle the milk? Would you add sugar? It was like a shrimp ice cream. Once the thing got into your head you couldn't forget it...If a man ordered a beer milk shake, he thought, he'd better do it in a town where he wasn't known. But then, a man with a beard, ordering a beer milk shake in a town where he wasn't known--they might call the police." -- John Steinbeck]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Danse Russe 

If I when my wife is sleeping 
and the baby and Kathleen 
are sleeping 
and the sun is a flame-white disc 
in silken mists 
above shining trees,-- 
if I in my north room 
dance naked, grotesquely 
before my mirror 
waving my shirt round my head 
and singing softly to myself: 
&quot;I am lonely, lonely. 
I was born to be lonely, 
I am best so!&quot; 
If I admire my arms, my face, 
my shoulders, flanks, buttocks 
against the yellow drawn shades,-- 

Who shall say I am not 
the happy genius of my household?" -- William Carlos Williams]]>

	    <![CDATA["I am the drying meadow; you the unspoken apology; he is the fluctuating distance between mother and son; she is the first gesture that creates a quiet that is full enough to make the baby sleep.

My genes, my love, are rubber bands and rope; make yourself a structure you can live inside.

Amen." -- Aimee Bender]]>

	    <![CDATA["The thing is, it's really hard to be roommates with people if your suitcases are much better than theirs--if yours are really &lt;i&gt;good&lt;/i&gt; ones and theirs aren't.  You think if they're intelligent and all, the other person, and have a good sense of humor, that they don't give a damn whose suitcases are better, but they do.  They really do." -- J.D. Salinger]]>
