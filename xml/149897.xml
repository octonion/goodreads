		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The written word, obviously, is very inward, and when we're reading, we're thinking. It's a sort of spiritual, meditative activity. When we're looking at visual objects, I think our eyes are obviously directed outward, so there's not as much reflective time. And it's the reflectiveness and the spiritual inwardness about reading that appeals to me." -- Joyce Carol Oates]]>

In a word, to let the spiritual unbidden and unconscious grow up through the common. This is to be my symphony." -- William Henry Channing]]>
