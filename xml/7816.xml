	    <![CDATA["The problem, if anything, was precisely the opposite. I had too much to write: 

too many fine and miserable buildings to construct and streets to name and clock towers to set chiming, 

too many characters to raise up from the dirt like flowers whose petals I peeled down to the intricate frail organs within, 

too many terrible genetic and fiduciary secrets to dig up and bury and dig up again, 

too many divorces to grant, 

heirs to disinherit, 

trysts to arrange, 

letters to misdirect into evil hands,

innocent children to slay with rheumatic fever, 

women to leave unfulfilled and hopeless, 

men to drive to adultery and theft, 

fires to ignite at the hearts of ancient houses. " -- Michael Chabon]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Who knows how to make love stay?

1. Tell love you are going to Junior's Deli on Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn to pick up a cheesecake, and if loves stays, it can have half. It will stay.

2. Tell love you want a momento of it and obtain a lock of its hair. Burn the hair in a dime-store incense burner with yin/yang symbols on three sides. Face southwest. Talk fast over the burning hair in a convincingly exotic language. Remove the ashes of the burnt hair and use them to paint a moustache on your face. Find love. Tell it you are someone new. It will stay.

3. Wake love up in the middle of the night. Tell it the world is on fire. Dash to the bedroom window and pee out of it. Casually return to bed and assure love that everything is going to be all right. Fall asleep. Love will be there in the morning." -- Tom Robbins]]>
