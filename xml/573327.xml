	    <![CDATA["Name one hero who was happy.&quot;
I considered. Heracles went mad and killed his family; Theseus lost his bride and father; Jason's children and new wife were murdered by his old; Bellerophon killed the Chimera but was crippled by the fall from Pegasus' back.
&quot;You can't.&quot; He was sitting up now, leaning forward.
&quot;I can't.&quot;
&quot;I know. They never let you be famous AND happy.&quot; He lifted an eyebrow. &quot;I'll tell you a secret.&quot;
&quot;Tell me.&quot; I loved it when he was like this.
&quot;I'm going to be the first.&quot; He took my palm and held it to his. &quot;Swear it.&quot;
&quot;Why me?&quot;
&quot;Because you're the reason. Swear it.&quot;
&quot;I swear it,&quot; I said, lost in the high color of his cheeks, the flame in his eyes.
&quot;I swear it,&quot; he echoed.
We sat like that a moment, hands touching. He grinned.
&quot;I feel like I could eat the world raw." -- Madeline Miller]]>
