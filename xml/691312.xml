	    <![CDATA["Kent.
Where's the king?

Gent.
Contending with the fretful elements;
Bids the wind blow the earth into the sea,
Or swell the curled waters 'bove the main,
That things might change or cease; tears his white hair,
Which the impetuous blasts, with eyeless rage,
Catch in their fury and make nothing of;
Strives in his little world of man to outscorn
The to-and-fro-conflicting wind and rain.
This night, wherein the cub-drawn bear would couch,
The lion and the belly-pinched wolf
Keep their fur dry, unbonneted he runs,
And bids what will take all." -- William Shakespeare]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["To have that sense of one's intrinsic worth which constitutes self-respect is potentially to have everything: the ability to discriminate, to love and to remain indifferent.  To lack it is to be locked within oneself, paradoxically incapable of either love or indifference.  If we do not respect ourselves, we are on the one hand forced to despise those who have so few resources as to consort with us, so little perception as to remain blind to our fatal weaknesses.  On the other, we are pecularily in thrall to everyone we see, curiously determined to live out - since our self-image is untenable - their false notions of us... " -- Joan Didion]]>

	    <![CDATA["Do you think I'm wonderful?  she asked him one day as they leaned against the trunk of a petrified maple.  No, he said.  Why?  Because so many girls are wonderful.  I imagine hundreds of men have called their loves wonderful today, and it's only noon.  You couldn't be something that hundreds of others are." -- Jonathan Safran Foer]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["prepare a little hot tea or broth and it should be brought to them . . . without their being asked if they would care for it. Those who are in great distress want no food, but if it is handed to them, they will mechanically take it ' ... There was something arresting about the matter-of-fact wisdom here, the instinctive understanding of the physiological disruptions... I will not forget the instinctive wisdom of the friend who, every day for those first few weeks, brought me a quart container of scallion-and-ginger congee from Chinatown.  Congee I could eat.  Congee was all I could eat." -- Joan Didion]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["My only advantage as a reporter is that I am so physically small, so temperamentally unobtrustive, and so neurotically inarticulate that people tend to forget that my presence runs counter to their best interests.  And it always does.  That is one last thing to remember: writers are always selling somebody out." -- Joan Didion]]>
