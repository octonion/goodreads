	    <![CDATA["She thought about Penny’s stories. There was one about a man who had three wishes and married a swan. If I had three wishes, &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; know what &lt;i&gt;I’d&lt;/i&gt; wish for, thought Is. I’d wish for those two boys to be found, and for us all to be back on Blackheath Edge. She thought about Penny teaching her to read.  “What’s the point of reading?” Is had grumbled at first. “You can allus tell me stories, that’s better than reading.” “I’ll not always be here,” Penny had said shortly. “Besides, once you can read, you can learn somebody else. Folk should teach each other what they know.” “Why?” “If you don’t learn anything, you don’t grow. And someone’s gotta learn you.”

Well, thought Is, if I get outta here, I’ll be able to learn some other person the best way to get free from a rolled-up rug." -- Joan Aiken]]>
