	    <![CDATA["What I mean is, all the terrible things that happen in fairy tales seem real.  Or not real, but genuine.  Life is unfair, and the bad guys keep winning and good people die.  But I like how that's not always the end of it...Evil is real, but so is good.  They always say fairy tales are simplistic, black and white, but I don't think so.  I think they're complicated.  That's what I love about them." -- Polly Shulman]]>

	    <![CDATA["Just let me wait a little while longer,
Under your window in the quite snow.
Let me stand here and shiver, I’ll be stronger 
If I can see your light before I go.
All through the weeks I’ve tried to keep my balance.
Leaves fell, then rain, then shadows, I fell too.
Easy restraint is not among my talents,
Fall turned to Winter and I came to you.
Kissed by the snow I contemplate your face.
Oh, do not hide it in your pillow yet!
Warm rooms would never lure me from this place,
If only I could see your silhouette.
Turn on your light, my sun, my summer love.
Zero degrees down here, July above." -- Polly Shulman]]>

	    <![CDATA["We each have the innate ability to heal ourselves. To empower ourselves with natural solutions, instead of succumbing to life-altering chemicals. There's a time and place for pharmaceuticals, but it shouldn't be the first answer, nor the only form treatment." -- Dana Arcuri]]>
