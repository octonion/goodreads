		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The burning of a book is a sad, sad sight, for even though a book is nothing but ink and paper, it feels as if the ideas contained in the book are disappearing as the pages turn to ashes and the cover and binding--which is the term for the stitching and glue that holds the pages together--blacken and curl as the flames do their wicked work. When someone is burning a book, they are showing utter contempt for all of the thinking that produced its ideas, all of the labor that went into its words and sentences, and all of the trouble that befell the author . . ." -- Lemony Snicket]]>

	    <![CDATA["It is difficult for my fellow countrymen who have never lived abroad to understand that until a foreign man is about sixty-five, he still thinks, every so often, that under the right circumstances he'd like to punch an American in the face. Even people like the Chinese, who mostly like us, think of us--at least partly--as loud, fat, poorly dressed, overprivileged, hectoring, naive, arrogant, self-righteous bullies with little knowledge and no interest in any culture other than our own. I once had a conversation with a Japanese journalist who said to me, &quot;You don't seem like an American.&quot; When I asked him, slightly hurt, why he said that, he replied, &quot;Because you listen." -- Matthew Polly]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["In any case, fire burns; that's its nature, and you can't expect to change that. You can use it to cook your meat or to burn down your neighbor's house. And is the fire you use for cooking any different from the one you use for burning? And does that mean you should eat your supper raw?&quot;

Maddy shook her head, still puzzled. &quot;So what you're saying is . . . I shouldn't play with fire,&quot; she said at last.

Of course you should,&quot; said One-Eye gently. &quot;But don't be surprised if the fire plays back." -- Joanne Harris]]>

	    <![CDATA["I realized then how much alike we were. Both of us looked backwards to a beloved time that was lost to us, a time where everything had been beautiful. Both of us looked forward to some time and place that would be better. And both of us were here, now, in a grim, unhappy time where little was as we wanted it to be. We lived in our memories and in our hopes, enduring the present because we had no other choice, and because we loved the people who lived here with us." -- Susan Palwick]]>
