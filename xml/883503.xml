	    <![CDATA["I guess it's like James Joyce when he was a kid, you know. He hung out with all the great writers of the day, and he was a little kid, like, with tennis shoes on, and they said 'Look at this lame!' They didn't use those words in those days. They said 'God, here comes this nut.' And he told them, 'I'm great!' And he sat with them, and he loved to be with them, and it ended up that he &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; great." -- Art Pepper]]>

Notwithstanding this eulogy, I soon found that the mass of plain porter bears an unsatisfactory relation to its toxic content and I subsequently became addicted to brown stout in bottle, a drink which still remains the one that I prefer the most despite the painful and blinding fits of vomiting which a plurality of bottles has often induced in me." -- Flann O'Brien]]>

	    <![CDATA["He told me that in 1886 he had invented an original system of numbering and that in a very few days he had gone beyond the twenty-four-thousand mark. He had not written it down, since anything he thought of once would never be lost to him. His first stimulus was, I think, his discomfort at the fact that the famous thirty-three gauchos of Uruguayan history should require two signs and two words, in place of a single word and a single sign. He then applied this absurd principle to the other numbers. In place of seven thousand thirteen he would say (for example) &lt;i&gt;Maximo Pérez&lt;/i&gt;; in place of seven thousand fourteen, &lt;i&gt;The Railroad&lt;/i&gt;; other numbers were &lt;i&gt;Luis Melián Lafinur&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Olimar&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;sulphur&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;the reins&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;the whale&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;the gas&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;the caldron&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Napoleon&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Agustin de Vedia&lt;/i&gt;. In place of five hundred, he would say &lt;i&gt;nine&lt;/i&gt;. Each word had a particular sign, a kind of mark; the last in the series were very complicated..." -- Jorge Luis Borges]]>

Common sense is the Monday morning quarterback who could have won the ball game if he had been on the team. But he never is. He's high up in the stands with a flask on his hip. Common sense is the little man in a grey suit who never makes a mistake in addition. But it's always someone else's money he's adding up." -- Raymond Chandler]]>
