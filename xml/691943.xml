		<description>
	    <![CDATA["No live organism can continue for long to exist sanely under conditions of absolute reality; even larks and katydids are supposed, by some, to dream. Hill House, not sane, stood by itself against its hills, holding darkness within; it had stood so for eighty years and might stand for eighty more. Within, walls continued upright, bricks met neatly, floors were firm, and doors were sensibly shut; silence lay steadily against the wood and stone of Hill House, and whatever walked there, walked alone." -- Shirley Jackson]]>

	    <![CDATA["I want to stay,&quot; and then, more weakly, &quot;Need some more sun.&quot;

A fly from a batch of seaweed lands on a white, bony thigh. She doesn't slap at it. It doesn't go away.

&quot;But there's no sun, dude.&quot; I tell her.

I start to walk away. So what, I mutter under my breath. When she wants to come in, she will. Imagine a blind person dreaming. I head back up toward the house. Wonder if Griffin will stick around, if Mona made reservations for dinner, if Spin will call back. &quot;I know what the word dead means,&quot; I whisper to myself as softly as I can because it sounds like an omen." -- Bret Easton Ellis]]>
