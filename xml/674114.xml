		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The sad engineer would never go back to England; he would become one of these elderly expatriates who hide out in remote countries, with odd sympathies, a weakness for the local religion, an unreasonable anger, and the kind of total recall that drives curious strangers away.

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I climbed a path and from the top looked up-stream towards Chile. I could see the river, glinting and sliding through the bone-white cliffs with strips of emerald cultivation either side. Away from the cliffs was the desert. There was no sound but the wind, whirring through thorns and whistling through dead grass, and no other sign of life but a hawk, and a black beetle easing over white stones." -- Bruce Chatwin]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["As a general rule of biology, migratory species are less 'aggressive' than sedentary ones.

There is one obvious reason why this should be so.  The migration itself, like the pilgrimage, is the hard journey: a 'leveller' on which the 'fit' survive and stragglers fall by the wayside.

The journey thus pre-empts the need for hierarchies and shows of dominance.  The 'dictators' of the animal kingdom are those who live in an ambience of plenty.  The anarchists, as always, are the 'gentlemen of the road'." -- Bruce Chatwin]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["In keeping silent about evil, in burying it so deep within us that no sign of it appears on the surface, we are implanting it, and it will rise up a thousand fold in the future. When we neither punish nor reproach evildoers, we are not simply protecting their trivial old age, we are thereby ripping the foundations of justice from beneath new generations." -- Aleksandr I. Solzhenitsyn]]>
