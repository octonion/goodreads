	    <![CDATA["But perhaps more important, as someone wishing to make a comment or two about contemporary life and values, I don't have to dig through libraries or travel to exotic lands to arrive at a view of our modern situation refracted through the lens of the preindustrial world, or the uncommercialized, unfranchised, perhaps unsanitized-and therefore supposedly more &quot;authentic&quot;-perspective ofthe Third World. Very simply, this is because that &quot;other&quot; world, as alien as if separated by centuries in time, is the one from which I came" -- Sidney Poitier]]>

	    <![CDATA["As I entered this world, I would leave behind the nurturing of my family and my home, but in another sense I would take their protection with me. The lessons I had learned, the feelings of groundedness and belonging that have been woven into my character there, would be my companions on the journey." -- Sidney Poitier]]>
