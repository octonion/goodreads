	    <![CDATA["You will be required to do wrong no matter where you go. It is the basic condition of life, to be required to violate your own identity. At some time, every creature which lives must do so. It is the ultimate shadow, the defeat of creation; this is the curse at work, the curse that feeds on all life. Everywhere in the universe." -- Philip K. Dick]]>

	    <![CDATA["I hate a Roman named Status Quo!&quot; he said to me. &quot;Stuff your eyes with wonder,&quot; he said, &quot;live as if you'd drop dead in ten seconds. See the world. It's more fantastic than any dream made or paid for in factories. Ask no guarantees, ask for no security, there never was such an animal. And if there were, it would be related to the great sloth which hangs upside down in a tree all day every day, sleeping its life away. To hell with that,&quot; he said, &quot;shake the tree and knock the great sloth down on his ass." -- Ray Bradbury]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["And make no mistake: irony tyrannizes us. The reason why our pervasive cultural irony is at once so powerful and so unsatisfying is that an ironist is impossible to pin down. All U.S. irony is based on an implicit &quot;I don’t really mean what I’m saying.&quot; So what does irony as a cultural norm mean to say? That it’s impossible to mean what you say? That maybe it’s too bad it’s impossible, but wake up and smell the coffee already? Most likely, I think, today’s irony ends up saying: &quot;How totally banal of you to ask what I really mean." -- David Foster Wallace]]>
