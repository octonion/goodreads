	    <![CDATA["Today, with the abundance of books available, it is the mark of a truly educated man to know what not to read. … Feed only on the best. As John Wesley’s mother counseled him: ‘Avoid whatever weakens your reason, impairs the tenderness of your conscience, obscures your sense of God, takes off your relish for spiritual things, … increases the authority of the body over the mind." -- Ezra Taft Benson]]>

	    <![CDATA["And your will shall decide your destiny,&quot; he said: &quot;I offer you my hand, my heart, and a share of all my possessions.&quot; 

You play a farce, which I merely laugh at.&quot; 

I ask you to pass through life at my side--to be my second self, and best earthly companion.&quot; 

For that fate you have already made your choice, and must abide by it.&quot; 

Jane, be still a few moments: you are over-excited: I will be still too.&quot; 

A waft of wind came sweeping down the laurel-walk, and trembled through the boughs of the chestnut: it wandered away--away--to an indefinite distance--it died. The nightingale's song was then the only voice of the hour: in listening to it, I again wept. Mr. Rochester sat quiet, looking at me gently and seriously. Some time passed before he spoke; he at last said - 

Come to my side, Jane, and let us explain and understand one another.&quot; 

I will never again come to your side: I am torn away now, and cannot return.&quot; 

But, Jane, I summon you as my wife: it is you only I intend to marry.&quot; 

I was silent: I thought he mocked me. 

Come, Jane--come hither.&quot; 

Your bride stands between us.&quot; 

He rose, and with a stride reached me. 

My bride is here,&quot; he said, again drawing me to him, &quot;because my equal is here, and my likeness. Jane, will you marry me?" -- Charlotte Brontë]]>
