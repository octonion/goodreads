'Inessential penises?' Karou had repeated, delighted with the phrase in spite of her grief. 'Is there any such thing as an essential one?'

'When an essential one comes along, you'll know,' he'd replied." -- Laini Taylor]]>

That this foul deed shall smell above the earth
With carrion men, groaning for burial." -- William Shakespeare]]>
