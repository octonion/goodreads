	    <![CDATA["Black Rabbit: Hazel... Hazel... you know me, don't you? 
Hazel: I don't know. 
[the apparition reveals himself to be the Black Rabbit, and Hazel gasps] 
Hazel: Yes, my lord. I know you. 
Black Rabbit: I've come to ask if you'd like to join my Owsla. We shall be glad to have you, and I know you'd like it. You've been feeling tired, haven't you? If you're ready, we might go along now. 
[Hazel looks at all the younger rabbits of Watership Down] 
Black Rabbit: You needn't worry about them. They'll be all right, and thousands like them. If you come along now, I'll show you what I mean." -- Richard Adams]]>

But first they must catch you, digger, listener, runner, prince with the swift warning. Be cunning and full of tricks and your people shall never be destroyed." -- Richard Adams]]>
