	    <![CDATA["David Bell is a natural storyteller and a superb writer. THE FORGOTTEN GIRL is a mystery lover’s mystery; a quick-paced and intriguing tale of what happens when the past catches up with the present. Mr. Bell understands the hearts and minds of ordinary and not so ordinary people, and his keen insights add a powerful dimension to his crisp writing.”
—Nelson DeMille, #1 New York Times bestselling author 

&quot;David Bell writes spellbinding and gripping thrillers that get under your skin and refuse to let go. This is his best so far.&quot;
—Linwood Barclay, New York Times and #1 international bestselling author
 
&quot;David Bell’s THE FORGOTTEN GIRL is both a tightly-woven mystery and a frightening look at addiction, the mistrust it creates, the power of secrets, and the hurt created by the little lies we tell ourselves. I never felt like I had my feet under me. Bell has crafted an unforgettable story full of surprises. Don’t miss it.&quot;
—JT Ellison, New York Times bestselling author" -- David J.    Bell]]>
