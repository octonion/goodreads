	    <![CDATA["The feeling of total emptiness is no longer there. Money can buy you everything but happiness. It can pay your fare to everywhere but heaven. That's what I found out. I also found out if you seek pleasure and happiness you'll never find it. But if you have the wisdom and obedience to seek Jesus Christ, happiness will find you." -- &quot;Pistol&quot; Pete Maravitch]]>

	    <![CDATA["I fervently believed that an athlete, or any young person in general, should have his long-range goals in life planned by the eighth or ninth grade. Though few children considered the next month in advance, I constantly challenged the students in my basketball clinics to start making plans for their futures and stop wasting time.
