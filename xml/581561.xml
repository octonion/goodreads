		<description>
	    <![CDATA["How is it that one day life is orderly and you are content, a little cynical perhaps but on the whole just so, and then without warning you find the solid floor is a trapdor and you are now in another place whose geography is uncertain and whose customs are strange?
Travellers at least have a chose.  Those who set sail know know that things will not be the same as at home.  Explorers are perpared.  But for us, who travel to cities of the interior by chance, there is no preparaton.  We who are fluent find liffe is a foreign language.  Somewhere beween the swamp and the mountains.  Somewhere beween fear and sex.  Somewere beween God and the Devil passion is and the way there is sudden and the way back worse." -- Jeanette Winterson]]>

	    <![CDATA["The major problem&amp;mdash;&lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt; of the major problems, for there are several&amp;mdash;one of the many major problems with governing people is that of whom you get to do it; or rather of who manages to get people to let them do it to them. 
To summarize: it is a well-known fact that those people who must &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; to rule people are, ipso facto, those least suited to do it. 
To summarize the summary: anyone who is capable of getting themselves made President should on no account be allowed to do the job." -- Douglas Adams]]>
