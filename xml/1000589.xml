	    <![CDATA["In the beginning, God created the earth, and he looked upon it in his cosmic loneliness.

And God said, &quot;Let Us make living creatures out of mud, so the mud can see what We have done.&quot; And God created every living creature that now moveth, and one was man. Mud as man alone could speak. God leaned close to mud as man sat, looked around, and spoke. &quot;What is the purpose of all this?&quot; he asked politely.

&quot;Everything must have a purpose?&quot; asked God.

&quot;Certainly,&quot; said man.

&quot;Then I leave it to you to think of one for all this,&quot; said God.

And He went away." -- Kurt Vonnegut]]>

	    <![CDATA["The Road Not Taken

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both	
And be one traveler, long I stood	
And looked down one as far as I could	
To where it bent in the undergrowth;	        
 
Then took the other, as just as fair,	
And having perhaps the better claim,	
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;	
Though as for that the passing there	
Had worn them really about the same,	        
 
And both that morning equally lay	
In leaves no step had trodden black.	
Oh, I kept the first for another day!	
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,	
I doubted if I should ever come back.	        
 
I shall be telling this with a sigh	
Somewhere ages and ages hence:	
Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”	
I took the one less traveled by,	
And that has made all the difference." -- Robert Frost]]>

	    <![CDATA["I will not play at tug o' war.
I'd rather play at hug o' war,
Where everyone hugs
Instead of tugs,
Where everyone giggles
And rolls on the rug,
Where everyone kisses,
And everyone grins,
And everyone cuddles,
And everyone wins." -- Shel Silverstein]]>
