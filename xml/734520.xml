	    <![CDATA["I know no safe depository of the ultimate powers of the society but the people themselves ;  and if we think them not enlightened enough to exercise their control with a wholesome discretion, the remedy is not to take it from them, but to inform their discretion by education.  This is the true corrective of abuses of constitutional power." -- Thomas Jefferson]]>

	    <![CDATA["When the clergy addressed [author:General Washington|4356] on his departure from the government, it was observed in their consultation that he had never on any occasion said a word to the public which showed a belief in the Christian religion and they thought they should so pen their address as to force him at length to declare publicly whether he was a Christian or not. They did so. However [Dr. Rush] observed the old fox was too cunning for them. He answered every article of their address particularly except that, which he passed over without notice... I know that [author:Gouverneur Morris|945122], who pretended to be in his secrets &amp; believed himself to be so, has often told me that &lt;b&gt;[author:General Washington|4356] believed no more of that system than he himself did&lt;/b&gt;.

{&lt;i&gt;The Anas, February 1, 1800, written shortly after the death of first US president [author:George Washington|4356]&lt;/i&gt;}" -- Thomas Jefferson]]>
