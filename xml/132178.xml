	    <![CDATA["Losing you is most difficult for me, but the nature of my love for you is what matters. If it distorts into half-truth, then perhaps it is better not to love you. I must keep my mind but loose you." -- Haruki Murakami]]>

	    <![CDATA["Boys and girls in America have such a sad time together; sophistication demands that they submit to sex immediately without proper preliminary talk. Not courting talk â€” real straight talk about souls, for life is holy and every moment is precious." -- Jack Kerouac]]>

	    <![CDATA["What do you want out of life?&quot; I asked, and I used to ask that all the time of girls.
I don't know,&quot; she said. &quot;Just wait on tables and try to get along.&quot; She yawned. I put my hand over her mouth and told her not to yawn. I tried to tell her how excited I was about life and the things we could do together; saying that, and planning to leave Denver in two days. She turned away wearily. We lay on our backs, looking at the ceiling and wondering what God had wrought when He made life so sad." -- Jack Kerouac]]>
