		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The patron gets comfortable in bed and opens up the book -- it opens tentatively -- and the patron bends the open book backward until there is a satisfying crack and the book is a little more supple, a little easier to read.  The book spine has just been broken, and a broken spine means a more submissive book." -- Don Borchert]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The library knows that it is a temporary fix.  We have a stamp for the inside front cover: BROKEN SPINE NOTED.  It is like a bracelet worn by a diabetic.  When you return the book with this message stamped inside, we know you're not the one responsible for this horrible thing.  It was some other bastard before you.  The book has a preexisting condition." -- Don Borchert]]>

	    <![CDATA["I do not understand people who will lustily throw $40,000 at the shiny red automobile of their choice, but well up with tears and become outraged when they are asked to pay $5 for a damaged videotape. Either they are fucked up and their priorities are fucked up or I am fucked up and my priorities are fucked up. Because I am me, I think it is them." -- Don Borchert]]>
