	    <![CDATA["...the secret of the Great Stories is that they &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; no secrets. The Great Stories are the ones you have heard and want to hear again. The ones you can enter anywhere and inhabit comfortably. They don’t deceive you with thrills and trick endings. They don’t surprise you with the unforeseen. They are as familiar as the house you live in. Or the smell of your lover’s skin. You know how they end, yet you listen as though you don’t. In the way that although you know that one day you will die, you live as though you won’t. In the Great Stories you know who lives, who dies, who finds love, who doesn’t. And yet you want to know again.

&lt;i&gt;That&lt;/i&gt; is their mystery and their magic." -- Arundhati Roy]]>

	    <![CDATA["As she watched him she understood the quality of his beauty.  How his labor had shaped him.  How the wood he fashioned had fashioned him.  Each plank he planed, each nail he drove, each thing he made molded him.  Had left its stamp on him.  Had given him his strength, his supple grace." -- Arundhati Roy]]>
