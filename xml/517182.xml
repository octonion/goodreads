	    <![CDATA["First, I'm going to give you all the Copperfield crap, and I'm not going to apologize for any of it, not one paragraph, so if you're not interested in how I came to see the future, or how I came to understand that the biggest truth in my life was a lie, or, for that matter, how I parlayed my distaste for hot dogs into an '84 RX-7 and a new self-concept, do us both a favor, and just stop now." -- Jonathan Evison]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["We are born haunted, he said, his voice weak, but still clear. Haunted by our fathers and mothers and daughters, and by people we don't remember.  We are haunted by otherness, by the path not taken, by the life unlived.  We are haunted by the changing winds and the ebbing tides of history.  And even as our own flame burns brightest, we are haunted by the embers of the first dying fire.  But mostly, said Lord Jim, we are haunted by ourselves." -- Jonathan Evison]]>
