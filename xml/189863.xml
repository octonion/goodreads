	    <![CDATA["Maybe that's what it all comes down to. Love, not as a surge of passion, but as a choice to commit to something, someone, no matter what obstacles or temptations stand in the way. And maybe making that choice, again and again, day in and day out, year after year, says more about love than never having a choice to make at all." -- Emily Giffin]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["For once, he slept first. She lay in the dark, listening to him breathe, stealing a little of his warmth as her own body cooled. Since he was asleep, she stroked his hair.

&quot;I love you,&quot; she murmured. &quot;I love you so much, I'm stupid about it.&quot;

With a sigh, she settled down, closed her eyes, and willed her mind to empty.
Beside her, Roarke smiled into the dark.

He never slept first." -- J.D. Robb]]>
