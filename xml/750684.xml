		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The reason this system can’t be overthrown in this country,” Walter said, “is all about freedom. The reason the free market in Europe is tempered by socialism is that they’re not so hung up on personal liberties there. They also have lower population growth rates, despite comparable income levels. The Europans are all-around more rational, basically. And the conversation about rights in this country isn’t rational. It’s taking place on the level of emotion, and class resentments, which is why the right is so good at exploiting it." -- Jonathan Franzen]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["It’s all circling around the same problem of personal liberties,” Walter said. “People came to this country for either money or freedom. If you don’t have money, you cling to your freedoms all the more angrily. Even if smoking kills you, even if you can’t afford to feed your kids, even if your kids are getting shot down by maniacs with assault rifles. You may be poor, but the one thing nobody can take away from you is the freedom to fuck up your life whatever way you want to." -- Jonathan Franzen]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["--he could feel the outside world closing in on him, demanding his consideration, but as long as he stayed by himself in the woods he was able to remain true to his refusal. He came from a long line of refusers, he had the constitution for it. There seemed to be almost nothing left of Lalitha; she was breaking up on him the way dead songbirds did in the wild--they were impossibly light to begin with, and as soon as their little hearts stopped beating they were barely more than bits of fluff and hollow bone, easily scattered in the wind--but this only made him more determined to hold on to what little of her he still had." -- Jonathan Franzen]]>

	    <![CDATA["Remind me again what's wrong with Dave Matthews?&quot;
&quot;Basically everything, except technical proficiency,&quot; Walter said.
&quot;Right.&quot;
&quot;But maybe especially the banality of the lyrics. 'Gotta be free, so free, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Can't live without my freedom, yeah yeah.' That's pretty much every song." -- Jonathan Franzen]]>
