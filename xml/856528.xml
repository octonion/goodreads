And the selfsame well from which your laughter rises was oftentimes filled with your tears.
And how else can it be?
The deeper that sorrow carves into your being, the more joy you can contain." -- Khalil Gibran]]>

	    <![CDATA["Writer's Resolution
Enough's Enough! No more shall I
Pursue the Muse and scorch the pie
Or dream of Authoring a book
When I (unhappy soul) must cook;
Or burn the steak while I wool-gather,
And stir my spouse into a lather
Invoking words like &quot;Darn!&quot; and such
And others that are worse (Oh, much!)
Concerning culinary knack
Which I (HE says) completely lack.
I'll keep my mind upon my work;
I'll learn each boresome cooking quirk;
This day shall mark a new leaf's turning...
That smell! Oh Hell! The beans are burning!" -- Terry Ryan]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do." -- Apple Computer Inc.]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["And here, after all that, is what I have come to believe about beauty:  Laughter is beautiful.  Kindness is beautiful.  Cellulite is beautiful.  Softness and plumpness and roundness are beautiful.  It’s more important to be interesting, to be vivid, and to be adventurous than to sit pretty for pictures.  The soft tummy of a woman is a miracle of nature.  Beauty comes from tenderness.  Beauty comes from variety, from specificity, from the fact that no person in the world looks exactly like anyone else.  Beauty comes from the tragedy that each person’s life is destined to be lost to time.  I believe women are too hard on themselves.  I believe that when you love someone, she becomes beautiful to you.  I believe the eyes see everything through the heart, that nothing in the world feels as good as resting them on someone you love.  I have trained my eyes to look for beauty, and I’ve gotten very good at finding it.  You can argue and tell me it’s not true, but I really don’t care what anyone says.  I have come at last to believe in the title of the book: Everyone Is Beautiful." -- Katherine Center]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Remember!--It is Christianity to do good always--even to those who do evil to us.  It is Christianity to love our neighbours as ourself, and to do to all men as we would have them do to us.  It is Christianity to be gentle, merciful and forgiving, and to keep those qualities quiet in our own hearts, and never make a boast of them or of our prayers or of our love of God, but always to show that we love Him by humbly trying to do right in everything.  If we do this, and remember the life and lessons of Our Lord Jesus Christ, and try to act up to them, we may confidently hope that God will forgive us our sins and mistakes, and enable us to live and die in peace." -- Charles Dickens]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Live each day as if it's your last', that was the conventional advice, but really, who had the energy for that?  What if it rained or you felt a bit glandy?  It just wasn't practical.  Better by far to simply try and be good and courageous and bold and to make a difference.  Not change the world exactly, but the bit around you.  Go out there with your passion and your electric typewriter and work hard at...something.  Change lives through art maybe.  Cherish your friends, stay true to your principles, live passionately and fully and well.  Experience new things.  Love and be loved, if you ever get the chance." -- David Nicholls]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Father, where shall I work today?&quot;
And my love flowed warm and free.
Then He pointed out a tiny spot
And said, &quot;Tend that for me.&quot;
I answered quickly, &quot;Oh no, not that!
Why, no one would ever see,
No matter how well my work was done.
Not that little place for me.&quot;
And the word He spoke, it was not stern;
He answered me tenderly:
&quot;Ah, little one, search that heart of thine;
Art thou working for them or me?
Nazareth was a little place,
And so was Galilee." -- Meade McGuire as Quoted by Thomas S. Monson as quoted by Heidi Swinton]]>
