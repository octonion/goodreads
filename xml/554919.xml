		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Some mornings you wake up fully in your body, and you know this is all there is--the air, the shape your body makes in the air, your hand, the skin that covers your hand, the air that covers your skin, the light that fills the air, a few colors in the light, this one thought, this dream dissolving--it is a dream that, in your half-awake state, embarrasses you. You don't tell it to the woman waking up beside you, the woman you love, because it is about another woman, whom you might also love. This is the dream you need to hold onto, this is your shadow speaking, attempting to bewilder you again. Sometimes, if you lay still, you can feel the air entering each cell, sometimes you can feel the blood in your lips. Sometimes, if you lay very still, you can feel the whole web tremble." -- Nick Flynn]]>

	    <![CDATA["Abby began to think that all the beauty and ugliness and turbulence one found scattered through nature, one could also find in people themselves, all collected there, all together in a single place. No matter what terror or loveliness the earth could produce- wind, seas- a person could produce the same, lived with the same, lived with all that mixed-up nature swirling inside, every bit. There was nothing as complex in the world- no flower or stone- as a single hello from a human being." -- Lorrie Moore]]>

She's refilled each day with fresh tides of longing." -- Jeanette Winterson]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The assimilation of taboo images to the everyday language of doing business produces a strange effect.  It domesticates the taboo while at the same time making the everyday transactional world more porous, more open to the forbidden.  The wolf of unbridled appetite slips into everyday convention in the sheep's clothing of commercial language." -- Lee Siegel]]>

	    <![CDATA["The question occurred to me: Well, if that's so, if the Divine is ultimately formless and genderless, what's the big deal? Why all this bother?
The bother is because we have no other way of speaking about the Absolute. We need forms and images. Without them we have no way of relating to the Divine.  Symbol and image create a universal spiritual language. It's the language the soul understands." -- Sue Monk Kidd]]>

	    <![CDATA["The second thing I wrote down that day was that exclusive male imagery of the Divine not only instilled an imbalance within human consciousness, it legitimized patriarchal power in the culture at large. Here alone is enough reason to recover the Divine Feminine, for there is a real and undeniable connection between the repression of the feminine in our deity and the repression of women." -- Sue Monk Kidd]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The core symbols we use for God represent what we take to be the highest good....These symbols or images shape our worldview, our ethical system, and our social practice--how we relate to one another.
For instance, [Elizabeth A.] Johnson suggests that if a religion speaks about God as warrior, using militaristic language such as how &quot;he crushes his enemies&quot; and summoning people to become soldiers in God's army, then the people tend to become militaristic and aggressive.
Likewise, if the &lt;i&gt;key&lt;/i&gt; symbol of God is that of a male king (without any balancing feminine imagery), we become a culture that values and enthrones men and masculinity." -- Sue Monk Kidd]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The truth is, in order to heal we need to tell our stories and have them witnessed...The story itself becomes a vessel that holds us up, that sustains, that allows us to order our jumbled experiences into meaning.
As I told my stories of fear, awakening, struggle, and transformation and had them received, heard, and validated by other women, I found healing.
I also needed to hear other women's stories in order to see and embrace my own. Sometimes another woman's story becomes a mirror that shows me a self I haven't seen before. When I listen to her tell it, her experience quickens and clarifies my own. Her questions rouse mine. Her conflicts illumine my conflicts. Her resolutions call forth my hope. Her strengths summon my strengths. All of this can happen even when our stories and our lives are very different." -- Sue Monk Kidd]]>
