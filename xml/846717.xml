He glanced back down at the pencil in his hand and then turned to the table. Flipping the spiral notebook to a new page, he bent way over and labored on top of the paper for quite a while. Then he ripped the sheet free.

His hand was shaking as he held it out. &quot;It's messy.&quot;

Bella took the paper. In a child's uneven block letters there were three words: I LOVE YOU

Her lips flattened tight as her eyes stung. The handwriting got wavy and then disappeared.
 
&quot;Maybe you can't read it,&quot; he said in a small voice. &quot;I can do it over.&quot;
 
She shook her head. &quot;I can read it just fine. It's… beautiful.&quot;

&quot;I don't expect anything back. I mean… I know that you don't… feel that for me anymore. But I wanted you to know. It's important that you knew." -- J.R. Ward]]>
