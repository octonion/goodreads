	    <![CDATA["Jared?” His fingers were playing gently in my curls. 
“Yes?” I was more than halfway asleep, perfectly warm and content, back in my own bed. With him. 
“Say it for me.” 
“You’re heavy.” 
“No.” 
“You’re a manipulative bastard.” 
“No.” He was laughing. 
“You’re right.” 
He gave one hard tug on my hair. “That’s not it either.” 
“I love you?” 
He sighed contentedly. “That’s the one." -- Marie Sexton]]>

	    <![CDATA["I'm a mess,&quot; he said, halfway joking but halfway not. &quot;I'm demanding and temperamental and I'm terribly high maintenance.&quot;

I laughed without even meaning to. &quot;Do you honestly think I don't know all that by now?&quot;

&quot;Then how could you possibly love me?&quot;

I held him tighter, kept kissing his neck. &quot;How can I not?" -- Marie Sexton]]>
