	    <![CDATA["Ordinarily my mom just sunk deeper into her corner of the couch and ignored it.  She had succesfully ignored a quarter of a century of entropy and decay, had sat peacefully crunching popcorn and drinking soda while the house fell down around us.

	    <![CDATA["They did a lot of cleaning in their house, which I considered to be a sign of immoral parenting.
