	    <![CDATA["Because this is what happens when you try to run from the past. it doesn't just catch up: it overtakes, blotting out the future, the landscape, the very sky, until there is no path left except that which leads through it, the only one that can ever get you home." -- Sarah Dessen]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Being nice was the ideal, the one place where people didn't get loud, or so quiet they could scare you. If you could just be nice, then you wouldn't have to worry about arguments at all. But being nice wasn't as easy as it seemed, especially when the rest of the world could be so mean." -- Sarah Dessen]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["This is the problem with dealing with someone who is actually a good listener. They donâ€™t jump in on your sentences, saving you from actually finishing them, or talk over you, allowing what you do manage to get out to be lost or altered in transit. Instead, they wait, so you have to keep going." -- Sarah Dessen]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The belief that unhappiness is selfless and happiness is selfish is misguided.  It's more selfless to act happy.  It takes energy, generosity, and discipline to be unfailingly lighthearted, yet everyone takes the happy person for granted.  No one is careful of his feelings or tries to keep his spirits high. He seems self-sufficient; he becomes a cushion for others.  And because happiness seems unforced, that person usually gets no credit." -- Gretchen Rubin]]>
