		<description>
	    <![CDATA["When you're in a relationship with someone who's selfish, what keeps you in it is the fact that when they shine on you, it's this souped-up shine. And you feel like you're in the club. And you don't even know what club it is. You just know you want to stay in it." -- Mike Birbiglia]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Until a man is twenty-five, he still thinks, every so often, that under the right circumstances he could be the baddest motherfucker in the world. If I moved to a martial-arts monastery in China and studied real hard for ten years. If my family was wiped out by Colombian drug dealers and I swore myself to revenge. If I got a fatal disease, had one year to live, and devoted it to wiping out street crime. If I just dropped out and devoted my life to being bad." -- Neal Stephenson]]>

	    <![CDATA["You have responsibilities, now, Bob. You must lose this naive understanding of violence! You are embarrassin' me in front of the lads! You can't play by their rules or they'll win unfailingly! You don't engage in courtly play-fightin' with one such as this. You get a great friggin' tree-branch and keep hittin' him with it until he dies." -- Neal Stephenson]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["After all, we were young.  We were fourteen and fifteen, scornful of childhood, remote from the world of stern and ludicrous adults.  We were bored, we were restless, we longed to be seized by any whim or passion and follow it to the farthest reaches of our natures.  We wanted to live – to die – to burst into flame – to be transformed into angels or explosions.  Only the mundane offended us, as if we secretly feared it was our destiny .  By late afternoon our muscles ached, our eyelids grew heavy with obscure desires.  And so we dreamed and did nothing, for what was there to do, played ping-pong and went to the beach, loafed in backyards, slept late into the morning – and always we craved adventures so extreme we could never imagine them.  In the long dusks of summer we walked the suburban streets through scents of maple and cut grass, waiting for something to happen." -- Steven Millhauser]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["It didn't matter in the end how old they had been, or that they were girls, but only that we had loved them, and that they hadn't heard us calling, still do not hear us, up here in the tree house, with our thinning hair and soft bellies, calling them out of those rooms where they went to be alone for all time, alone in suicide, which is deeper than death, and where we will never find the pieces to put them back together." -- Jeffrey Eugenides]]>

	    <![CDATA["There is a cult of ignorance in the United States, and there has always been. The strain of anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that  democracy means that 'my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge." -- Issac Asimov ]]>
