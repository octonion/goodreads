	    <![CDATA["Most of us, in our civilized society, rely too heavily on reasoning capacity to make things happen.  We've been raised to believe that logic will prevail.  Logic, in and of itself, will rarely influence people.  Most often logic doesn't work." -- Herb Cohen]]>

	    <![CDATA["No' is a reaction, not a position. The people who react negatively to your proposal simply need time to evaluate it and adjust their thinking. With the passage of sufficient time and repeated efforts on your part, almost every 'no' can be transformed into a 'maybe' and eventually a 'yes'." -- Herb Cohen]]>

Prized far beyond the rest;
For Ravenclaw, the cleverest
Would always be the best;
For Hufflepuff, hard workers were
Most worthy of admission;
And power-hungry Slytherin
Loved those of great ambition." -- J.K. Rowling]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["When a child first catches adults out -- when it first walks into his grave little head that adults do not always have divine intelligence, that their judgments are not always wise, their thinking true, their sentences just -- his world falls into panic desolation. The gods are fallen and all safety gone. And there is one sure thing about the fall of gods: they do not fall a little; they crash and shatter or sink deeply into green muck. It is a tedious job to build them up again; they never quite shine. And the child's world is never quite whole again. It is an aching kind of growing." -- John Steinbeck]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["A man who tells secrets or stories must think of who is hearing or reading, for a story has as many versions as it has readers. Everyone takes what he wants or can from it and thus changes it to his measure. Some pick out parts and reject the rest, some strain the story through their mesh of prejudice, some paint it with their own delight. A story must have some points of contact with the reader to make him feel at home in it. Only then can he accept wonders." -- John Steinbeck]]>

Have you ever noticed that chickens are roughly egg-shaped?" -- John Steinbeck]]>

	    <![CDATA["We look for medicine to be an orderly field of knowledge and procedure.  But it is not.  It is an imperfect science, an enterprise of constantly changing knowledge, uncertain information, fallible individuals, and at the same time lives on the line.  There is science in what we do, yes, but also habit, intuition, and sometimes plain old guessing.  The gap between what we know and what we aim for persists.  And this gap complicates everything we do." -- Atul Gawande]]>
