	    <![CDATA["Nature's first green is gold,
Her hardest hue to hold.
Her early leaf's a flower;
But only so an hour.
Then leaf subsides to leaf.
So Eden sank to grief,
So dawn goes down to day.
Nothing gold can stay." -- Robert Frost]]>

	    <![CDATA["To the Virgins, To Make much of Time


Gather ye rose-buds while ye may,
Old Time is still a-flying;
And this same flower that smiles today,
	Tomorrow will be dying.

The glorious lamp of heaven, the sun,
	The higher he’s a-getting,
The sooner will his race be run,
	And nearer he is to setting.

That age is best which is the first,
	When youth and blood are warmer;
But being spent, the worse, and worst
	Times still succeed the former.

Then be not coy, but use your time,
	And while you may, go marry;
For having lost but once your prime,
	You may for ever tarry." -- Robert  Herrick]]>

	    <![CDATA["The Road Not Taken

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both	
And be one traveler, long I stood	
And looked down one as far as I could	
To where it bent in the undergrowth;	        
 
Then took the other, as just as fair,	
And having perhaps the better claim,	
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;	
Though as for that the passing there	
Had worn them really about the same,	        
 
And both that morning equally lay	
In leaves no step had trodden black.	
Oh, I kept the first for another day!	
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,	
I doubted if I should ever come back.	        
 
I shall be telling this with a sigh	
Somewhere ages and ages hence:	
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—	
I took the one less traveled by,	
And that has made all the difference." -- Robert Frost]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["When I confront a human being as my Thou and speak the basic word I-Thou to him, then he is no thing among things nor does he consist of things. He is no longer He or She, a dot in the world grid of space and time, nor a condition to be experienced and described, a loose bundle of named qualities. Neighborless and seamless, he is Thou and fills the firmament. Not as if there were nothing but he; but everything else lives in his light." -- Martin Buber]]>

	    <![CDATA["Life's a forge!  Yes, and hammer and anvil, too!  You'll be roasted, smelted, and pounded, and you'll scarce know what's happening to you.  But stand boldly to it!  Metal's worthless till it's shaped and tempered!  More labor than luck.  Face the pounding, don't fear the proving; and you'll stand well against any hammer and anvil." -- Lloyd Alexander]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, 'Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous?' Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It's not just in some of us; it's in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others." -- Marianne Williamson]]>

	    <![CDATA["Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?&quot;
&quot;That depends a good deal on where you want to get to.&quot;
&quot;I don't much care where –&quot;
&quot;Then it doesn't matter which way you go." -- Lewis Carroll]]>
