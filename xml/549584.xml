		<description>
	    <![CDATA["And let’s face it people, no one is ever honest with you about child birth.  Not even your mother.       “It’s a pain you forget all about once you have that sweet little baby in your arms.”     Bullshit.   I CALL BULLSHIT.   Any friend, cousin, or nosey-ass stranger in the grocery store that tells you it’s not that bad is a lying sack of shit.   Your vagina is roughly the size of the girth of a penis.   It has to stretch and open andturn into a giant bat cave so the life-sucking human you’ve been growing for nine months can angrily claw its way out.   Who in their right mind would do that willingly?   You’re just walking along one day and think to yourself, “You know, I think it’s time I turn my vagina into an Arby’s Beef and Cheddar (minus the cheddar) and saddle myself down for a minimum of eighteen years to someone who will suck the soul and the will to live right out of my body so I’m a shell of the person I used to be and can’t get laid even if I pay for it." -- Tara Sivec]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["A long time ago, the act of another put the dark in his veins, and it's been there ever since. The night he lost his true love, his heart and his brain became one, so that his heart was scheming and his brain was loving. 'That doesn't sound so bad', my dream-self thought, but suddenly I could feel it, and it was very bad indeed—for when a brain loves, it is only out of obsession, and when a heart schemes, it does not mean well." -- Beck Sherman]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["He had heard about talking to plants in the early seventies, on Radio Four, and thought it was an excellent idea.  Although talking is perhaps the wrong word for what Crowley did.
    What he did was put the fear of God into them.
    More precisely, the fear of Crowley.
    In addition to which, every couple of months Crowley would pick out a plant that was growing too slowly, or succumbing to leaf-wilt or browning, or just didn't look quite as good as the others, and he would carry it around to all the other plants. &quot;Say goodbye to your friend,&quot; he'd say to them. &quot;He just couldn't cut it. . . &quot;
    Then he would leave the flat with the offending plant, and return an hour or so later with a large, empty flower pot, which he would leave somewhere conspicuously around the flat.
    The plants were the most luxurious, verdant, and beautiful in London. Also the most terrified." -- Neil Gaiman]]>
