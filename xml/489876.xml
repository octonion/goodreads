	    <![CDATA["Getting up, Luc finished his beer and set the empty bottle on the small outdoor table. The sooner he apologised for his outburst, the better. Walking into the house, he heard a thud. Panic filled him as he ran towards the back of the house.
He rounded the corner and almost ran over Justin. His partner had evidently been trying to get to his wheelchair. &quot;Baby? What're you doing?&quot; Luc asked. Kneeling on the floor, he pulled Justin into his arms.
&quot;Coming after you,&quot; Justin said. &quot;I'm...sorry.&quot;
Luc held Justin tighter as his lover began to shake. He rocked the larger body back and forth like a child. &quot;What're we gonna do with each other? I was just coming in to say the same thing to you." -- Carol Lynne]]>
