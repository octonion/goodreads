	    <![CDATA["What was that?&quot; Belgarath asked, coming back around the corner.
&quot;Brill,&quot; Silk replied blandly, pulling his Murgo robe back on.
&quot;Again?&quot; Belgarath demanded with exasperation. &quot;What was he doing this time?&quot;
&quot;Trying to fly, last time I saw him.&quot; Silk smirked.
The old man looked puzzled.
&quot;He wasn't doing it very well,&quot; Silk added.
Belgarath shrugged. &quot;Maybe it'll come to him in time.&quot;
&quot;He doesn't really have all that much time.&quot; Silk glanced out over the edge.
&quot;From far below - terribly far below - there came a faint, muffled crash; then, after several seconds, another.  &quot;Does bouncing count?&quot; Silk asked.
Belgarath made a wry face. &quot;Not really.&quot;
&quot;Then I'd say he didn't learn in time.&quot; Silk said blithely." -- David Eddings]]>
