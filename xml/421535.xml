	    <![CDATA["How often do we tell our own life story? How often do we adjust, embellish, make sly cuts? And the longer life goes on, the fewer are those around to challenge our account, to remind us that our life is not our life, merely the story we have told about our life. Told to others, but&amp;mdash;mainly&amp;mdash;to ourselves." -- Julian Barnes]]>

	    <![CDATA["Friendship- my definition- is built on two things. Respect and trust. Both elements have to be there. And it has to be mutual. You can have respect for someone, but if you don't have trust, the friendship will crumble." -- Stieg Larsson]]>
