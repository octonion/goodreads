	    <![CDATA["There are two novels that can change a bookish fourteen-year old’s life: &lt;i&gt;[book:The Lord of the Rings|10254806]&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;[book:Atlas Shrugged|9365]&lt;/i&gt;. One is a childish fantasy that often engenders a lifelong obsession with its unbelievable heroes, leading to an emotionally stunted, socially crippled adulthood, unable to deal with the real world. The other, of course, involves orcs.&quot;

Where many paths and errands meet.
And whither then? I cannot say" -- J.R.R. Tolkien]]>

to a higher plane, and purify yourself
by drinking as if it were ambrosia
the fire that fills and fuels Emptiness.

Free from the futile strivings and the cares
which dim existence to a realm of mist,
happy is he who wings an upward way
on mighty pinions to the fields of light;

whose thoughts like larks spontaneously rise
into the morning sky; whose flight, unchecked,
outreaches life and readily comprehends
the language of flowers and of all mute things." -- Charles Baudelaire]]>
