		<description>
	    <![CDATA["When the clergy addressed [author:General Washington|4356] on his departure from the government, it was observed in their consultation that he had never on any occasion said a word to the public which showed a belief in the Christian religion and they thought they should so pen their address as to force him at length to declare publicly whether he was a Christian or not. They did so. However [Dr. Rush] observed the old fox was too cunning for them. He answered every article of their address particularly except that, which he passed over without notice... I know that [author:Gouverneur Morris|945122], who pretended to be in his secrets &amp; believed himself to be so, has often told me that &lt;b&gt;[author:General Washington|4356] believed no more of that system than he himself did&lt;/b&gt;.

{&lt;i&gt;The Anas, February 1, 1800, written shortly after the death of first US president [author:George Washington|4356]&lt;/i&gt;}" -- Thomas Jefferson]]>

	    <![CDATA["While I can’t have you, I long for you. I am the kind of person who would miss a train or a plane to meet you for coffee. I’d take a taxi across town to see you for ten minutes. I’d wait outside all night if I thought you would open the door in the morning. If you call me and say ‘Will you…’ my answer is ‘Yes’, before your sentence is out. I spin worlds where we could be together. I dream you. For me, imagination and desire are very close." -- Jeanette Winterson]]>
