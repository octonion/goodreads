		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Sooner or later, you will discover which kind of father you are, and at that moment you will, with perfect horror, recognize the type. You are the kind of father who fakes it, who yells, who measures his children with greatest accuracy only against one another, who evades the uncomfortable and glosses over the painful and pads the historic records of his sorrows and accomplishments alike. You are the kind who teases and deceives and toys with his children and subjects them to displays of rich and manifold sarcasm when--as is always the case--sarcasm is the last thing they need. You are the kind of father who pretends knowledge he doesn't possess, and imposes information with implacable gratuitousness, and teaches lessons at the moment when none can be absorbed, and is right, and has always been right, and always will be right until the end of time, and never more than immediately after he has been wrong. And when your daughter's body begins to betray her, and her sky flickers in the distance with the heat lightning of sex, you clear your throat and stroke your chin whiskers and tell her to go ask her mother. You can't help it--you're a walking cliché." -- Michael Chabon]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["In Hidden Writing, a main plot is constructed to camouflage other plots (which can register themselves as plot holes) by overlapping them with the surface (superficially dynamic plot) or the grounded theme. In terms of such a writing, the main plot is the map or the concentration blueprint of plot holes (the other plots)." -- Reza Negarestani]]>

	    <![CDATA["You kneel beside her, breathing the familiar smell of Sasha's sleep, whispering into her ear some mix of &lt;i&gt;I'm sorry&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;I will never leave you, I'll be curled around your heart for the rest of your life&lt;/i&gt;, until the water pressing my shoulders and chest crushes me awake and I hear Sasha screaming into my face: &lt;i&gt;Fight! Fight! Fight!&lt;/i&gt;" -- Jennifer Egan]]>
