It was kind of lame in Morganville, truthfully, out in the middle of the prarie, in the middle of Texas, which was about as middle of nowhere as it was possible to get unless you wanted to go to Mongolia or something....

Claire started dialing numbers.  The first person told her that they'd already found somebody.... The second one sounded like a weird old guy.  The third one was a weird old lady.  The fourth one... well, the fourth one was just plain weird." -- Rachel Caine]]>

&quot;I get my very own guardian angel? What, exactly, is your job description?&quot;

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["He trapped my hand against his chest and yanked my sleeve down past my wrist, covering my hand with it. Just as quickly, he did the same thing with the other sleeve. He held my shirt by the cuffs, my hands captured. My mouth opened in protest.

Reeling me closer, he didn’t stop until I was directly in front of him. Suddenly he lifted me onto the counter. My face was level with his. He fixed me with a dark, inviting smile. And that’s when I realized this moment had been dancing around the edge of my fantasies for several days now.

&quot;Take off your hat,&quot; I said, the words tumbling out before I could stop them.

He slid it around, the brim facing backward.

I scooted to the edge of the counter, my legs dangling one on either side of him. Something inside of me was telling me to stop—but I swept that voice to the far back of my mind.

He spread his hands on the counter, just outside my hips. Tilting his head to one side, he moved closer. His scent, which was all damp dark earth, overwhelmed me.

I inhaled two sharp breaths. No. This wasn’t right. Not this, not with Patch. He was frightening. In a good way, yes. But also in a bad way. A very bad way.

&quot;You should go,&quot; I breathed. &quot;You should definitely go.&quot;

&quot;Go here?&quot; His mouth was on my shoulder. &quot;Or here?&quot; It moved up my neck.

My brain couldn’t process one logical thought. Patch’s mouth was roaming north, up over my jaw, gently sucking at my skin...

&quot;My legs are falling asleep,&quot; I blurted. It wasn’t a total lie. I was experiencing tingling sensations all
through my body, legs included.

&quot;I could solve that.&quot; Patch’s hands closed on my hips." -- Becca Fitzpatrick]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["For the briefest moment, they came face to face. Their eyes locked. Then he broke the stare, swiveled, sank into a sitting position, chains clanking, with his knees up. 
She watched him speechlessly as he set a cooler bag between his boots, like he was settling down to a picnic or something. An image of the contents as hospital blood bags, complete with juice straws, flashed through her mind. 
Unfolding her legs, she made herself as comfortable as she could on the cold outer edge of the sill. An intangible and unnameable charge electrified the space between them, and at first, neither of them said anything. 
[...] Finally she heard him unzip the bag and watched him pull out a small cylinder.
&quot;I thought you might like some crappy ice cream,&quot; he said." -- Kelly Creagh]]>

	    <![CDATA["I wrote this story for you, but when I began it I had not realized that girls grow quicker than books. As a result you are already too old for fairy tales, and by the time it is printed and bound you will be older still. But some day you will be old enough to start reading fairy tales again. You can then take it down from some upper shelf, dust it, and tell me what you think of it. I shall probably be too deaf to hear, and too old to understand a word you say, but I shall still be your affectionate Godfather, C. S. Lewis." -- C.S. Lewis]]>

	    <![CDATA["Oh.&quot; He sat in confused silence for a few seconds. &quot;Can I ask you a very serious question?&quot;
&quot;I rather you didn't,&quot; I said.
He stared straight into my eyes. &quot;If you were an animal, what animal would you be?&quot;
WAIT, WHAT? &quot;Wait, what?&quot;
&quot;It's a classic icebreaker.&quot;
&quot;If I were an ANIMAL...?&quot;
He faked a sigh and checked an imaginary watch. &quot;Your inability to answer the question doesn't bode well for-&quot;
&quot;I refuse to answer that,&quot; I said. &quot;On the grounds that it's probably the stupidest thing I've ever been asked.&quot;
He stared at me, frowning. &quot;I hear your subconscious saying MONKEY." -- Katie Alender]]>
