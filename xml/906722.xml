	    <![CDATA["So there is responsibility. I cry, you cry.  We all come running, and the one that stays quiet, the one that stays home, must explain.  Is he in league with the criminals? Is he a coward? And what would he exect when he cries? This is simple. This is normal.  This is community." -- Philip Gourevitch]]>

	    <![CDATA["Once, in my father's bookshop, I heard a regular customer say that few things leave a deeper mark on a reader than the first book that finds its way into his heart.  Those first images, the echo of words we think we have left behind, accompany us throughout our lives and sculpt a palace in our memory to which, sooner or later—no matter how many books we read, how many worlds we discover, or how much we learn or forget—we will return." -- Carlos Ruiz Zafon]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["That's why I like listening to Schubert while I'm driving. Like I said, it's because all his performances are imperfect. A dense, artistic kind of imperfection stimulates your consciousness, keeps you alert. If I listen to some utterly perfect performance of an utterly perfect piece while I'm driving, I might want to close my eyes and die right then and there. But listening to the D major, I can feel the limits of what humans are capable of - that a certain type of perfection can only be realized through a limitless accumulation of the imperfect. And personally I find that encouraging." -- Haruki Murakami]]>

To say that for destruction ice
Is also great
And would suffice." -- Robert Frost]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["It was as if that great rush of anger had washed me clean, emptied me of hope, and, gazing up at the dark sky spangled with its signs and stars, for the first time, the first, I laid my heart open to the benign indifference of the universe.
To feel it so like myself, indeed, so brotherly, made me realize that I'd been happy, and that I was happy still. For all to be accomplished, for me to feel less lonely, all that remained to hope was that on the day of my execution there should be a huge crowd of spectators and that they should greet me with howls of execration." -- Albert Camus]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["In places where a loved one has died, time stops for eternity. If I stand on the very spot, one says to oneself, like a prayer, might I feel the pain he felt? They say that on a visit to an old castle or whatever, the history of the place, the presence of people who walked there many years ago, can be felt in the body. Before, when I heard things like that, I would think, what are they talking about? But i felt I understood it now." -- Banana Yoshimoto]]>

In spite of the tempest raging within me, I walked the night path calmly." -- Banana Yoshimoto]]>

	    <![CDATA["On Drinking Alone by Moonlight
 
 
Here are flowers and here is wine,
But where’s a friend with me to join
Hand in hand and heart to heart
In one full cup before we part?

Rather than to drink alone,
I’ll make bold to ask the moon
To condescend to lend her face
The hour and the scene to grace.

Lo, she answers, and she brings
My shadow on her silver wings;
That makes three, and we shall be.
I ween, a merry company

The modest moon declines the cup,
But shadow promptly takes it up,
And when I dance my shadow fleet
Keeps measure with my flying feet.

But though the moon declines to tipple
She dances in yon shining ripple,
And when I sing, my festive song,
The echoes of the moon prolong.

Say, when shall we next meet together?
Surely not in cloudy weather,
For you my boon companions dear
Come only when the sky is clear." -- Li Po]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The sorrow of war inside a soldier's heart was in a strange way similar to the sorrow of love.  It was a kind of nostalgia, like the immense sadness of a world at dusk.  It was a daness, a missing, a pain which could send one soaring back into the past.  The sorrow of the battlefield could not normally be pinpointed to one particular event, or even one person.  If you focused on any one event it would soon become a tearing pain." -- Bao Ninh]]>

	    <![CDATA["We live in a world that assumes that the quality of a decision is directly related to the time and effort that went into making it...We believe that we are always better off gathering as much information as possible an depending as much time as possible in deliberation.  We really only trust conscious decision making.  But there are moments, particularly in times of stress, when haste does not make waste, when our snap judgments and first impressions can offer a much better means of making sense of the world.  The first task of Blink is to convince you of a simple fact: decisions made very quickly can be every bit as good as decisions made cautiously and deliberately." -- Malcolm Gladwell]]>

	    <![CDATA["our world requires that decisions be sourced and footnoted, and if we say how we feel, we must also be prepared to elaborate on why we feel that way...We need to respect the fact that it is possible to know without knowing why we know and accept that - sometimes - we're better off that way." -- Malcolm Gladwell]]>
