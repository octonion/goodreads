	    <![CDATA["For these beings, fall is ever the normal season, the only weather, there be no choice beyond. Where do they come from? The dust. Where do they go? The grave. Does blood stir their veins? No: the night wind. What ticks in their head? The worm. What speaks from their mouth? The toad. What sees from their eye? The snake. What hears with their ear? The abyss between the stars. They sift the human storm for souls, eat flesh of reason, fill tombs with sinners. They frenzy forth....Such are the autumn people." -- Ray Bradbury]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Curiosity is the single most important attribute with which humans are born. More than a simple desire to discover or know things, curiosity is a powerful tool, like a scalpel or a searchlight.  Curiosity changes us.  It is also a way to effect change, perhaps even on a global level." -- Loren Rhoads]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Yes, now you know. Now you know! That's what it was to be alive. To move about in a cloud of ignorance; to go up and down trampling on the feelings of those...of those about you. To spend and waste time as though you had a million years. To be always at the mercy of one self-centered passion, or another. Now you know â€” that's the happy existence you wanted to go back to. Ignorance and blindness." -- Thornton Wilder]]>
