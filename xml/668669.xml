	    <![CDATA["The God of the Old Testament is arguably the most unpleasant character in all fiction: jealous and proud of it; a petty, unjust, unforgiving control-freak; a vindictive, bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser; a misogynistic, homophobic, racist, infanticidal, genocidal, filicidal, pestilential, megalomaniacal, sadomasochistic, capriciously malevolent bully." -- Richard Dawkins]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["A little tap at the window, as though some missile had struck it, followed by a plentiful, falling sound, as light, though, as if a shower of sand were being sprinkled from a window overhead; then the fall spread, took on an order, a rhythm, became liquid, loud, drumming, musical, innumerable, universal. It was the rain" -- Marcel Proust]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["No sight so sad as that of a naughty child,&quot; he began, &quot;especially a naughty little girl. Do you know where the wicked go after death?&quot;

&quot;They go to hell,&quot; was my ready and orthodox answer.

&quot;And what is hell? Can you tell me that?&quot;

&quot;A pit full of fire.&quot;

&quot;And should you like to fall into that pit, and to be burning there for ever?&quot;

&quot;No, sir.&quot;

&quot;What must you do to avoid it?&quot;

I deliberated a moment: my answer, when it did come was objectionable: &quot;I must keep in good health and not die." -- Charlotte Brontë]]>
