		<description>
	    <![CDATA["There are three principles to remember if you are to teach a human being anything, and they are consistency, consistency, consistency.They are such fragile creatures to begin with, with poor eyes, poorer hearing, and no sense of smell left to speak of, it's no wonder they are made of fear. Some centuries ago they moved inside and with that move went nine-tenths of their intuition. It is almost unmerciful to make them live so long when they spend their lives in so much pain." -- Pam Houston]]>

	    <![CDATA["Linda hadn't exaggerated her fear of the golden orb weaver spider.  Up north at her cabin in Morley, I had once teased her by asking &quot;Have we ever seen this kind of vireo before?&quot; And then, instead of showing her a photo of a bird, I thrust a picture of the black-and-yellow spider at her.  She shrieked.  I laughed.  Oh, the fun we had." -- Bob Tarte]]>
