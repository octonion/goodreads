	    <![CDATA["I don't think I could love you so much if you had nothing to complain of and nothing to regret.  I don't like people who have never fallen or stumbled.  Their virtue is lifeless and of little value.  Life hasn't revealed it's beauty to them." -- Boris Pasternak]]>

	    <![CDATA["Grown-ups don't look like grown-ups on the inside either. Outside, they're big and thoughtless and they always know what they're doing. Inside, they look just like they always have. Like they did when they were your age. Truth is, there aren't any grown-ups. Not one, in the whole wide world." -- Neil Gaiman]]>
