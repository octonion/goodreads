		<description>
	    <![CDATA["It surprised him that his grief was sharper than in the past few days. He had forgotten that grief does not decline in a straight line or along a slow curve like a graph in a child's math book.

	    <![CDATA["I believe there is a great deal too much mutual confession going on today, as if sharing oneâ€™s problems somehow makes them go away. All it really does, of course, is increase the number of people who have to worry about a particular issue." -- Helen Simonson]]>

	    <![CDATA["You are a wise man, Major, and I will consider your advice with great care--and humility.&quot; He finished his tea and rose from the table to go to his room. &quot;But I must ask you, do you really understand what it means to be in love with an unsuitable woman?&quot; 

 &quot;My dear boy,&quot; said the Major. &quot;Is there really any other kind?" -- Helen Simonson]]>
