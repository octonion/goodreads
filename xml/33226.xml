	    <![CDATA["We are all alone, born alone, die alone, and -- in spite of True Romance magazines -- we shall all someday look back on our lives and see that, in spite of our company, we were alone the whole way. I do not say lonely -- at least, not all the time -- but essentially, and finally, alone. This is what makes your self-respect so important, and I don't see how you can respect yourself if you must look in the hearts and minds of others for your happiness." -- Hunter S. Thompson]]>

	    <![CDATA["Let us toast to animal pleasures, to escapism, to rain on the roof and instant coffee, to unemployment insurance and library cards, to absinthe and good-hearted landlords, to music and warm bodies and contraceptives... and to the &quot;good life&quot;, whatever it is and wherever it happens to be." -- Hunter S.

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Civil disobedience is not our problem. Our problem is civil obedience. Our problem is that people all over the world have obeyed the dictates of leaders…and millions have been killed because of this obedience…Our problem is that people are obedient allover the world in the face of poverty and starvation and stupidity, and war, and cruelty. Our problem is that people are obedient while the jails are full of petty thieves… (and) the grand thieves are running the country. That’s our problem." -- Howard Zinn]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The challenge remains.  On the other side are formidable forces: money, political power, the major media.  On our side are the people of the world and a power greater than money or weapons: the truth.
Truth has a power of its own.  Art has a power of its own.  That age-old lesson – that everything we do matters – is the meaning of the people’s struggle here in the United States and everywhere.  A poem can inspire a movement.  A pamphlet can spark a revolution.  Civil disobedience can arouse people and provoke us to think, when we organize with one another, when we get involved, when we stand up and speak out together, we can create a power no government can suppress.  We live in a beautiful country.  But people who have no respect for human life, freedom, or justice have taken it over.  It is now up to all of us to take it back." -- Howard Zinn]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Nations are not communities and never have been.  The history of any country, presented as the history of a family, conceals the fierce conflicts of interest (sometimes exploding, often repressed) between conquerors and conquered, masters and slaves, capitalists and workers, dominators and dominated in race and sex.  And in such as world of conflict, a world of victims and executioners, it is the job of thinking people, as Albert Camus suggested, not to be on the side of the executioners." -- Howard Zinn]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["TO BE HOPEFUL in bad times is not just foolishly romantic. It is based on the fact that human history is a history not only of cruelty, but also of compassion, sacrifice, courage, kindness.
What we choose to emphasize in this complex history will determine our lives. If we see only the worst, it destroys our capacity to do something. If we remember those times and places—and there are so many—where people have behaved magnificently, this gives us the energy to act, and at least the possibility of sending this spinning top of a world in a different direction.
And if we do act, in however small a way, we don’t have to wait for some grand utopian future. The future is an infinite succession of presents, and to live now as we think human beings should live, in defiance of all that is bad around us, is itself a marvelous victory." -- Howard Zinn]]>

	    <![CDATA["In youth, it was a way I had,
To do my best to please.
And change, with every passing lad
To suit his theories.

But now I know the things I know
And do the things I do,
And if you do not like me so,
To hell, my love, with you." -- Dorothy Parker]]>

	    <![CDATA["&lt;i&gt;Inventory:&lt;/i&gt;

&quot;Four be the things I am wiser to know:
Idleness, sorrow, a friend, and a foe.
Four be the things I'd been better without:
Love, curiosity, freckles, and doubt.
Three be the things I shall never attain:
Envy, content, and sufficient champagne.
Three be the things I shall have till I die:
Laughter and hope and a sock in the eye." -- Dorothy Parker]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["A Very Short Song 

Once, when I was young and true, 
Someone left me sad- 
Broke my brittle heart in two; 
And that is very bad. 

Love is for unlucky folk, 
Love is but a curse. 
Once there was a heart I broke; 
And that, I think, is worse." -- Dorothy Parker]]>
