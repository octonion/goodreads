	    <![CDATA["Sir Richard sighed. &quot;Rid yourself of the notion that I cherish any villainous designs upon your person,&quot; he said. &quot;I imagine I might well be your father. How old are you?&quot;

&quot;I am turned seventeen.&quot;

&quot;Well, I am nearly thirty,&quot; said Sir Richard.

Miss Creed worked this out. &quot;You couldn't possibly be my father!&quot;

&quot;I am far too drunk to solve arithmetical problems. Let it suffice that I have not the slightest intention of making love to you." -- Georgette Heyer]]>
