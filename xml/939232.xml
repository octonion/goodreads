Grover cracked a smile. &quot;The dam snack bar?&quot;
Zoe blinked. &quot;Yes. What is funny?&quot;
&quot;Nothing,&quot; Grover said, trying to keep a straight face. &quot;I could use some dam french fries.&quot;
Even Thalia smiled at that. &quot;And I need to use the dam restroom.&quot;
...
I started cracking up, and Thalia and Grover joined in, while Zoe just looked at me. &quot;I do not understand.&quot;
&quot;I want to use the dam water fountain,&quot; Grover said.
&quot;And...&quot; Thalia tried to catch her breath. &quot;I want to buy a dam t-shirt." -- Rick Riordan]]>

You'd probably kick my butt.&quot;

You &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt; I'd kick your butt.&quot;

I brushed the cake off my hands. &quot;When I was at the River Styx, turning invulnerable . . . Nico said I had to concentrate on one thing that kept me anchored to the world, that made me want to stay mortal.&quot;

Annabeth kept her eyes on the horizon. &quot;Yeah?&quot;

Then up on Olympus,&quot; I said, &quot;when they wanted to make me a god and stuff, I kept thinking-&quot;

Oh, you so wanted to.&quot;

Well, maybe a little. But I didn't, because I thought-I didn't want things to stay the same for eternity, because things could always get better. And I was thinking . . .&quot; My throat felt really dry.

Anyone in particular?&quot; Annabeth asked, her voice soft.

I looked over and saw that she was trying not to smile.

You're laughing at me,&quot; I complained.

I am not!&quot;

You are &lt;i&gt;so&lt;/i&gt; not making this easy.&quot;

Then she laughed for real, and she put her hands 
around my neck. &quot;I am never, &lt;i&gt;ever&lt;/i&gt; going to make things easy for you, Seaweed Brain. Get used to it." -- Rick Riordan]]>

The voice stopped abruptly, The anger retreated, which was a good thing, because just those two words had almost blasted my mind to shreds. 
&lt;i&gt;Percy.&lt;/i&gt; My fathers voice was still angry but more controlled. &lt;i&gt;What-exactly-are you doing on my throne?&lt;/i&gt;
&quot;I'm sorry, Father,&quot; I said. &quot;I needed to get your attention.&quot;
&lt;i&gt;This was a very dangerous thing to do. Even for you. If I hadn't looked before I blasted, you would now be a puddle of seawater.&lt;/i&gt;" -- Rick Riordan]]>

	    <![CDATA["Very slowly using two fingers, Annabeth drew her dagger. Instead of dropping it, she tossed it as far as she could into the water. 

Octavian made a squeaking sound. &quot;What was that for? I didn't say &lt;i&gt;toss&lt;/i&gt; it! That could've been evidence. Or spoils of war!&quot;

Annabeth tried for a dumb-blonde smile, like: &lt;i&gt;Oh, silly me.&lt;/i&gt; Nobody who knew her would have been fooled. But Octavian seemed to buy it. He huffed in exasperation. 

&quot;You other two...&quot; He pointed his blade a Hazel and Piper. &quot;Put your weapons on the dock. No funny bus--&quot;

All around the Romans, Charleston Harbor erupted like a Las Vegas fountain putting on a show. When the wall of seawater subsided, the three Romans were in the bay, spluttering and frantically trying to stay afloat in their armor. Percy stood on the dock, holding Annabeth's dagger. 

&quot;You dropped this,&quot; he said, totally poker-faced." -- rick riordan]]>
