	    <![CDATA["I could love you, I could kill you. I want this. This is how I make my mark, this is where I plant my flag, this is how I stake my claim, this is how I deny you, this is how I claim you, this is what you owe me, this is what I am taking, this is how I know I'm alive." -- Louise Dean]]>

	    <![CDATA["O gouvernment francais, I think it was not very clever of You to put this terrible doll in La Ferte; for when Governments are found dead there is always a little doll on top of them, pulling and tweaking with his little hands to get back at the microscopic knife which sticks firmly in the quiet meat of their hearts." -- E. E. Cummings]]>

	    <![CDATA["The words were a paraphrase of the suggestion of Jesus: &quot;Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's.&quot;
   Bokonon's paraphrase was this:
   &quot;Pay no attention to Caesar. Caesar doesn't have the slightest idea what's really going on." -- Kurt Vonnegut]]>

	    <![CDATA["You hate America, don't you?'

That would be as silly as loving it,' I said. 'It's impossible for me to get emotional about it, because real estate doesn't interest me. It's no doubt a great flaw in my personality, but I can't think in terms of boundaries. Those imaginary lines are as unreal to me as elves and pixies. I can't believe that they mark the end or the beginning of anything of real concern to a human soul. Virtues and vices, pleasures and pains cross boundaries at will." -- Kurt Vonnegut]]>
