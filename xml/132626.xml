	    <![CDATA["A public library is the most democratic thing in the world. What can be found there has undone dictators and tyrants: demagogues can persecute writers and tell them what to write as much as they like, but they cannot vanish what has been written in the past, though they try often enough...People who love literature have at least part of their minds immune from indoctrination. If you read, you can learn to think for yourself." -- Doris Lessing]]>

	    <![CDATA["I don't believe in colleges and universities.  I believe in libraries because most students don't have any money.  When I graduated from high school, it was during the Depression and we had no money.  I couldn't go to college, so I went to the library three days a week for 10 years." -- Ray Bradbury]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["When I had no books and had to learn everything I needed off by heart, and when I had to hide what books I had, I promised myself a library filled with the best editions I could afford. I have it now. Books bought out of books. A red room with deep chairs and a fireplace lit. Books of every kind, but no paperbacks, and certain shelves where First Editions are. This is not my study, where there are plenty of paperbacks, it is a contemplative island cut off from busyness, set outside of time." -- Jeanette Winterson]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["What is the meaning of life? That was all- a simple question; one that tended to close in on one with years, the great revelation had never come. The great revelation perhaps never did come. Instead, there were little daily miracles, illuminations, matches struck unexpectedly in the dark; here was one." -- Virginia Woolf]]>

I would, even if I had to adapt one, even if I had to make one up just for her. &quot;Gets away from what, though?&quot;

&quot;From her fairy godmother. From the happy ending that isn't really happy at all. Please have her get out and run off of the page altogether, to somewhere secret where words like 'happy' and 'good' will never find her.&quot;

&quot;You don't want her to be happy and good?&quot;

&quot;I'm not sure what's really meant by happy and good. I would like her to be free. Now. Please begin." -- Helen Oyeyemi]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["She isn't a storm or a leader or a king or a war or anyone whose life and death makes noise. The problem is words. There is skin, yes. And then, inside that, there is your language, the casual, inherited magic spells taht make your skin real. It's too late now--even if we could say &quot;Shut up&quot; or &quot;Where's my dinner?&quot; in the first language, the real language, the words weren't born in us. And unless your skin and your language touch each other without interruption, there is no word strong enough to make you understand that it matters that you live. The things that really &quot;stay&quot; are an Orisha, a kind night, a pretended boy, a garden song that made no sense. Those come closer to being enough." -- Helen Oyeyemi]]>
