		<description>
	    <![CDATA["If you're 50 years old or younger, give every book about 50 pages before you decide to commit yourself to reading it, or give it up.

If you're over 50, which is when time gets shorter, subtract your age from 100 - the result is the number of pages you should read before deciding whether or not to quit. If you're 100 or over you get to judge the book by its cover, despite the dangers in doing so." -- Nancy Pearl]]>

	    <![CDATA["Forget trying to pass for normal.  Follow your geekdom.  Embrace nerditude.  In the immortal words of Lafcadio Hearn, a geek of incredible obscurity whose work is still in print after a hundred years, “Woo the muse of the odd.”  You may be a geek.  You may have geek written all over you.  You should aim to be one geek they'll never forget.  Don't aim to be civilized.  Don’t hope that straight people will keep you on as some sort of pet.  To hell with them.  You should fully realize what society has made of you and take a terrible revenge.  Get weird.  Get way weird.  Get dangerously weird.  Get sophisticatedly, thoroughly weird, and don't do it halfway.  Put every ounce of horsepower you have behind it.  Don't become a well-rounded person.  Well-rounded people are smooth and dull.  Become a thoroughly spiky person.  Grow spikes from every angle.  Stick in their throats like a pufferfish." -- Bruce Sterling]]>
