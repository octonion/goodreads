	    <![CDATA["You made me confess the fears that I have. But I will tell you also what I do not fear. I do not fear to be alone or to be spurned for another or to leave whatever I have to leave.  And I am not afraid to make a mistake, even a great mistake, a lifelong mistake and perhaps as long as eternity too." -- James Joyce]]>
