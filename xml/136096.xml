He'd clung to the memories of their time together like a fucking child clings to its baby blanket, unable to give it up even after that blanket had been chewed on, bled on, tattered, and finally shredded to pieces.

Even after that blanket was no longer a blanket but just a memory.
That's all he and Dorothy were now. Just a fucking memory." -- Madeline Sheehan]]>
