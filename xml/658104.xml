	    <![CDATA["It's not possible to search for God using the methods of a detective... There is no way. You can only wait till God's axe severs your roots: then you will understand that you are here only through a miracle, and you will remain fixed forever in wonderment and equilibrium." -- Karel Čapek]]>

	    <![CDATA["Alas,&quot; said Aslan, shaking his head. &quot;It will. Things always work according to their nature. She has won her heart's desire; she has unwearying strength and endless days like a goddess. But length of days with an evil heart is only length of misery and already she begins to know it. All get what they want; they do not always like it." -- C.S. Lewis]]>

	    <![CDATA["Oh, they're there all right,&quot; Orr had assured him about the flies in Appleby's eyes after Yossarian's fist fight in the officers' club, &quot;although he probably doesn't even know it. That's why he can't see things as they really are.&quot; 

&quot;How come he doesn't know it?&quot; inquired Yossarian. 

&quot;Because he's got flies in his eyes,&quot; Orr explained with exaggerated patience. &quot;How can he see he's got flies in his eyes if he's got flies in his eyes?" -- Joseph Heller]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["One who contended that a poem was nothing but black marks on white paper would be unanswerable if he addressed an audience who couldn't read.  Look at it through microscopes, analyse the printer's ink and the paper, study it (in that way) as long as you like; you will never find something over and above all the products of analysis whereof you can say &quot;This is the poem.&quot;  Those who can read, however, will continue to say the poem exists." -- C.S. Lewis]]>
