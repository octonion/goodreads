		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Every reader, as he reads, is actually the reader of himself.  The writer's work is only a kind of optical instrument he provides the reader so he can discern what he might never have seen in himself without this book.  The reader's recognition in himself of what the book says is the proof of the book's truth." -- Marcel Proust]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["If one wanted to depict the whole thing graphically, every episode, with its climax, would require a three-dimensional, or, rather, no model: every experience is unrepeatable. What makes lovemaking and reading resemble each other most is that within both of them times and spaces open, different from measurable time and space." -- Italo Calvino]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Love is not all: It is not meat nor drink
Nor slumber nor a roof against the rain,
Nor yet a floating spar to men that sink
and rise and sink and rise and sink again.
Love cannot fill the thickened lung with breath
Nor clean the blood, nor set the fractured bone;
Yet many a man is making friends with death
even as I speak, for lack of love alone.
It well may be that in a difficult hour,
pinned down by need and moaning for release
or nagged by want past resolution's power,
I might be driven to sell your love for peace,
Or trade the memory of this night for food.
It may well be. I do not think I would." -- Edna St. Vincent Millay]]>
