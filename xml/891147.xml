	    <![CDATA["Humility is just as much the opposite of self-abasement as it is of self-exaltation.  To be humble is not to make comparisons.  Secure in its reality, the self is neither better nor worse, bigger nor smaller, than anything else in the universe.  It *is*--is nothing, yet at the same time one with everything.  It is in this sense that humility is absolute self-effacement.

To be nothing in the self-effacement of humility, yet, for the sake of the task, to embody its whole weight and importance in your earing, as the one who has been called to undertake it.  To give to people, works, poetry, art, what the self can contribute, and to take, simply and freely, what belongs to it by reason of its identity.  Praise and blame, the winds of success and adversity, blow over such a life without leaving a trace or upsetting its balance." -- Dag Hammarskjöld]]>
