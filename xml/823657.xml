	    <![CDATA["Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky,
 Seven for the Dwarf-lords in halls of stone,
Nine for Mortal Men, doomed to die,
 One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne
In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.
 One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,
 One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.
In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie." -- J. R. R. Tolkien]]>

	    <![CDATA["Everyone must leave something behind when he dies, my grandfather said. A child or a book or a painting or a house or a wall built or a pair of shoes made. Or a garden planted. Something your hand touched some way so your soul has somewhere to go when you die, and when people look at that tree or that flower you planted, you're there. 

It doesn't matter what you do, he said, so long as you change something from the way it was before you touched it into something that's like you after you take your hands away. The difference between the man who just cuts lawns and a real gardener is in the touching, he said. The lawn-cutter might just as well not have been there at all; the gardener will be there a lifetime." -- Ray Bradbury]]>

	    <![CDATA["He'll be coming and going&quot; he had said. &quot;One day you'll see him and another you won't. He doesn't like being tied down--and of course he has other countries to attend to. It's quite all right. He'll often drop in. Only you mustn't press him. He's wild, you know. Not like a tame lion." -- C.S. Lewis]]>
