		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Now the standard cure for one who is sunk is to consider those in actual destitution or physical suffering—this is an all-weather beatitude for gloom in general and fairly salutary day-time advice for everyone. But at three o’clock in the morning, a forgotten package has the same tragic importance as a death sentence, and the cure doesn’t work—and in a real dark night of the soul it is always three o’clock in the morning, day after day." -- F. Scott Fitzgerald]]>

If I were to live my life
in catfish forms
in scaffolds of skin and whiskers
at the bottom of a pond
and you were to come by
	one evening
when the moon was shining
down into my dark home
and stand there at the edge
	of my affection
and think, “It's beautiful
here by this pond. I wish
	somebody loved me,”
I'd love you and be your catfish
friend and drive such lonely
thoughts from your mind
and suddenly you would be
	at peace,
and ask yourself, “I wonder
if there are any catfish
in this pond? It seems like
a perfect place for them." -- Richard Brautigan]]>

	    <![CDATA["Three of the four elements are shared by all creatures, but fire was a gift to humans alone.  Smoking cigarettes is as intimate as we can become with fire without immediate excruciation.  Every smoker is an embodiment of Prometheus, stealing fire from the gods and bringing it on back home.  We smoke to capture the power of the sun, to pacify Hell, to identify with the primordial spark, to feed on them arrow of the volcano.  It's not the tobacco we're after but the fire.  When we smoke, we are performing a version of the fire dance, a ritual as ancient as lightning." -- Tom Robbins]]>
