Nine hours ago, I broke off the single most pointlessly agonizing one-way relationship of my young life.
It was a thin slice of hell, and now it is &lt;I&gt;over.&lt;/I&gt;. He's not mine.  He never &lt;I&gt;will&lt;/I&gt; be mine, and I've thrown away three years of my life pining and hoping. Well, not anymore, and I need to get him out of my system.  I've given the matter serious thought, and all I want right now is for some total stranger to nail me to a mattress for the next fourteen hours.  I will almost certainly cry all over you and call you by his name, but I assure you that my sexual frustration has built to such a fever peak that I will fuck you &lt;I&gt;dry.&lt;/I&gt; What do you say?&quot;
