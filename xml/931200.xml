	    <![CDATA["many people must be ruled to thrive. In their selfishness and greed, they see free people as their oppressors. They wish to have a leader who will cut the taller plants so the sun will reach them. They think no plant should be allowed to grow taller than the shortest, and in that way give light to all. They would rather be provided a guiding light, regardless of the fuel, than light a candle themselves." -- Terry Goodkind]]>

	    <![CDATA["I thought I told you to stop doing that,&quot; he snapped. 
A thin-lipped mouth opened; the jutting chin and nose knocked together  indignantly. &quot;Do what?&quot;
&quot;Taking on such a hideous appearance. I've just had my breakfast.&quot; 
A section of brow lifted, allowing an eyeball to roll forward  with a squelching sound.The face looked 
unapologetic.&quot;Sorry, mate,&quot; it said. &quot;It's just my job.&quot; 
&quot;Your job is to destroy anyone entering my study without authority. No more, no less.&quot; 
The door guard considered. &quot;True. But I seek to preempt entry by scaring trespassers away. To my way 
of thinking, deterrence is more aesthetically satisfying than punishment.&quot; 
Mr. Mandrake snorted. &quot;Trespassers apart, you'll likely  frighten Ms. Piper here to death.&quot; 
The face shook from  side to side, a process that  caused the nose to wobble alarmingly. &quot;Not so. When 
she comes alone, I moderate my features. I reserve the full horror for those I consider morally vicious.&quot; 
&quot;But you just looked that way to me!&quot; 
&quot;The contradiction being...?" -- Jonathan Stroud]]>
