	    <![CDATA["I like the relaxed way in which the Japanese approach religion. I think of myself as basically a moral person, but I'm definitely not religious, and I'm very tired of the preachiness and obsession with other people's behavior characteristic of many religious people in the United States. As far as I could tell, there's nothing preachy about Buddhism. I was in a lot of temples, and I still don't know what Buddhists believe, except that at one point Kunio said 'If you do bad things, you will be reborn as an ox.'

This makes as much sense to me as anything I ever heard from, for example, the Reverend Pat Robertson." -- Dave Barry]]>

	    <![CDATA["I do value my work awfully; but in reality only consider this:   all this world of ours is nothing but a speck of mildew, which has grown up on a tiny planet.  And for us to suppose we can have something great - ideas, work - it's all dust and ashes." -- Leo Tolstoy]]>
