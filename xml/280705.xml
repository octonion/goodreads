		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Greater in battle
than the man who would conquer
a thousand-thousand men,
is he who would conquer
just one â€”
himself.
Better to conquer yourself
than others.
When you've trained yourself,
living in constant self-control,
neither a deva nor gandhabba,
nor a Mara banded with Brahmas,
could turn that triumph
back into defeat." -- Buddha]]>

Renewed shall be blade that was broken,
The crownless again shall be king." -- J.R.R. Tolkien]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I believe in the supreme worth of the individual and in his right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. 

I believe that every right implies a responsibility; every opportunity, an obligation; every possession, a duty.

I believe that the law was made for man and not man for the law; that government is the servant of the people and not their master. 

I believe in the dignity of labor, whether with head or hand; that the world owes no man a living but that it owes every man an opportunity to make a living. 

I believe that thrift is essential to well-ordered living and that economy is a prime requisite of a sound financial structure, whether in government, business or personal affairs. 

I believe that truth and justice are fundamental to an enduring social order. 

I believe in the sacredness of a promise, that a man's word should be as good as his bond, that characterâ€”not wealth or power or positionâ€”is of supreme worth. 

I believe that the rendering of useful service is the common duty of mankind and that only in the purifying fire of sacrifice is the dross of selfishness consumed and the greatness of the human soul set free. 

I believe in an all-wise and all-loving God, named by whatever name, and that the individual's highest fulfillment, greatest happiness and widest usefulness are to be found in living in harmony with His will. 

I believe that love is the greatest thing in the world; that it alone can overcome hate; that right can and will triumph over might." -- John D. Rockefeller]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["To understand reality is not the same as to know about outward events. It is to perceive the essential nature of things. The best-informed man is not necessarily the wisest. Indeed there is a danger that precisely in the multiplicity of his knowledge he will lose sight of what is essential. But on the other hand, knowledge of an apparently trivial detail quite often makes it possible to see into the depths of things. And so the wise man will seek to acquire the best possible knowledge about events, but always without becoming dependent upon this knowledge. To recognize the significant in the factual is wisdom." -- Dietrich Bonhoeffer]]>
