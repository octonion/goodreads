	    <![CDATA["We had all opted to take City's financial reporting course work, which, in theory, meant we wanted to write about stock prices and corporate takeovers. That, of course, was a joke. No one still in their twenties, and broke, goes into journalism to write about money—a subject in which they still have zero practical experience." -- Chris Ayres]]>

	    <![CDATA["The movies, I thought, have got the soundtrack to war all wrong. War isn't rock 'n' roll. It's got nothing to do with Jimi Hendrix or Richard Wagner. War is nursery rhymes and early Madonna tracks. War is the music from your childhood. Because war, when it's not making you kill or be killed, turns you into an infant. For the past eight days, I'd been living like a five-year-old — a nonexistence of daytime naps, mushy food, and lavatory breaks. My adult life was back in Los Angeles with my dirty dishes and credit card bills." -- Chris Ayres]]>

	    <![CDATA["In the simple moral maxim the Marine Corps teaches 

— do the right thing, for the right reason 

— no exception exists that says: unless there's criticism or risk. Damn the consequences." -- Josh Rushing]]>
