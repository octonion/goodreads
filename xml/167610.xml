	    <![CDATA["It is a perverse tradition we honor. Kings adorn their halls with images of battles they won, the people they've conquered.&quot; He paced as he vented, a lifetime frustration pent up in that twisted truth. &quot;I have brought kingdoms on the brink of war to peace, and my deeds will never be deemed as heroic as those who kill.&quot; - Paris of Troy." -- Aria Cunningham]]>

	    <![CDATA["&lt;i&gt;&quot;The love that you receive is equal to the love you give... And for those rare souls who give with no thought of receipt... only they are worthy of the eternal love; the force that breaks bonds of brotherhood, that transcends the vagaries of pride and ego, a binding of souls that endures across the Ages&quot;&lt;/i&gt; - Tyrphosa, Priestess of Aphrodite" -- Aria Cunningham]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["So many times during the day, Helen had seen a dark presence take hold of the prince, as though he was haunted by some dire purpose or secret too terrible to bear. As she stared up into his almond eyes, she saw it again, this time recognizing the darkness for what it was: the same abandonment she felt ripping her heart in pieces." -- Aria Cunningham]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["A fire burned in his belly with Helen's words, her challenge laid bare. &lt;i&gt;Are you a king worthy of great glory, or a pretender clamoring for attention at the edge of the world?&lt;/i&gt; One look to Menelaus was all the reminder Agamemnon needed of how much he detested that comparison." -- Aria Cunningham]]>
