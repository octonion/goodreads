	    <![CDATA["Your life is your practice.  Your spiritual practice does not occur someplace other than in your life right now, and your life is nowhere other than where you are.  You are looking for answers, insight, and wisdom that you already possess.  Live the life in front of you, be the life you are, and see what you find out for yourself." -- Karen Maezen Miller]]>

	    <![CDATA["I was a little excited but mostly blorft. &quot;Blorft&quot; is an adjective I just made up that means 'Completely overwhelmed but proceeding as if everything is fine and reacting to the stress with the torpor of a possum.' I have been blorft every day for the past seven years." -- Tina Fey]]>

	    <![CDATA["Lesson learned? When people say, &quot;You really, really must&quot; do something, it means you don't really have to. No one ever says, &quot;You really, really must deliver the baby during labor.&quot; When it's true, it doesn't need to be said." -- Tina Fey]]>
