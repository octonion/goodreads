	    <![CDATA["We talked and talked and talked. Maybe love comes in at the eyes, but not nearly as much as it comes in at the ears, at least in my experience. As we talked, lights flicked on inside my head; by the end of the night I was a planterium." -- Marisa de los Santos]]>

	    <![CDATA["&lt;em&gt;I'll pit my God against your god&lt;/em&gt; any day, I say to the Calvinists.  It's not their god I'm praying to....  The God I'm praying to is neither male nor female.  My God is the one who exists apart from all of men's agendas, the God who takes you away when there is no possible place you can go." -- Brunonia Barry]]>

	    <![CDATA["It's a GIRL.
It's a little girl, with scrunched-up petal lips and a tuft of dark hair and hands in tiny fits, up by her ears. All that time, that's who was in there. And it's weird, but the minute I saw her I just thought: IT'S YOU. Of course it is." -- Sophie Kinsella]]>

	    <![CDATA["That's death and life, you see. We all shine on. You just have to release your hearts, alert your senses, and pay attention. A leaf, a star, a song, a laugh. Notice all the little things, because somebody is reaching out to you. Qualcuno ti ama. Somebody loves you." -- Ben Sherwood]]>
