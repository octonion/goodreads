	    <![CDATA["Some day, Locke Lamora,” he said, “some day, you’re going to fuck up so magnificently, so ambitiously, so overwhelmingly that the sky will light up and the moons will spin and the gods themselves will shit comets with glee. And I just hope I’m still around to see it.”
“Oh please,” said Locke. “It’ll never happen." -- Scott Lynch]]>

	    <![CDATA["I cut off his fingers to get him to talk, and when he'd confessed everything I wanted to hear, I had his fucking tongue cut out, and the stump cauterized.&quot;

Everyone in the room stared at him.

&quot;I called him an asshole, too,&quot; said Locke. &quot;He didn't like that." -- Scott Lynch]]>
