	    <![CDATA["You - you alone will have the stars as no one else has them...In one of the stars I shall be living. In one of them I shall be laughing. And so it will be as if all the stars were laughing, when you look at the sky at night...You - only you - will have stars that can laugh." -- Antoine de Saint-Exupéry]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["All men have stars, but they are not the same things for different people. For some, who are travelers, the stars are guides. For others they are no more than little lights in the sky. For others, who are scholars, they are problems... But all these stars are silent. You-You alone will have stars as no one else has them... In one of the stars I shall be living. In one of them I shall be laughing. And so it will be as if all the stars will be laughing when you look at the sky at night..You, only you, will have stars that can laugh! And when your sorrow is comforted (time soothes all sorrows) you will be content that you have known me... You will always be my friend. You will want to laugh with me. And you will sometimes open your window, so, for that pleasure... It will be as if, in place of the stars, I had given you a great number of little bells that knew how to laugh" -- Antoine de Saint-Exupéry]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["We swung over the hills and over the town and back again, and I saw how a man can be master of a craft, and how a craft can be master of an element.  I saw the alchemy of perspective reduce my world, and all my other life, to grains in a cup.  I learned to watch, to put my trust in other hands than mine.  And I learned to wander.  I learned what every dreaming child needs to know -- that no horizon is so far that you cannot get above it or beyond it." -- Beryl Markham]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["One day the stars will be as familiar to each man as the landmarks, the curves, and the hills on the road that leads to his door, and one day this will be an airborne life.  But by then men will have forgotten how to fly; they will be passengers on machines whose conductors are carefully promoted to a familiarity with labelled buttons, and in whose minds knowledge of the sky and the wind and the way of weather will be extraneous as passing fiction." -- Beryl Markham]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I look at my yesterdays for months past, and find them as good a lot of yesterdays as anybody might want.  I sit there in the firelight and see them all.  The hours that made them were good, and so were the moments that made the hours.  I have had responsibilities and work, dangers and pleasure, good friends, and a world without walls to live in." -- Beryl Markham]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I had never realized before how quickly men deteriorate without razors and clean shirts.  They are like potted plants that go to weed unless they are pruned and tended daily.  A single day's growth beard makes a man look careless; two days', derelict; and four days', polluted.  Blix and Weston hadn't shaved for three." -- Beryl Markham]]>
