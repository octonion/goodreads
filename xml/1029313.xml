		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Right now I want a word that describes the feeling that you get--a cold sick feeling, deep down inside--when you know something is happening that will change you, and you don't want it to, but you can't stop it. And you know, for the first time, for the very first time, that there will now be a &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; and an &lt;i&gt;after&lt;/i&gt;, a &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; and a &lt;i&gt;will be&lt;/i&gt;. And that you will never again quite be the same person you were." -- Jennifer Donnelly]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Sometimes,&quot; Jem said, &quot;our lives can change so fast that the change outpaces our minds and hearts. It's those times, I think, when our lives have altered but we still long for the time before everything was altered-- that is when we feel the greatest pain. I can tell you, though, from experience, you grow accustomed to it. You learn to live your new life, and you can't imagine, or even really remember, how things were before." -- Cassandra Clare]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Just because I liked something at one point in time doesn’t mean I’ll always like it, or that I have to go on liking it at all points in time as an unthinking act of loyalty to who I am as a person, based solely on who I was as a person. To be loyal to myself is to allow myself to grow and change, and challenge who I am and what I think. The only thing I am for sure is unsure, and this means I’m growing, and not stagnant or shrinking." -- Jarod Kintz]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["This was when I learned that you have to give up your life as you know it to get a new one: that sometimes you need to let go of everything you're clinging to and start over, whether because you've outgrown it or because it's not working anymore, or because it was wrong for you in the first place." -- Kelly Cutrone]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Sometimes customizing is necessary because of an injury or the inability to do, for a short or long period, the kind of exercise you formerly did.  When you're used to customizing for fun, doing it under duress won't seem like such an imposition.  Either way, experiment until you find activities that make you happy as well as healthy.  Choose your exercise using the same criteria you'd apply to choosing a date--that is, attractive to you and able to hold your interest for an hour." -- Victoria Moran]]>
