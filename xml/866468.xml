	    <![CDATA["Niall had been able to mask the odor of fairy from Eric in the restaurant, but I saw from the flare of Eric's nostrils that the intoxicating scent clung to me. Eric's eyes closed in ecstasy, and he actually licked his lips. I felt like a T-bone just out of reach of a hungry dog. 
&quot;Snap out of it,&quot; I said. I wasn't in the mood.
With a huge effort, Eric reigned himself in. &quot;When you smell like that,&quot; he said, &quot;I just wanna fuck you and bite you and rub myself all over you." -- Charlaine Harris]]>
