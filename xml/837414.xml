	    <![CDATA["You should not have any special fondness for a particular weapon, or anything else, for that matter.  Too much is the same as not enough.  Without imitating anyone else, you should have as much weaponry as suits you." -- Miyamoto Musashi]]>

	    <![CDATA["Yet, the principle of uncertainty is a bad name. In science or outside of it, we are not uncertain.  Our knowledge is merely confined within a certain tolerance.  We should call it the principle of tolerance.  First in the engineering sense.  Science has progressed, step by step, the most successful enterprise in the ascent of man, because it has understood that the exchange of information between man and nature, and man and man, can only take place with a certain tolerance.  But I also use the word, passionately, about the real world. All knowledge, all information, between human beings, can only be exchanged within a play of tolerance, and that's whether it's in science, or in literature, or in religion, or in politics, or in any form of though that aspires to dogma." -- Jacob Bronowski]]>
