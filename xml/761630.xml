		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Once, in my father's bookshop, I heard a regular customer say that few things leave a deeper mark on a reader than the first book that finds its way into his heart.  Those first images, the echo of words we think we have left behind, accompany us throughout our lives and sculpt a palace in our memory to which, sooner or later—no matter how many books we read, how many worlds we discover, or how much we learn or forget—we will return." -- Carlos Ruiz Zafon]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["If you take a book with you on a journey,&quot; Mo had said when he put the first one in her box, &quot;an odd thing happens: The book begins collecting your memories. And forever after you have only to open that book to be back where you first read it. It will all come into your mind with the very first words: the sights you saw in that place, what it smelled like, the ice cream you ate while you were reading it... yes, books are like flypaper—memories cling to the printed page better than anything else." -- Cornelia Funke]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["For him that stealeth,or borroweth and returneth not,this book from its owner, let it change into a serpent in his hand and rend him. 
Let him be struck with palsy, and all his members blasted. 
Let him languish in pain, crying aloud for mercy, and let there be no surcease to this agony till he sing in dissolution. 
Let bookworms gnaw his entrails in token of the worm that dieth not, and when at last he goeth to his last punishment, let the flames of hell consume him for ever.

&lt;i&gt;Curse on book thieves&lt;/i&gt;, from the monastery of San Pedro, Barcelona, Spain" -- Cornelia Funke]]>

	    <![CDATA["Well, this is a story about books.&quot;

About books?&quot;

About accursed books, about a man who wrote them, about a character who broke out of the pages of anovel so that he could burn it, about a betrayal and a lost friendship. It's a story of love, of hatred, and of the dreams that live in the shadow of the wind.&quot;

You talk like the jacket blurb of a Victorian novel, Daniel.&quot;

That's probably because I work in a bookshop and I've seen too many. But this is a true story." -- Carlos Ruiz Zafón]]>
