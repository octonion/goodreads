	    <![CDATA["Behind me, I heard a young woman of 25 say, &quot;If it weren’t for my horse, I wouldn’t have spent that year in college.&quot; Now, I'm gonna repeat that, because it bears repeating. &quot;If it weren't for my horse...&quot; as in, giddyup, giddyup, let's go — &quot;I wouldn't have spent that year in college,&quot; which is a degree-granting institution. Don't think about that too long, or BLOOD will shoot out your NOSE!" -- Lewis Black]]>

	    <![CDATA["There was a desert wind blowing that night. It was one of those hot dry Santa Anas that come down through the mountain passes and curl your hair and make your nerves jump and your skin itch. On nights like that every booze party ends in a fight. Meek little wives feel the edge of the carving knife and study their husbands' necks. Anything can happen. You can even get a full glass of beer at a cocktail lounge." -- Raymond Chandler]]>
