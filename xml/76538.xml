	    <![CDATA["When You Are Old&quot;


WHEN you are old and grey and full of sleep, 
And nodding by the fire, take down this book, 
And slowly read, and dream of the soft look 
Your eyes had once, and of their shadows deep; 
  
How many loved your moments of glad grace, 
And loved your beauty with love false or true, 
But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you, 
And loved the sorrows of your changing face; 
  
And bending down beside the glowing bars, 
Murmur, a little sadly, how Love fled 
And paced upon the mountains overhead 
And hid his face amid a crowd of stars." -- W.B. Yeats]]>

	    <![CDATA["How can I live without thee, how forgoe
Thy sweet Converse and Love so dearly joyn'd,
To live again in these wilde Woods forlorn? 
Should God create another Eve, and I
Another Rib afford, yet loss of thee
Would never from my heart; no no, I feel
The Link of Nature draw me: Flesh of Flesh,
Bone of my Bone thou art, and from thy State
Mine never shall be parted, bliss or woe." -- John Milton]]>

	    <![CDATA["O all fair lovers about the world,
There is none of you, none, that shall comfort me. 
My thoughts are as dead things, wrecked and whirled
Round and round in a gulf of the sea;
And still, through the sound and the straining stream,
Through the coil and chafe, they gleam in a dream,
The bright fine lips so cruelly curled, 
And strange swift eyes where the soul sits free." -- Algernon Charles Swinburne]]>

	    <![CDATA["Why did you betray your own heart Cathy? I have not one word of comfort. You deserve this. You have killed yourself. ... You loved me - then what right had you to leave me? Because ... nothing God or satan could inflict would have parted us, you, of you own will, did it. I have not broken your heart - you have broken it; and in breaking it, you have broken mine. So much the worse for me that I am strong. Do I want to live? What kind of living will it be when you - oh God! would you like to live with your soul in the grave? [...] I forgive what you have done to me. I love my murderer - but yours! How can I?" -- Emily Brontë]]>

Where is she? Not there—not in heaven—not perished—where? Oh! you said you cared nothing for my sufferings!

And I pray one prayer—I repeat it till my tongue stiffens—Catherine Earnshaw, may you not rest as long as I am living; you said I killed you—haunt me, then! The murdered do haunt their murderers, I believe. I know that ghosts have wandered on earth. Be with me always—take any form—drive me mad! only do not leave me in this abyss, where I cannot find you! Oh, God! it is unutterable! I cannot live without my life! I cannot live without my soul!" -- Emily Brontë]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["&lt;b&gt;To Solitude&lt;/b&gt;

O Solitude! if I must with thee dwell,  
  Let it not be among the jumbled heap  
  Of murky buildings; climb with me the steep,—  
Nature’s observatory—whence the dell,  
Its flowery slopes, its river’s crystal swell,         
  May seem a span; let me thy vigils keep  
  ’Mongst boughs pavillion’d, where the deer’s swift leap  
Startles the wild bee from the fox-glove bell.  
But though I’ll gladly trace these scenes with thee,  
  Yet the sweet converse of an innocent mind,         
Whose words are images of thoughts refin’d,  
  Is my soul’s pleasure; and it sure must be  
Almost the highest bliss of human-kind,  
  When to thy haunts two kindred spirits flee." -- John Keats]]>

And when you go to Ireland, with all that distance between us, I am afraid that this cord will be snapped, and I shall bleed inwardly." -- Charlotte Brontë]]>
