		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Hope and optimism are different. Optimism tends to be based on the notion that there's enough evidence out there to believe things are gonna be better, much more rational, deeply secular, whereas hope looks at the evidence and says, &quot;It doesn't look good at all. Doesn't look good at all. Gonna go beyond the evidence to create new possibilities based on visions that become contagious to allow people to engage in heroic actions always against the odds, no guarantee whatsoever.&quot; That's hope. I'm a prisoner of hope, though. Gonna die a prisoner of hope." -- Cornell West]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The country is in deep trouble.  We've forgotten that a rich life consists fundamentally of serving others, trying to leave the world a little better than you found it.  We need the courage to question the powers that be, the courage to be impatient with evil and patient with people, the courage to fight for social justice.  In many instances we will be stepping out on nothing, and just hoping to land on something.  But that's the struggle.  To live is to wrestle with despair, yet never allow despair to have the last word." -- Cornel West]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["White supremacist ideology is based first and foremost on the degradation of black bodies in order to control them. One of the best ways to instill fear in people is to terrorize them. Yet this fear is best sustained by convincing them that their bodies are ugly, their intellect is inherently underdeveloped, their culture is less civilized, and their future warrants less concern than that of other peoples." -- Cornel West]]>
