	    <![CDATA["Before I go on with this short history, let me make a general observationâ€“ the test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function.
One should, for example, be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise. This philosophy fitted on to my early adult life, when I saw the improbable, the implausible, often the &quot;impossible,&quot; come true." -- F. Scott Fitzgerald]]>
