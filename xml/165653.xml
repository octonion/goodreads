	    <![CDATA["Catch! calls the Once-ler.
He lets something fall.
It's a Truffula Seed.
It's the last one of all!
You're in charge of the last of the Truffula Seeds.
And Truffula Trees are what everyone needs.
Plant a new Truffula. Treat it with care.
Give it clean water. And feed it fresh air.
Grow a forest. Protect it from axes that hack.
Then the Lorax
and all of his friends
may come back." -- Dr. Seuss]]>

	    <![CDATA["All that is gold does not glitter,
Not all those who wander are lost;
The old that is strong does not wither,
Deep roots are not reached by the frost.

From the ashes a fire shall be woken,
A light from the shadows shall spring;
Renewed shall be blade that was broken,
The crownless again shall be king." -- J.R.R. Tolkien]]>

	    <![CDATA["Atticus said to Jem one day, &quot;I’d rather you shot at tin cans in the backyard, but I know you’ll go after birds.  Shoot all the blue jays you want, if you can hit ‘em, but remember it’s a sin to kill a mockingbird.&quot;  That was the only time I ever heard Atticus say it was a sin to do something, and I asked Miss Maudie about it.  &quot;Your father’s right,&quot; she said.  &quot;Mockingbirds don’t do one thing except make music for us to enjoy.  They don’t eat up people’s gardens, don’t nest in corn cribs, they don’t do one thing but sing their hearts out for us.  That’s why it’s a sin to kill a mockingbird." -- Harper Lee]]>
