		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Each night he must
 be carried through artificial tunnels and dream recurrent dreams.
Just as the ties recur beneath his train, these underlie
 his rushing brain.  He does not dare look out the window,
 for the third rail, the unbroken draught of poison,
 runs there beside him. He regards it as a disease
 he has inherited the susceptibility to.  He has to keep
 his hands in his pockets, as others must wear mufflers." -- Elizabeth Bishop]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["But he sleeps on the top of his mast
with his eyes closed tight.
The gull inquired into his dream,
which was, &quot;I must not fall.
The spangled sea below wants me to fall.
It is hard as diamonds; it wants to destroy us all." -- Elizabeth Bishop]]>

	    <![CDATA["I hate America. I hate this country. It’s just big ideas, and stories, and people dying, and people like you. The white cracker who wrote the national anthem knew what he was doing. He set the word 'free' to a note so high nobody can reach it. That was deliberate. Nothing on earth sounds less like freedom to me. You come to room 1013 over at the hospital, I'll show you America. Terminal, crazy and mean. I live in America, that’s hard enough, I don’t have to love it. You do that. Everybody’s got to love something." -- Tony Kushner]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Dreams were the worst. Of course I dreamed of food
and love, but they were pleasant rather 
than otherwise. But then I'd dream of things
like slitting a baby's throat, mistaking it
for a baby goat. I'd have
nightmares of other islands
stretching away from mine, infinities
of islands, islands spawning islands,
like frogs' eggs turning into polliwogs
of islands, knowing that I had to live
on each and every one, eventually,
for ages, registering their flora,
their fauna, their geography." -- Elizabeth Bishop]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Well I know Gyuri [the familiar diminutive of Georg or György], that human beings are unapproachable, that their souls are as far from each other as stars; only the remote radiance reaches to the other. I know that human beings are surrounded by dark, great seas, and thus they look across to one another, yearning but never reaching one another" -- Georg Lukács]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["To me, the ideological high wire 
is for fools to balance on with their illusions. 
It is better to leap into the void.
Isn't that what we all want anyway?—
to eliminate all pretense 
till like the oppressed who in the end
identifies with the oppressor, 
we accept the worst in ourselves 
and are set free." -- Ai]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I have this idea that every time we discover that the names we're being called are somehow keeping us less than free, we need to come up with new names for ourselves, and that the names we give ourselves must no longer reflect a fear of being labeled outsiders, must no longer bind us to a system that would rather see us dead." -- Kate Bornstein]]>
