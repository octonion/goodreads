		<description>
	    <![CDATA["In my opinion, if there is one extremely legitimate use for petroleum besides running wood chippers and front-end loaders to handle compost, it's making plastic for season extension.  It parks many of the trucks [for cross-country produce transportation].  With the trucks parked, greenhouses, tall tunnels, and more seasonal, localized eating, can we feed ourselves?  We still have to answer that burning question." -- Joel Salatin]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["That many if not most people...who want fresh leafy greens in January buy them at the supermarket after they've been bleached and plastic-bag shipped from California or beyond is not a tribute to modern technology; it's an unprecedented abdication of personal responsibility and a ubiquitous benchmark of abnormality." -- Joel Salatin]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I saw a news report recently that measured average video game use by American men between the ages of twenty-five and thirty-five: twenty hours per week.  Do you mean the flower of America's masculinity can't think of anything more important to do with twenty hours a week than sit in front of a video screen?  Folks, this ain't normal.  Can't we unplug already?" -- Joel Salatin]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["How many of us lobby for green energy or protected lands, but don't engage with the local bounty to lay by for tomorrow's unseasonal reality?  That we tend to not even think about this as a foundation for solutions in our food systems shows how quickly we want other people to solve these issues." -- Joel Salatin]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The same teen who can't legally operate a four-wheeler, or [ATV]...in a farm lane workplace environment can operate a jacked-up F-250 pickup on a crowded urban expressway.  By denying these [farm work] opportunities to bring value to their own lives and the community around them, we've relegated our young adults to teenage foolishness.  Then as a culture we walk around shaking our heads in bewilderment at these young people with retarded maturity.  Never in life do people have as much energy as in their teens, and to criminalize leveraging it is certainly one of our nation's greatest resource blunders." -- Joel Salatin]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["A farmer friend of mine told me recently about a busload of middle school children who came to his farm for a tour.  The first two boys off the bus asked, &quot;Where is the salsa tree?&quot;  They thought they could go pick salsa, like apples and peaches.  Oh my.  What do they put on SAT tests to measure this? Does anybody care? How little can a person know about food and still make educated decisions about it?  Is this knowledge going to change before they enter the voting booth? Now that's a scary thought." -- Joel Salatin]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Farms and food production should be, I submit, at least as important as who pierced their navel in Hollywood this week.  Please tell me I'm not the only one who believes this.  Please.  As a culture, we think we're well educated, but I'm not sure that what we've learned necessarily helps us survive." -- Joel Salatin]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Food security is not in the supermarket.  It's not in the government.  It's not at the emergency services division.  True food security is the historical normalcy of packing it in during the abundant times, building that in-house larder, and resting easy knowing that our little ones are not dependent on next week's farmers' market or the electronic cashiers at the supermarket." -- Joel Salatin]]>

	    <![CDATA["Read things you're sure will disagree with your current thinking. If you're a die-hard anti-animal person, read Meat.  If you're a die-hard global warming advocate, read Glenn Beck.  If you're a Rush Limbaugh fan, read James W. Loewen's Lies My Teachers Told Me.  It'll do your mind good and get your heart rate up." -- Joel Salatin]]>

	    <![CDATA["This magical, marvelous food on our plate, this sustenance we absorb, has a story to tell.  It has a journey.  It leaves a footprint.  It leaves a legacy.  To eat with reckless abandon, without conscience, without knowledge; folks, this ain't normal." -- Joel Salatin]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The first supermarket supposedly appeared on the American landscape in 1946.  That is not very long ago.  Until then, where was all the food?  Dear folks, the food was in homes, gardens, local fields, and forests.  It was near kitchens, near tables, near bedsides.  It was in the pantry, the cellar, the backyard." -- Joel Salatin]]>
