	    <![CDATA["I keep remembering of of my Guru's teachings about happiness. She says that people universally ten to think thta happiness is a stroke of luck, something that will maybe descend upon you like fine weather if you're fortunate enough. But that's not how happiness works. Happiness is the consequence of personal effort. You fight for it, strive for it, insist upon it, and sometimes even travel around the world looking for it. You have to participate relentlessly in the manifestations of your own blessings." -- Elizabeth Gilbert]]>
