		<description>
	    <![CDATA["One of the greatest myths in the world - &amp; the phrase 'greatest myths' is just a fancy way of saying 'big fat lies' -- is that troublesome things get less &amp; less troublesome if you do them more &amp; more. People say this myth when they are teaching children to ride bicycles, for instance, as though falling off a bicycle &amp; skinning your knee is less troublesome the fourteenth time you do it than it is the first time. The truth is that troublesome things tend to remain troublesome no matter how many times you do them, &amp; that you should avoid doing them unless they are absolutely urgent." -- Lemony Snicket]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["It is a curious thing, the death of a loved one. We all know that our time in this world is limited, and that eventually all of us will end up underneath some sheet, never to wake up. And yet it is always a surprise when it happens to someone we know. It is like walking up the stairs to your bedroom in the dark, and thinking there is one more stair than there is. Your foot falls down, through the air, and there is a sickly moment of dark surprise as you try and readjust the way you thought of things." -- Lemony Snicket]]>

Where many paths and errands meet.
And whither then? I cannot say" -- J.R.R. Tolkien]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything and your heart will be wrung and possibly broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact you must give it to no one, not even an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements. Lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket, safe, dark, motionless, airless, it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. To love is to be vulnerable." -- C.S. Lewis]]>
