		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The only way you can write the truth is to assume that what you set down will never be read. Not by any other person, and not even by yourself at some later date. Otherwise you begin excusing yourself. You must see the writing as emerging like a long scroll of ink from the index finger of your right hand; you must see your left hand erasing it." -- Margaret Atwood]]>

Except in this case I was all the parts: I was the lover on the platform, I was the lover on the train. And I was also the train." -- Lorrie Moore]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["[Baseball] breaks your heart. It is designed to break your heart. The game begins in the spring, when everything else begins again, and it blossoms in the summer, filling the afternoons and evenings, and then as soon as the chill rains come, it stops and leaves you to face the fall all alone. You count on it, rely on it to buffer the passage of time, to keep the memory of sunshine and high skies alive, and then just when the days are all twilight, when you need it most, it stops." -- A. Bartlett Giamatti]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The highly sensitive [introverted]  tend to be philosophical or spiritual in their orientation, rather than materialistic or hedonistic.  They dislike small talk.  They often describe themselves as creative or intuitive.  They dream vividly, and can often recall their dreams the next day.  They love music, nature, art, physical beauty. They feel exceptionally strong emotions--sometimes acute bouts of joy, but also sorrow, melancholy, and fear. Highly sensitive people also process information about their environments--both physical and emotional--unusually deeply.  They tend to notice subtleties that others miss--another person's shift in mood, say, or a lightbulb burning a touch too brightly." -- Susan Cain]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Introverts, in contrast, may have strong social skills and enjoy parties and business meetings, but after a while wish they were home in their pajamas. They prefer to devote their social energies to close friends, colleagues, and family. They listen more than they talk, think before they speak, and often feel as if they express themselves better in writing than in conversation. They tend to dislike conflict. Many have a horror of small talk, but enjoy deep discussions." -- Susan Cain]]>
