		<description>
	    <![CDATA["So we dream on.  Thus we invent our lives.  We give ourselves a sainted mother, we make our father a hero; and someone’s older brother and someone’s older sister – they become our heroes too.  We invent what we love and what we fear.  There is always a brave lost brother – and a little lost sister, too.  We dream on and on: the best hotel, the perfect family, the resort life.  And our dreams escape us almost as vividly as we can imagine them…  That’s what happens, like it or not.  And because that’s what happens, this is what we need: we need a good, smart bear…  Coach Bob knew it all along: you’ve got to get obsessed and stay obsessed. You have to keep passing the open windows." -- John Irving]]>

	    <![CDATA["How do people, like, not curse? How is it possible? There are these gaps in speech where you just have to put a &quot;fuck.&quot; I'll tell you who the most admirable people in the world are: newscasters. If that was me, I'd be like, &quot;And the motherfuckers flew the fucking plane right into the Twin Towers.&quot; How could you not, if you're a human being? Maybe they're not so admirable. Maybe they're robot zombies." -- Nick Hornby]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["My father took one hundred and thirty-two minutes to die.

I counted.

It happened on the Jellicoe Road. The prettiest road I’d ever seen, where trees made breezy canopies like a tunnel to Shangri-La. We were going to the ocean, hundreds of miles away, because I wanted to see the ocean and my father said that it was about time the four of us made that journey. I remember asking, 'What’s the difference between a trip and a journey?' and my father said, 'Narnie, my love, when we get there, you’ll understand,' and that was the last thing he ever said." -- Melina Marchetta]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["i think the idea of a 'mental health day' is something completely invented by people who have no clue what it's like to have bad mental health. the idea that your mind can be aired out in twenty-four hours is kind of like saying heart disease can be cured if you eat the right breakfast cereal. mental health days only exist for people who have the luxury of saying 'i don't want to deal with things today' and then can take the whole day off, while the rest of us are stuck fighting the fights we always fight, with no one really caring one way or another, unless we choose to bring a gun to school or ruin the morning announcements with a suicide." -- David Levithan]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I had no doubt that Tiny &lt;i&gt;thought&lt;/i&gt; he got depressed, but that was probably because he had nothing to compare it to. Still, what could I say? that I didn't just &lt;i&gt;feel&lt;/i&gt; depressed - instead, it was like the depression was the core of me, of every part of me, from my mind to my bones? That if he got blue, I got black? That I hated those pills so much because I knew how much I relied on them to live? 

No, I couldn't say any of this because when it all comes down to it, nobody wants to hear it. No matter how much they like you or love you, they don't want to hear it." -- John Green]]>
