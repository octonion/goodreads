	    <![CDATA["I cordially dislike allegory in all its manifestations, and always have done so since I grew old and wary enough to detect its presence.  I much prefer history – true or feigned– with its varied applicability to the thought and experience of readers.  I think that many confuse applicability with allegory, but the one resides in the freedom of the reader, and the other in the purposed domination of the author." -- J.R.R. Tolkien]]>

	    <![CDATA["I'm a scientist and I know what constitutes proof.  But the reason I call myself by my childhood name is to remind myself that a scientist must also be absolutely like a child.  If he sees a thing, he must say that he sees it, whether it was what he thought he was going to see or not.  See first, think later, then test.  But always see first.  Otherwise you will only see what you were expecting.  Most scientists forget that." -- Douglas Adams]]>
