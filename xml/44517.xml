	    <![CDATA["&lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; care for myself.  The more solitary, the more friendless, the more I will respect myself.  I will keep the law given by God;  sanctioned by man.  I will hold the principles received by me when I was sane, not mad -- as I am now.  Laws and principles are not for times when there is no temptation: they are for such moments as this, when body and soul rise in mutiny against their rigour; stringent are they; inviolate they shall be.  If at my individual convenience I might break them, what would be their worth? They have a worth -- so I have always believed; and if I cannot believe it now, it is because I am insane -- quite insane, with my veins running fire, and my heart beating faster than I can count its throbs.  Preconceived opinions, foregone determinations are all I have at this hour to stand; there I plant my foot." -- Charlotte Brontë]]>
