		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Was he willing to blend into the life of another human being for the rest of his days, and have hers blend into his?  That, of course, was the Bibleâ€™s bottom line on marriage: one flesh. Not separate entities, not two autonomous beings merely coming together at dinnertime or brushing past one another in the hallway, holding on to their singleness, guarding against invasion. One flesh!&quot; (p. 207)." -- Jan Karon]]>

	    <![CDATA["In his bachelor's heart of hearts, he loved pie with an intensity that alarmed him.  Yet, when he was offered seconds, he usually refused. &quot;Wouldn't you like another piece of this nice coconut pie, Father?&quot; he might be asked.  &quot;No, I don't believe I'd care for anymore,&quot; he'd say.  An outright lie!" -- Jan Karon]]>

	    <![CDATA["When his flock thronged into the midnight service, there was wonder on every face at the newly hung greens and the softly flickering candles on each windowsill. To the simple beauty of the historic church was added fresh, green hope, the lush scent of flowers in winter, and candle flame that cast its flickering shadows over the congregation like a shawl." -- Jan Karon]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I've got a lot to download on your mercy and grace.  I've always rushed up to You and dumped whatever it was and hurried away, fascinated by my own busyness.  I want to turn all this over to You slowly, carefully, examining every fragment as I pass it off, so there'll never be any question about it again.  Every time I've dumped and run, I've nearly always run back and snatched it out of Your hands.  Help me in this.......Right now, I'm certain of only one thing - that You love us, and that's where we all have to begin." -- Jan Karon]]>
