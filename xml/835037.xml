For all their show of reluctance, she had a sense that they enjoyed introducing her to these horrors, as seducers took pleasure in the corruption of innocence." -- Philip Sington]]>

	    <![CDATA["All writers are insecure, the male ones especially. It's well known. Why else would they spend so much time on make-believe? They're only happy in their imaginary worlds, because that's where they're in charge - where they're God. Did you know that Hemingway's mother dressed him as a girl until he was six years old?&quot;
I was not offended by Claudia's glib psychological theory. Like many glib psychological theories, it struck me as fundamentally correct." -- Philip Sington]]>
