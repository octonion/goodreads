	    <![CDATA["If you're trying to be miserable, it's important you don't have any goals.  No school goals, personal goals, family goals.  Your only objective each day should be to inhale and exhale for sixteen hours before you go to bed again.  Don't read anything informative, don't listen to anything useful, don't do anything productive.  If you start achieving goals, you might start to feel a sense of excitement, then you might want to set another goal, and then your miserable mornings are through.  To maintain your misery, the idea of crossing off your goals should never cross your mind." -- John Bytheway]]>
