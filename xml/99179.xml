	    <![CDATA["•	God is man squared. That is to say, God is man raised to a higher power.
•	Man is the root, the square root, of God.
•	We believe in the ideal (truth, wisdom, justice, honor, integrity, selflessness, sacrifice, compassion, goodness) and God is the name we give to that ideal.
•	What else is God but a heuristic for what we want to do with our lives?
•	The worship of God is the worship of perfection.  The perfection of space: infinity. The perfection of time: eternity. The perfection of power: omnipotence. The perfection of knowledge: omniscience. The perfection of behavior: virtue.
•	Since the Fall, falling is what we've learned to do.
•	We are blemished perfections.
•	Man is the asymptote of what he predicates God to be.

from &quot;Getting Godless&quot; in The Lice of Christ (MadHat Press 2014)." -- Bill Yarrow]]>
