		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["But love is always new. Regardless of whether we love once, twice, or a dozen times in our life, we always face a brand-new situation. Love can consign us to hell or to paradise, but it always takes us somewhere. We simply have to accept it, because it is what nourishes our existence. If we reject it, we die of hunger, because we lack the courage to stretch out a hand and pluck the fruit from the branches of the tree of life. We have to take love where we find it, even if that means hours, days, weeks of disappointment and sadness.
 
The moment we begin to seek love, love begins to seek us.  And to save us." -- Paulo Coelho]]>

	    <![CDATA["I wouldn't change it,&quot; Simon said. &quot;I wouldn't give up loving you. Not for anything.  You know what Raphael told me?  That I didn't know how to be a good vampire, that vampires accept that they're dead.  But as long as I remember what it was like to love you, I'll always feel like I'm alive." -- Cassandra Clare]]>

	    <![CDATA["But-&quot; Maia, still looking at Alec and Magnus, broke off and rasied her eyebrows. Simon turned to see what she was looking at - and stared.
Alec had his arms around Magnus and was kissing him full on the mouth. Magnus, who appeared to be in a state of shock, stood frozen. Several groups of people - Shadowhunters and Downworlders alike - were staring and whispering. Glancing to the side, Simon saw the Lightwoods, their eyes widen, gaping at the display. Maryse had her hand over her mouth.
Maia looked perplexed. &quot;Wait a second,&quot; she said. &quot;Do we all have to do that, too?" -- Cassandra Clare]]>
