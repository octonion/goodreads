	    <![CDATA["Though it seems like time itself moves more slowly when you're in the presence of people who actually see and hear you.  There's a certain weight to a moment that never comes when you feel invisible." -- Merrill Markoe]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["There were two things about Mama.  One is she always expected the best out of me.  And the other is that then no matter what I did, whatever I came home with, she acted like it was the moon I had just hung up in the sky and plugged in all the stars.  Like I was that good." -- Barbara Kingsolver]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The Buddhists say there are 149 ways to God. I'm not looking for God, only for myself, and that is far more complicated. God has had a great deal written about Him; nothing has been written about me. God is bigger, like my mother, easier to find, even in the dark. I could be anywhere, and since I can't describe myself I can't ask for help." -- Jeanette Winterson]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["And when I look at a history book and think of the imaginative effort it has taken to squeeze this oozing world between two boards and typeset, I am astonished.  Perhaps the event has an unassailable truth.  God saw it.  God knows.  But I am not God.  And so when someone tells me what they heard or saw, I believe them, and I believe their friend who also saw, but not in the same way, and I can put these accounts together and I will not have a seamless wonder but a sandwich laced with mustard of my own." -- Jeanette Winterson]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["If there is no god, what is left but science?  What is left to endow us with any grace?  You can tell me the chemical makeup of my skin and my brain, but how can you explain away my soul?  And if there is no god to watch over me, chastise me, grieve for me, rejoice for me, make me fear, and make me wonder, what am I but a collection of metals and liquids with nothing to celebrate about my daily living?" -- Sharon Shinn]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["All that is gold does not glitter,
Not all those who wander are lost;
The old that is strong does not wither,
Deep roots are not reached by the frost.

From the ashes a fire shall be woken,
A light from the shadows shall spring;
Renewed shall be blade that was broken,
The crownless again shall be king." -- J.R.R. Tolkien]]>
