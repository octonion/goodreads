		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Satan has control now. No matter where you look, he is in control, even in our own land. He is guiding the governments as far as the Lord will permit him. That is why there is so much strife, turmoil, and confusion all
over the earth. One master mind is governing the nations. It is not the president of the United States; it is
not Hitler; it is not Mussolini; it is not the king or government of England or any other land; it is Satan
himself." -- Joseph Fielding Smith]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Our world is in turmoil. It is aging toward senility. It is
very ill. Long ago it was born with brilliant prospects. It
was baptized by water, and its sins were washed away. It
was never baptized by fire, for that is still to come. It has
had shorter periods of good health, but longer ones of
ailing. Most of the time there have been pains and aches
in some parts of its anatomy, but now that it is growing
old, complications have set in, and all the ailments seem
to be everywhere.
The world has been ‘cliniced,’ and the complex
diseases have been catalogued. The physicians have had
summit consultations, and temporary salve has been
rubbed on afflicted parts, but it has only postponed the
fatal day and never cured it. It seems that while remedies
have been applied, staph infection has set in, and the
patient’s suffering intensified. His mind is wandering. It
cannot remember its previous illnesses nor the cure
which was applied. The political physicians through the
ages have rejected suggested remedies as unprofessional
since they came from lowly prophets. Man being what
he is with tendencies such as he has, results can be
prognosticated with some degree of accuracy." -- Spencer W Kimball]]>

It will all come into your mind with the very first words: the sights you saw in that place, what it smelled like, the ice cream you ate while you were reading it... yes, books are like flypaper—memories cling to the printed page better than anything else." -- Cornelia Funke]]>
