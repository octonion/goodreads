	    <![CDATA["She liked being reminded of butterflies.  She remembered being six or seven and crying over the fates of the butterflies in her yard after learning that they lived for only a few days.  Her mother had comforted her and told her not to be sad for the butterflies, that just because their lives were short didn't mean they were tragic.  Watching them flying in the warm sun among the daisies in their garden, her mother had said to her, see, they have a beautiful life.  Alice liked remembering that." -- Lisa Genova]]>

	    <![CDATA["It occurs to me that she is not unique--that all women compare lives.  We are aware of whose husband works more, who helps more around the house, who makes more money, who is having more sex.  We compare our children, taking note of who is sleeping through the night, eating their vegetables, minding their manners, getting into the right schools.  We know who keeps the best house, throws the best parties, cooks the best meals, has the best tennis game.  We know who among us is the smartest, has the fewest lines around her eyes, has the best figure--whether naturally or artificially.  We are aware of who works full-time, who stays at home with the kids, who manages to do it all and make it look easy, who shops and lunches while the nanny does it all.  We digest it all and then discuss with our friends.  Comparing and then confiding; it is what women do.
The difference, I think, lies in why we do it.  Are we doing it to gauge our own life and reassure ourselves that we fall within the realm of normal? Or are we being competitive, relishing others' shortcomings so that we can win, if only by default?" -- Emily Giffin]]>
