The writer has to force himself to work He has to make his own hours and if he doesn't go to his desk at all there is nobody to scold him...A person is a fool to become a writer. His only compensation is absolute freedom. He has no master except his own soul, and that, I am sure, is why he does it." -- Roald Dahl]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["He knew why he wanted to kiss her. Because she was beautiful. And before that, because she was kind. And before that, because she was smart and funny. Because she was exactly the right kind of smart and funny. Because he could imagine taking a long trip with her without ever getting bored. Because whenever he saw something new and interesting, or new and ridiculous, he always wondered what she'd have to say about it--how many stars she'd give it and why." -- Rainbow Rowell]]>

	    <![CDATA["There's never been a moment,' he barely said, 'when I didn't recognize you.'
She wiped her eyes.  Her mascara smeared.  He nudged the merry-to-round into motion.  He could kiss her now.  If he wanted.
'I'd know you in the dark,' he said.  'From a thousand miles away.  There's nothing you could become that I haven't already fallen in love with.'
He could kiss her.
'I know you,' he said." -- Rainbow Rowell]]>

&quot;It was good enough for me.&quot;

&quot;Then why have you been trying so hard to change it?" -- Rainbow Rowell]]>
