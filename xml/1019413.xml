		<description>
	    <![CDATA["When I knew I couldn't suffer another moment of pain, and tears fell on my bloody bindings, my mother spoke softly into my ear, encouraging me to go one more hour, one more day, one more week, reminding me of the rewards I would have if I carried on a little longer. In this way, she taught me how to endure â€” not just the physical trials of footbinding and childbearing but the more torturous pain of the heart, mind, and soul." -- Lisa See]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Still everyone, including the abbot, had said that he was running away from his grief. They'd had no idea what they were talking about. He'd cradled his grief, almost to the point of loving it. For so long he refused to give it up, because leaving it behind was like leaving her." -- Sue Monk Kidd]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Then it dawned on me that men throughout the country had to know about nu shu (women's written word).  How could they not?  They wore it on their embroidered shoes.  They saw us weaving our messages into cloth. They heard us singing our songs and showing off our third-day wedding books.  Men just considered our writing beneath them.

It is said men have the hearts of iron, while women are made of water.  This comes through men's writing and women's writing.  Men's writing has more than 50,000 characters, each uniquely different, each with deep meanings and nuances.  Our women's writing has 600 characters, which we use phonetically, like babies to create about 10,000 words.  Men's writing takes a lifetime to learn and understand.  Women's writing is something we pick up as girls, and we rely on the context to coax meaning.  Men write about the outer realm of literature, accounts, and crop yields; women write about the inner realm of children, daily chores, and emotions.  The men in the Lu household were proud of their wives' fluency in nu shu and dexterity in embroidery, though these things had as much importance to survival as a pig's fart." -- Lisa See]]>
