	    <![CDATA["Fiction is dangerous because it lets you into other people's heads. It shows you that the world doesn't have to be like the one you live in.&quot; At the first nationally recognized science fiction convention in China in 2007, Gaiman took a party official aside and said, &quot;While not actually illegal, science fiction is regarded as dangerous and subversive in China. Why did you say yes to a science-fiction convention?&quot;
The party official answered, &quot;In China, we're really good at making things people bring to us, but we don't invent, we don't innovate.&quot; When Chinese party officials visited Google, Apple and Microsoft, they asked what the executives read as children. The official continued: &quot;They all said, 'We read science fiction. The world doesn't have to be the way it is right now. We can change it.' &quot; &quot;That,&quot; said Gaiman, &quot;is the big dangerous thing." -- Neil Gaiman]]>

	    <![CDATA["Do you really think you'd win a PR war against a bunch of committed librarians?' He thought about this, but he knew I was right. The libraries were a treasured institution and so central to everyday life that government and commerce rarely did anything that might upset them.Some say they were more powerful than the military, or, if not, they were certainly quieter. As they say: Don't mess with librarians.
Only they use a stronger word than 'mess'..." -- Jasper Fforde]]>
