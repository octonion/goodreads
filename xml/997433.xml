	    <![CDATA["I'm going to come back to West Virginia when this is over. There's something ancient and deeply-rooted in my soul. I like to think that I have left my ghost up one of those hollows, and I'll never really be able to leave for good until I find it. And I don't want to look for it, because I might find it and have to leave.&quot; - from a letter to his mother Helen Pancake that Breece wrote in Charlottesville, where he was studying writing." -- Breece D'J Pancake]]>
