	    <![CDATA["The man who is extremely and dangerously hungry has no other interest but food. Capacities not useful for the satisfying of hunger are pushed into the background. 'But what happens to man's desires when there is plenty of food and his belly in chronically filled? At once, other (and higher) needs emerge and these, rather than the psychological hungers, dominate the organism." -- Betty Friedan]]>

	    <![CDATA["Mrs. Landingham, does the President have free time this morning? 

The President has nothing but free time, Toby. Right now he's in the residence eating Cheerios and enjoying Regis and Kathie Lee. Should I get him for you? 

Sarcasm's a disturbing thing coming from a woman of your age, Mrs. Landingham. 

What age would that be, Toby? 

Late twenties? 

Atta boy." -- Aaron Sorkin]]>
