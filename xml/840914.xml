	    <![CDATA["Bjartur declared that he had never denied that there was much that was strange in nature. &quot;I consider that there's nothing wrong in believing in elves even though their names aren't on the parish register,&quot; he said. &quot;It hurts no one, yes and even does you good rather than harm; but to believe in ghosts and ghouls--that I contend is nothing but the remains of popery and hardly fit for a Christian to give even a moment's consideration.&quot; He did his utmost to persuade the women to accept his views on these matters." -- Halldor Laxness]]>
