	    <![CDATA["I think all of us are looking for that which does not admit of bullshit . . . If you tell me you can bench press 450, hell, we'll load up the bar and put you under it. Either you can do it or you can't do itâ€”you can't bullshit. Ultimately, sports are just about as close to what one would call the truth as it is possible to get in this world." -- Harry Crews]]>

	    <![CDATA["The president of the United States has claimed, on more than one occasion, to be in dialogue with God. If he said that he was talking to God through his hairdryer, this would precipitate a national emergency. I fail to see how the addition of a hairdryer makes the claim more ridiculous or offensive." -- Sam Harris]]>

	    <![CDATA["We are going to die, and that makes us the lucky ones. Most people are never going to die because they are never going to be born. The potential people who could have been here in my place but who will in fact never see the light of day outnumber the sand grains of Arabia. Certainly those unborn ghosts include greater poets than Keats, scientists greater than Newton. We know this because the set of possible people allowed by our DNA so massively exceeds the set of actual people. In the teeth of these stupefying odds it is you and I, in our ordinariness, that are here.We privileged few, who won the lottery of birth against all odds, how dare we whine at our inevitable return to that prior state from which the vast majority have never stirred?" -- Richard Dawkins]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I believe that the universe was formed around 15 billion years ago and that humans have evolved from their apelike ancestors over the past few million years.  I believe we are more likely to live a good life if all humans try to work together in a world community, preserving planet earth.  When decisions for groups are made in this world, I believe that the democratic process should be used.  To protect the individual, I believe in freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of religion, freedom from religion, freedom of inquiry, and a wall of separation between church and state.  When making decisions about what is right or wrong, I believe I should use my intelligence to reason about the likely consequences of my actions.  I believe that I should try to increase the happiness of everyone by caring for other people and finding ways to cooperate.  Never should my actions discriminate against people simply because of their race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, age, or national origin.  I believe that ideas about what is right and wrong will change with education, so I am prepared to continually question ideas using evidence from experience and science.  I believe there is no valid evidence to support claims for the existence of supernatural entities and deities.  I will use these beliefs to guide my thinking and my actions until I find good reasons for revising them or replacing them with other beliefs that are more valid." -- Ronald P. Carver]]>
