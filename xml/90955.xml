&quot;I am,&quot; he said. He was staring at me, and I could see the corners of his eyes crinkling. &quot;I'm in love with you, and I'm not in the business of denying myself the simple pleasure of saying true things. I'm in love with you, and I know that love is just a shout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that we're all doomed and that there will come a day when all our labor has been returned to dust, and I know the sun will swallow the only earth we'll ever have, and I am in love with you." -- John Green]]>

&quot;You do care,&quot; said Dumbledore. He had not flinched or made a single move to stop Harry demolishing his office. His expression was calm, almost detached. &quot;You care so much you feel as though you will bleed to death with the pain of it." -- J.K. Rowling]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["What is an &quot;instant&quot; death anyway? How long is an instant? Is it one second? Ten? The pain of those seconds must have been awful as her heart burst and her lungs collapsed and there was no air and no blood to her brain and only raw panic. What the hell is instant? Nothing is instant. Instant rice takes five minutes, instant pudding an hour. I doubt that an instant of blinding pain feels particularly instantaneous." -- John Green]]>

	    <![CDATA["You guessed? You must have been pretty sure, considering you could have killed me.&quot;
&quot;I was ninety percent sure.&quot;
&quot;I see,&quot; Clary said. There must have been something in her voice, because he turned to look at her. Her hand cracked across his face, a slap that rocked him back on his heels. He put his hands on his cheek, more in surprise than pain.
&quot;What the hell was that for?&quot;
&quot;The other ten percent." -- Cassandra Clare]]>
