Ron and Hermione both roared with laughter. Harry ignored them.
What did you tell her?&quot;
I told her it's a Hungarian Horntail,&quot; said Ginny, turning a page of the newspaper idly. &quot;Much more macho.&quot;
Thanks,&quot; said Harry, grinning. &quot;And what did you tell her Ron’s got?&quot;
A Pygmy Puff, but I didn’t say where." -- J.K. Rowling]]>

&quot;As if you aren't.&quot;
&quot;Excuse me?&quot;
&quot;Really Barrons,&quot; I said drily. &quot;I'm not the only one who didn't just not have that conversation, and you know it.&quot;

	    <![CDATA["I love books, by the way, way more than movies. Movies tell you what to think. A good book lets you choose a few thoughts for yourself. Movies show you the pink house. A good book tells you there's a pink house and lets you paint some of the finishing touches, maybe choose the roof style,park your own car out front. My imagination has always topped anything a movie could come up with. Case in point, those darned Harry Potter movies. That was so not what that part-Veela-chick, Fleur Delacour, looked like." -- Karen Marie Moning]]>
