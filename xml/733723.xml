		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Brod's life was a slow realization that the world was not for her, and that for whatever reason, she would never be happy and honest at the same time.  She felt as if she were brimming, always producing and hoarding more love inside her.  But there was no release...

So she had to satisfy herself with the idea of love--loving the loving of things whose existence she didn't care at all about.  Love itself became the object of her love.  She loved herself in love, she loved loving love, as love loves loving, and was able, in that way, to reconcile herself with a world that fell so short of what she would have hoped for.  It was not the world that was the great and saving lie, but her willingness to make it beautiful and fair, to live a once-removed life, in a world once-removed from the one in which everyone else seemed to exist." -- Jonathan Safran Foer]]>
