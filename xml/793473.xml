		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The hardest thing about adolescence is that everything seems too big.  There's no way to get context or perspective, ..... Pain and joy without limits.  No one can live like that forever, so experience finally comes to our rescue.  We come to know what we can endure, and also that nothing endures." -- Sara Paretsky]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,
To the last syllable of recorded time;
And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!
Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player,
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,
And then is heard no more. It is a tale
Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
Signifying nothing." -- William Shakespeare]]>
