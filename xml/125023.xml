I do not carry a sickle or scythe.
I only wear a hooded black robe when it's cold.
And I don't have those skull-like facial features you seem to enjoy pinning on me from a distance. You want to know what I truly look like? I'll help you out. Find yourself a mirror while I continue." -- Markus Zusak]]>

	    <![CDATA["Nately was instantly up in arms again.  &quot;There is nothing so absurd about risking your life for your country!&quot; he declared.

&quot;Isn't there?&quot; asked the old man.  &quot;What is a country?  A country is a piece of land surrounded on all sides by boundaries, usually unnatural.  Englishmen are dying for England, Americans are dying for America, Germans are dying for Germany, Russians are dying for Russia.  There are now fifty or sixty countries fighting in this war.  Surely so many countries can't all be worth dying for.&quot;

&quot;Anything worth living for,&quot; said Nately, &quot;is worth dying for.&quot;

&quot;And anything worth dying for,&quot; answered the sacrilegious old man, &quot;is certainly worth living for." -- Joseph Heller]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Eleanor looked up, surprised; the little girl was sliding back in her chair, sullenly refusing her milk, while her father frowned and her brother giggled and her mother said calmly, 'She wants her cup of stars.'

Indeed yes, Eleanor thought; indeed, so do I; a cup of stars, of course.

'Her little cup,' the mother was explaining, smiling apologetically at the waitress, who was thunderstruck at the thought that the mill's good country milk was not rich enough for the little girl. 'It has stars in the bottom, and she always drinks her milk from it at home. She calls it her cup of stars because she can see the stars while she drinks her milk.' The waitress nodded, unconvinced, and the mother told the little girl, 'You'll have your milk from your cup of stars tonight when we get home. But just for now, just to be a very good little girl, will you take a little milk from this glass?'

Don't do it, Eleanor told the little girl; insist on your cup of stars; once they have trapped you into being like everyone else you will never see your cup of stars again; don't do it; and the little girl glanced at her, and smiled a little subtle, dimpling, wholly comprehending smile, and shook her head stubbornly at the glass. Brave girl, Eleanor thought; wise, brave girl." -- Shirley Jackson]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["No live organism can continue for long to exist sanely under conditions of absolute reality; even larks and katydids are supposed, by some, to dream. Hill House, not sane, stood by itself against its hills, holding darkness within; it had stood so for eighty years and might stand for eighty more. Within, walls continued upright, bricks met neatly, floors were firm, and doors were sensibly shut; silence lay steadily against the wood and stone of Hill House, and whatever walked there, walked alone." -- Shirley Jackson]]>

To forget time, to forget life, to be at peace. You can help me. You can open for me the portals of death's house, for love is always with you, and love is stronger than death is." -- Oscar Wilde]]>
