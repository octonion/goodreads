		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Did we have sex?&quot; he asked directly.
For about two minutes, this might actually be fun. &quot;Eric,&quot; I said, &quot;we had sex in every position I could imagine, and some I couldn’t. We had sex in every room in my house, and we had sex outdoors. You told me it was the best you’d ever had.&quot; (At the time he couldn’t recall all the sex he’d ever had. But he’d paid me a compliment.) &quot;Too bad you can’t remember it,&quot; I concluded with a modest smile.
Eric looked like I’d hit him in the forehead with a mallet. For all of thirty seconds his reaction was completely gratifying." -- Charlaine Harris]]>

	    <![CDATA["By the way, I haven't heard an 'I'm sorry' from you yet.&quot; My sense of grievance had overwhelmed my sense of self-preservation.
I am sorry that the maenad picked on you.&quot;
I glared at him. &quot;Not enough,&quot; I said. I was trying hard to hang on to this conversation.
Angelic Sookie, vision of love and beauty, I am prostrate that the wicked evil maenad violated your smooth and voluptuous body, in an attempt to deliver a message to me.&quot;
That's more like it." -- Charlaine Harris]]>
