	    <![CDATA["The best attitude to take toward back talk is to reach out and embrace it with love, compassion, and understanding.  No need to criticize it for its shortcomings or to waste time in recriminations.  Just give a loving nod and a hug to any back talk you get, and move on to the joyful creation of your fulfilled life. " -- Gay Hendricks]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The time has come to tell the truth. Again. There is no love without justice. Men and women who cannot be just deny themselves and everyone they choose to be intimate with the freedom to know mutual love. If we remain unable to imagine a world where love can be recognized as a unifying principle that can lead us to seek and use power wisely, then we will remain wedded to a culture of domination that requires us to choose power over love." -- bell hooks]]>
