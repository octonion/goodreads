	    <![CDATA["The moral duty of the free writer is to begin his work at home: to be a critic of his own community, his own country, his own government, his own culture. The more freedom the writer possesses, the greater the moral obligation to play the role of critic." -- Edward Abbey]]>

	    <![CDATA["There's a black Mercedes rollin' through the combat zone 

Your servants are half dead; you're down to the bone

Tell me, tall man, where would you like to be overthrown

Maybe down in Jerusalem or Argentina?

Angelina" -- Bob Dylan]]>

	    <![CDATA["Disorder in the house 
The doors are coming off the hinges 
The earth will open and swallow up the real estate

I just got my paycheck 
I'm gonna paint the whole town grey 
Whether it's a night in Paris or a Fresno matinee 

It's the home of the brave and the land of the free
Where the less you know the better off you'll be" -- Warren Zevon]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The [wild animal:] shall not be measured by man. In a world older and more complete, gifted with extensions of the senses we have lost or never attained, living by voices we shall never hear. They are not brethren, they are not underlings; they are other nations, caught with ourselves in the net of life and time, fellow prisoners of the splendour and the travail of the Earth." -- Henry Beston]]>
