	    <![CDATA["Happiness is always a by-product. It is probably a matter of temperament, and for anything I know it may be glandular. But it is not something that can be demanded from life, and if you are not happy you had better stop worrying about it and see what treasures you can pluck from your own brand of unhappiness." -- Robertson Davies]]>

	    <![CDATA["I object to being told that I am saving daylight when my reason tells me that I am doing nothing of the kind...
