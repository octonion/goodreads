		<description>
	    <![CDATA["People use drugs, legal and illegal, because their lives are intolerably painful or dull.  They hate their work and find no rest in their leisure.  They are estranged from their families and their neighbors.  It should tell us something that in healthy societies drug use is celebrative, convivial, and occasional, whereas among us it is lonely, shameful, and addictive.  We need drugs, apparently, because we have lost each other." -- Wendell Berry]]>

The last was an awful blank, something like then world when the deluge was gone by." -- Charlotte Brontë]]>

Wait without thought, for you are not ready for thought: So the darkness shall be the light, and the stillness the dancing." -- T.S. Eliot]]>
