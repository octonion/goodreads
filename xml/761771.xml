	    <![CDATA["Yet for all the depression no one ever quit.  When someone quit, we couldn't believe it. 'I'm becoming a rafting instructor on the Colorado River,' they said.  'I'm touring college towns with my garage band.'  We were dumbfounded. It was like they were from another planet.  Where had they found the derring-do?  What would they do about car payments?  We got together for going away drinks on their final day and tried to hide our envy while reminding ourselves that we still had the freedom and luxury to shop indiscriminately." -- Joshua Ferris]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["By using money as the scapegoat and work as our all-consuming routine, we are able to conveniently disallow ourselves to do otherwise: 'John, I'd love to talk about the gaping void I feel in my life, the hopelessness that hits me like a punch in the eye every time I start my computer in the morning, but I have so much work to do!  I've got at least three hours of unimportant email to reply to before calling prospects who said 'no' yesterday.  Gotta run!" -- Timothy Ferriss]]>
