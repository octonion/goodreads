	    <![CDATA["And I just couldn't take it anymore. I closed the distance between us, slammed him back against the chair and kissed him, holding his head still with both my hands buried in that stupid, stupid hair. I half expected more resistance, because Pritkin had never met an argument he didn't like. So it was a shock when he ran his hands down my sides, cupped my hips and slid us both to the floor.
&quot;I'm going straight to hell for this,&quot; he muttered.
&quot;At least you'll know a lot of people,&quot; I said breathlessly. " -- Karen Chance]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["He smiled at that, and then his gaze shifted to a spot over my shoulder and it faded. 'These doubts wouldn’t have anything to do with the company you’re keeping of late, would they?'
I didn’t get a chance to answer before the shop door was thrown open and a furious war mage stomped in. Pritkin spotted me and his eyes narrowed.
'You shaved my legs?!'
Mircea looked at me and folded his arms across his chest. I looked from one unhappy face to the other and suddenly remembered that I had somewhere else to be." -- Karen Chance]]>

	    <![CDATA["Not really hungry.&quot;
&quot;She’ll eat.&quot; Pritkin said curtly.

&quot;I eat plenty.&quot;
&quot;The same does not apply should I strangle you in understandable irritation, however.&quot;
&quot;I’ll have a sandwich,&quot; I told Nick. &quot;No meat." -- Karen Chance]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Once upon a time, when I was a child reading fairy tales, I'd ached to have my own adventures.  Not that I'd wanted to be some dippy heroine languishing in a tower, awaiting rescue.  No, I'd wanted to be the knight, charging into battle against overwhelming odds, or the plucky country lass who gets taken on as an apprentice to a great wizard. As I got older, I'd found out the hard way that adventures are rarely anything like the books say.  Half the time you are scared out of your mind, and the rest you're bored and your feet hurt.  I was beginning to believe that maybe I wasn't the adventurous type." -- Karen Chance]]>

	    <![CDATA["Pritkin gave me a little shake and I eyed him without favor.  The only other occasions when I had been dragged back in time, the trip had been triggered by proximity to a person whose past was being threatened.  
I have to tell you,” I said frankly, “if someone is trying to mess with your conception or something, I’m not feeling a pressing need to intervene." -- Karen Chance]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["And even then, it's not like you did all that much,&quot; I said, talking over him, because it was the only way to get a word in edgeways with Pritkin sometimes.
He had filched the bottle back to take a drink, but at that he lowered it and looked at me, his eyes very green next to the amber liquor. &quot;What?&quot;
&quot;I just meant, it wasn't all that and a bag of chips. You know?&quot;
He blinked at me.
&quot;No offense,&quot; I added, because he was looking kind of poleaxed. Like maybe he hadn't had a whole lot of complaints before. Which was, frankly, pretty damn understandable. But I feigned indifference. &quot;I mean, it couldn't have been that bad if -&quot;
&quot;Bad?&quot;
&quot;Well, not bad bad.&quot;
He just looked at me.
&quot;I mean, I came and everything, so that has to count for some -&quot;
I cut off because I was suddenly enveloped in a strong pair of arms, and my head was crushed to a hard chest. A chest that appeared to be vibrating. It took me a few moments to get it, and even then I wasn't so sure, because Pritkin's face was buried in my hair. But I kind of thought - as impossible as it seemed - that he might be ... laughing?" -- Karen Chance]]>
