	    <![CDATA["Never love a wild thing, Mr. Bell,' Holly advised him. 'That was Doc's mistake. He was always lugging home wild things. A hawk with a hurt wing. One time it was a full-grown bobcat with a broken leg. But you can't give your heart to a wild thing: the more you do, the stronger they get. Until they're strong enough to run into the woods. Or fly into a tree. Then a taller tree. Then the sky. That's how you'll end up, Mr. Bell. If you let yourself love a wild thing. You'll end up looking at the sky.&quot;
&quot;She's drunk,&quot; Joe Bell informed me. 
&quot;Moderately,&quot; Holly confessed....Holly lifted her martini. &quot;Let's wish the Doc luck, too,&quot; she said, touching her glass against mine. &quot;Good luck: and believe me, dearest Doc -- it's better to look at the sky than live there. Such an empty place; so vague. Just a country where the thunder goes and things disappear." -- Truman Capote]]>
