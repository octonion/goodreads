	    <![CDATA["If we look back into history for the character of present sects in Christianity, we shall find few that have not in their turns been persecutors, and complainers of persecution. The primitive Christians thought persecution extremely wrong in the Pagans, but practised it on one another. The first Protestants of the Church of England, blamed persecution in the Roman church, but practised it against the Puritans: these found it wrong in the Bishops, but fell into the same practice themselves both here and in New England.

	    <![CDATA["The problem with being too busy to read is that you learn by experience... ie: the hard way.  By reading, you learn through other's experiences, generally a better way to do business, especially in our line of work, where the consequences of incompetence are so final for young men.  Thanks to my reading, I've never been caught flatfooted by any situation...It doesn't give me all the answers, but it lights what is so often a dark path ahead." -- James N. Mattis]]>

A light from the shadows shall spring;
Renewed shall be blade that was broken,
The crownless again shall be king." -- J.R.R. Tolkien]]>
