		<description>
	    <![CDATA["There was a dragon who had a long-standing obsession with a queen's breasts,&quot; she said, growing breathless. &quot;The dragon knew the penalty to touch her would mean death, yet he revealed his secret desire to the king's chief doctor. This man promised he could arrange for the dragon to satisfy his desire, but it would cost him one thousand gold coins.&quot; She spread her soapy hands over his nipples, then down his arms. &quot;Though he didn't have the money, the dragon readily agreed to the scheme.&quot;

Grace,&quot; Darius moaned, his erection straining against her stomach.

She hid her smile, loving that she had this much power over such a strong man. That she, Grace Carlyle, made him ache with longing. &quot;The next day the physician made a batch of itching powder and poured some into the queen's bra… uh, you might call it a brassiere… while she bathed. After she dressed, she began itching and itching and itching. The physician was summoned to the Royal Chambers, and he informed the king and queen that only a special saliva, if applied for several hours, would cure this type of itch. And only a dragon possessed this special saliva.&quot; Out of breath, she paused.

Continue,&quot; Darius said. His arms wound around her so tightly she could barely breathe. His skin blazed hot against hers, hotter than even the steamy water.

Are you sure?&quot;

Continue.&quot; Taut lines bracketed his mouth.

Well, the king summoned the dragon. Meanwhile, the physician slipped him the antidote for the itching powder, which the dragon put into his mouth, and for the next few hours, the dragon worked passionately on the queen's breasts.

Anyway,&quot; she said, reaching around him and lathering the muscled mounds of his butt, &quot;the queen's itching was eventually relieved, and the dragon left satisfied and touted as a hero.&quot;

This does not sound like a joke,&quot; Darius said.

I'm getting to the punch line. Hang on. When the physician demanded his payment, the now satisfied dragon refused. He knew that the physician could never report what really happened to the king. So the next day, the physician slipped a massive dose of the same itching powder into the king's loincloth. And the king immediately summoned the dragon.&quot;
-Heart of the Dragon" -- Gena Showalter]]>

You’ll have zealots pimping this god or that on the one hand, scientists pimping Darwin on the other, and then practical people pointing at written language and saying, look, fellas, the reason those ideas have gone viral is because someone figured out how to write them down." -- Kevin Hearne]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["That's the famous vampire Helgarson you're riding with, isn't it?  Is he fond of lattes?&quot;
&quot;I don't know.&quot; I looked over at Leif, who was grinning-he was hearing both sides of the conversation, of course-and said, &quot;Malina wants to know if you like lattes, and I want to know if you're famous.&quot;
&quot;No to both,&quot; he said, as we screamed onto the 202 on-ramp.
&quot;Sorry, Malina,&quot; I said to the phone. &quot;He's not famous.&quot;
&quot;Perhaps it would be better to call infamous.  It is irrelevant at this point.  What is relevant is that my sisters and I are not great warriors.  Were the odds even and they did not cheat with modern weapons, I would say, yes, we could walk in and win a magical battle against most opponents.  But we are outnumbered more than three to one.&quot;
&quot;How many are there?&quot;
&quot;Twenty-two.  Some of them have firearms, but they are not great warriors either.  And while they may be expecting you, Mr. O'Sullivan, they will not be expecting Mr. Helgarson to get involved.  I imagine the two of you together will be quite formidable.&quot;
