		<description>
	    <![CDATA["...the years have taught me not to wonder too much at the dark things men do.  Strange how it is that men never act crueller than when they're fighting for the sake of an idea.  We've been killing since Cain over who stands closer to god.  It seems to me that cruelty is just in the way of things.  You drive yourself mad if you take it all personal.  Those who hurt you don't have the power over you they would like.  That's why they do what they do.  And I'm not going to give them the power now.  But it was a cruel thing that they did, and when they had finished hurting me, a splinter of loneliness seemed to break off and stay inside me forever." -- Marcel Theroux]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["As far as I can figure, the way that it works is this: everyone has something that happened to them. The thing that we each carry. And you can see it in people, if you look. See it in the way someone walks, in the way someone takes a compliment, sometimes you can just see it in someone’s eyes. In one moment of desperation, of fear, in one quick moment you can see that thing that happened. Everyone has it. The thing that keeps you up at night, or makes you not trust people, or stops love. The thing that hurts. And to stop it, to stop the hurt, you have to turn it into a story. And not just a story you play over and over for yourself, but a story that you tell. A story’s not a story unless you tell it. And once you tell it, it’s not yours anymore. You give it away. And once you give it away, it’s not something that hurts you anymore, it’s something that helps everyone who hears it. It’s the kind of thing that’s hard to explain. It’s probably best if we just show you how it works." -- daniel macivor]]>
