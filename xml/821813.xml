	    <![CDATA["The faculty member is the student’s natural enemy and if he lets down his guard he is sorry for it later, has a conscience crisis, and feels he has to turn you in. Unless he has prejudiced his own case so badly that he doesn’t wish to call administrative attention to what now appears to be a mutual folly; in this case sullen silence ensues. You may have been teacher’s pet before the weekend, but try to get an A in the course after Monday. Just try it. This is known as academic integrity." -- Elizabeth Savage]]>
