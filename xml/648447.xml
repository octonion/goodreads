		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I often find that a novel, even a well-written and compelling novel, can become a blur to me soon after I've finished reading it.  I recollect perfectly the feeling of reading it, the mood I occupied, but I am less sure about the narrative details.  It is almost as if the book were, as Wittgenstein said of his propositions, a ladder to be climbed and then discarded after it has served its purpose." -- Sven Birkerts]]>

	    <![CDATA["If you and I are to live religious lives, it mustn't be that we talk a lot about religion, but that our manner of life is different. It is my belief that only if you try to be helpful to other people will you in the end find your way to God." -- Ludwig Wittgenstein]]>
