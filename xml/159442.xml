	    <![CDATA["I appear at times merry and in good heart, talk, too,before others quite reasonably, and it looks as tho I felt, too, God knows how well within my skin. Yet the soul maintains its deathly sleep and the heart bleeds from a thousand wounds." -- Hugo Wolf]]>

	    <![CDATA["You don't become an 'artist' unless you've got something missing somewhere.  Blaise Pascal called it a God-shaped hole. Everyone's got one but some are blacker and wider than others.  It's a feeling of being abandoned,cut adrift in space and time-sometimes following the loss of a loved one.  You can never completely fill that hole-you can try with songs,family,faith and by living a full life...but when things are silent, you can still hear the hissing of what's missing." -- Bono]]>

	    <![CDATA["The most beautiful people we have known are those who have known defeat, known suffering, known struggle, known loss, and have found their way out of the depths. These persons have an appreciation, a sensitivity, and an understanding of life that fills them with compassion, gentleness, and a deep loving concern. Beautiful people do not just happen." -- Elisabeth Kübler-Ross]]>
