	    <![CDATA["The basic project of art is always to make the world whole and comprehensible, to restore it to us in all its glory and its occasional nastiness, not through argument but through feeling, and then to close the gap between you and everything that is not you, and in this way pass from feeling to meaning. It's not something that committees can do. It's not a task achieved by groups or by movements. It's done by individuals, each person mediating in some way between a sense of history and an experience of the world." -- Robert Hughes]]>

	    <![CDATA["It all began, as I have said, when the Boss, sitting in the black Cadillac which sped through the night, said to me (to Me who was what Jack Burden, the student of history, had grown up to be) &quot;There is always something.&quot;
And I said, &quot;Maybe not on the Judge.&quot;
And he said, &quot;Man is conceived in sin and born in corruption and he passeth from the stink of the didie to the stench of the shroud. There is always something." -- Robert Penn Warren]]>
