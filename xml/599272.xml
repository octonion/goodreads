	    <![CDATA["The only way you can write the truth is to assume that what you set down will never be read. Not by any other person, and not even by yourself at some later date. Otherwise you begin excusing yourself. You must see the writing as emerging like a long scroll of ink from the index finger of your right hand; you must see your left hand erasing it." -- Margaret Atwood]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Never love a wild thing, Mr. Bell,' Holly advised him. 'That was Doc's mistake. He was always lugging home wild things. A hawk with a hurt wing. One time it was a full-grown bobcat with a broken leg. But you can't give your heart to a wild thing: the more you do, the stronger they get. Until they're strong enough to run into the woods. Or fly into a tree. Then a taller tree. Then the sky. That's how you'll end up, Mr. Bell. If you let yourself love a wild thing. You'll end up looking at the sky.&quot;
&quot;She's drunk,&quot; Joe Bell informed me. 
&quot;Moderately,&quot; Holly confessed....Holly lifted her martini. &quot;Let's wish the Doc luck, too,&quot; she said, touching her glass against mine. &quot;Good luck: and believe me, dearest Doc -- it's better to look at the sky than live there. Such an empty place; so vague. Just a country where the thunder goes and things disappear." -- Truman Capote]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The male frog in mating season,&quot; said Crake, &quot;makes as much noise as it can. The females are attracted to the male frog with the biggest, deepest voice because it suggests a more powerful frog, one with superior genes. Small male frogs—it's been documented—discover if they position themselves in empty drainpipes, the pipe acts as a voice amplifier and the small frog appears much larger than it really is.&quot;
So?&quot;
So that's what art is for the artist, an empty drainpipe. An amplifier. A stab at getting laid." -- Margaret Atwood]]>
