	    <![CDATA["No, &lt;i&gt;Princes Charming,&lt;/i&gt;&quot; Duncan cheerfully corrected. &quot;'Prince' is the noun; that's what gets pluralized. 'Charming' is an adjective; you can't add an &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt; to it like that." -- Christopher Healy]]>

	    <![CDATA["Reverend Father is the only kind man I ever see. When I arrive here I believe it is the place he warns against. The freezing in hell that comes before the everlasting fire where sinners bubble and singe forever. But the ice comes first, he says. And when I see knives of it hanging from the houses and trees and feel the white air burn my face I am certain the fire is coming." -- Toni Morrison]]>

	    <![CDATA["In a way, it's nice to know that there are Greek gods out there, because you have somebody to blame when things go wrong. For instance, when you're walking away from a bus that's just been attacked by monster hags and blown up by lightning, and it's raining on top of everything else, most people might think that's just really bad luck; when you're a half-blood, you understand that some devine force is really trying to mess up your day." -- Rick Riordan]]>
