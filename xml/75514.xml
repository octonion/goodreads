And the earth with its starkness:
All these I place,
By God's almighty help and grace
Between myself and the powers of darkness!" -- Madeleine L'Engle]]>

	    <![CDATA["&lt;b&gt;Ozymandias&lt;/b&gt;

I met a traveller from an antique land
Who said: &quot;Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
Stand in the desert. Near them on the sand,
Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown
And wrinkled lip and sneer of cold command
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed.
And on the pedestal these words appear:
'My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings:
Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair!'
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare,
The lone and level sands stretch far away." -- Percy Bysshe Shelley]]>

	    <![CDATA["The Jewish sages also tell us that God dances when His children defeat Him in argument, when they stand on their feet and use their minds.  So questions like Anne's are worth asking.  To ask them is a very fine kind of human behavior.  If we keep demanding that God yield up His answers, perhaps some day we will understand them.  And then we will be something more than clever apes, and we shall dance with God." -- Mary Doria Russell]]>
