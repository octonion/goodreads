	    <![CDATA["You think I am very cute, you think me sexy, as well. I can read your thoughts, remember.” 

I hoisted myself up and slid across his body. You are conceited, arrogant, and domineering, everything I dislike in a man. 
And you are independent, stubborn, and heedless, everything I dislike in a women. 
I slid my hands under his back and kissed his dampened lips. So why is it that I love you so much? 

He smiled a smug, masculine little smile and captured my legs with his. 
Because I love you, and to be loved by a Dark One is enough for any woman.

I pinched him in a particularly vulnerable spot and allowed him to kiss me with all the sexy arrogance he had." -- Katie MacAlister]]>
