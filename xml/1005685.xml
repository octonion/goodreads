But now, my love, we are here, we are now, and those other times are running elsewhere." -- A.S. Byatt, Possession]]>

Our love has been the thread through the labyrinth, the net under the high-wire walker, the only real thing in this strange life of mine that I could ever trust.  Tonight I feel that my love for you has more density in this world than I do, myself: as though it could linger on after me and surround you, keep you, hold you." -- Audrey Niffenegger (The Time Traveler's Wife)]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Ornate language tended to unsettle him.  Passages from nineteenth-century novels might glow like hot coals or squirm like heaps of snakes.  In fact, he tried not to read anything written before the First World War.  Hemingway made a good cutoff point.  Hemingway's sentences were a nice deep blue, and they mostly held still, like stalks of wheat on a windless day.(p18)" -- Harry Dolan]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I almost let it go.  I think it was the yellow dress.  It made me want to give her the benefit of the doubt.  What can you say about a woman who wears a yellow dress to break into an office at night?  How bad can her intentions be?
Still, I was reasonably certain she wasn't telling the truth.  Not that it bothered me. Not really.  I watched her sitting there, bent slightly forward, the palm of her right hand open in her lap, her left hand rubbing her shoulder. Lips curled in a smile.  Innocent eyes looking back at me.  It was like being lied to by a basket of kittens.(p134)" -- Harry Dolan]]>

&quot;Actually, I think you can.&quot;
&quot;We'll see.  I'll call you after, let you know how it goes.  If you don't hear from me, well, you do what you think is right.  If I disappear, maybe you can find me.&quot;
Her voice had turned careless and light, but I thought I could still hear an undertone of gravity in it.
&quot;If you can't find me,&quot; she said, &quot;I wouldn't mind being avenged.(p159)" -- Harry Dolan]]>

	    <![CDATA["I find I think of myself not as a writer so much as someone who provides a gateway, a tangential route for readers to reach the circus.  To visit the circus again, if only in their minds, when they are unable to attend it physically.  I relay it through printed words on crumpled newsprint, words that they can read again and again, returning to the circus whenever they wish, regardless of time of day or physical location.  Transporting them at will.
When put that way, it sounds rather like magic, doesn't it?  p.369" -- Erin Morgenstern]]>
