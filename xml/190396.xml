		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Introverts, in contrast, may have strong social skills and enjoy parties and business meetings, but after a while wish they were home in their pajamas. They prefer to devote their social energies to close friends, colleagues, and family. They listen more than they talk, think before they speak, and often feel as if they express themselves better in writing than in conversation. They tend to dislike conflict. Many have a horror of small talk, but enjoy deep discussions." -- Susan Cain]]>

	    <![CDATA["And the Witch tempted you to do another thing, My son, did she not?”

“Yes, Aslan. She wanted me to take an apple home to mother.”

“Understand, then, that is would have healed her, but not to your joy or hers. The day would have come when both of you would have looked back and said it would have been better to die in that illness.”

And then Diggory could say nothing, for tears choked him and he gave up all hopes of saving his mother’s life; but at the same time he knew the Lion knew what would have happened, and that there might be things more terrible even than losing someone you love to death." -- C.S. Lewis]]>
