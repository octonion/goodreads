		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The king lifted a hand to her cheek and kissed her. It was not a kiss between strangers, not even a kiss between a bride and groom. It was a kiss between a man and his wife, and when it was over, the king closed his eyes and rested his forehead in the hollow of the queen's shoulder, like a man seeking respite, like a man reaching home at the end of the day." -- Megan Whalen Turner]]>

	    <![CDATA["Who am I, that you should love me?&quot;
&quot;You are My Queen,&quot; said Eugenides. She sat perfectly still, looking at him without moving as his words dropped like water into dry earth.
&quot;Do you believe me?&quot; he asked. 
&quot;Yes,&quot; she answered. 
&quot;Do you love me?&quot;
&quot;Yes.&quot;
&quot;I love you.&quot;
And she believed him." -- Megan Whalen Turner]]>

	    <![CDATA["Sophos, you sleep with a knife under your pillow? I'm hurt.&quot;
&quot;I'm sorry,&quot; said Sounis, afraid that he had made contact with his wild swing.
&quot;I was joking. Wake up the rest of the way, would you?&quot;
&quot;Gen, it's the middle of the night.&quot;
&quot;I know,&quot; said the king of Attolia.
Sounis tried to rub the sleep out of his eyes. He was sitting up in his bed. The sky was still entirely dark, and he couldn't have been asleep for long. He suspected that he had just dropped off. The bare knife was still in his hand, he realized, and he rooted under his pillow for the sheath.
&quot;Don't you trust my palace security?&quot;
&quot;Yes, of course,&quot; Sounis said, trying to think of some other reason besides mistrust to sleep with a knife. He heard Eugenides laugh.
&quot;My queen and I sleep with a matched set under our pillows, as well as handguns in pockets on the bedposts. Don't be embarrassed." -- Megan Whalen Turner]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The window opened in the same direction as the king's, and there, summer-bright and framed by the darkness of the stairwell, was the same view. Costis passed it, and then went back up the stairs to look again. There were only the roofs of the lower part of the palace and the town and the city walls. Beyond those were the hills on the far side of the Tustis Valley and the faded blue sky above them. It wasn't what the king saw that was important, it was what he couldn't see when he sat at the window with his face turned toward Eddis." -- Megan Whalen Turner]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["And this, even more wonderful and mysterious, is also true: when I read it, when I read what Julie's written, she is instantly alive again, whole and undamaged. With her words in my mind while I'm reading, she is as real as I am. Gloriously daft, drop-dead charming, full of bookish nonsense and foul language, brave and generous. She's &lt;i&gt;right here&lt;/i&gt;. Afraid and exhausted, alone, but &lt;i&gt;fighting&lt;/i&gt;. Flying in silver moonlight in a plane that can't be landed, stuck in the climbâ€”alive, alive, ALIVE." -- Elizabeth Wein]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["He just put his hand through the bulkhead, exactly as she'd done, and squeezed my shoulder. He has very strong fingers.
And he kept his hand there the whole way home, even when he was reading the map and giving me headings.
So I am not flying alone now after all." -- Elizabeth Wein]]>
