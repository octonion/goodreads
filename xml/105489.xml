	    <![CDATA["Writers shouldn't fear criticism. Instead, they should fear silence. Criticism is healthy. It gets people thinking about your work and, even better, it gets them talking and arguing. But as for silence -- it is the greatest killer of writers. So if you hate a book and want to hurt it -- don't talk about it. And if you hate my books -- please, for God's sake, shout it from the hills! " -- Robert Fanney]]>

	    <![CDATA["We must come to the Bible with the purpose of self-exposure consciously in mind.  I suspect not many people make more than a token stab in that direction.  It's extremely hard work.  It makes Bible study alternately convicting and reassuring, painful and soothing, puzzling and calming, and sometimes dull - but not for long if our purpose is to see ourselves better." -- Larry Crabb ]]>
