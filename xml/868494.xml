	    <![CDATA["Marry, don't marry,' Auntie Aya says as we unfold layers of dough to make an apple strudel.  

Just don't have your babies unless it's &lt;i&gt;absolutely necessary&lt;/i&gt;.'

How do I know if it's necessary?'

She stops and stares ahead, her hands gloved in flour.  'Ask yourself, Do I want a baby or do I want to make a cake?  The answer will come to you like bells ringing.'  She flickers her fingers in the air by her ear.  'For me, almost always, the answer was &lt;i&gt;cake&lt;/i&gt;." -- Diana Abu-Jaber]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["That said, deciding to avoid other people does not necessarily equate with having no desire whatsoever for company; it may simply reflect a dissatisfaction with what—or who—is available. Cynics are, in the end, only idealists with awkwardly high standards. In Chamfort's words, 'It is sometimes said of a man who lives alone that he does not like society. This is like saying of a man that he does not like going for walks because he is not fond of walking at night in the forêt de Bondy." -- Alain De Botton]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["There are certain children who are told they are too sensitive, and there are certain adults who believe sensitivity is a problem that can be fixed in the way that crooked teeth can be fixed and made straight. And when these two come together you get a fairytale, a kind of story with hopelessness in it.

I believe there is something in these old stories that does what singing does to words. They have transformational capabilities, in the way melody can transform mood.

They can't transform your actual situation, but they can transform your experience of it. We don't create a fantasy world to escape reality, we create it to be able to stay. I believe we have always done this, used images to stand and understand what otherwise would be intolerable." -- Lynda Barry]]>
