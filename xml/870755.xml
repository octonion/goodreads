But conversely, the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man&amp;mdash;for precisely the same reasons." -- Douglas Adams]]>

Bob Porter: Don't... don't care? 
Peter Gibbons: It's a problem of motivation, all right? Now if I work my ass off and Initech ships a few extra units, I don't see another dime; so where's the motivation? And here's something else, Bob: I have eight different bosses right now. 
Bob Slydell: I beg your pardon? 
Peter Gibbons: Eight bosses. 
Bob Slydell: Eight? 
Peter Gibbons: Eight, Bob. So that means that when I make a mistake, I have eight different people coming by to tell me about it. That's my only real motivation is not to be hassled; that, and the fear of losing my job. But you know, Bob, that will only make someone work just hard enough not to get fired. " -- Mike Judge]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["These people who expect to be saints in heaven, though they were not on Earth, have ignored the wisdom of the founders of the great religions.  This wisdom is that the kingdom of heaven is within you and that you do not go to heaven unless you are already in it.  The magic must be wrought by you and you alone.  God has no fairy wand to tap the pig and turn it into a swan.

People ignore this.  And those who believe in sinners burning in hell are, perhaps, not so much concerned with going to heaven as with being sure that sinners-–others-–roast forever in the flames." -- phillip jose farmer]]>

	    <![CDATA["A certain critic -- for such men, I regret to say, do exist -- made the nasty remark about my last novel that it contained 'all the old Wodehouse characters under different names.' He has probably by now been eaten by bears, like the children who made mock of the prophet Elisha: but if he still survives he will not be able to make a similar charge against Summer Lightning. With my superior intelligence, I have out-generalled the man this time by putting in all the old Wodehouse characters under the same names. Pretty silly it will make him feel, I rather fancy." -- P.G. Wodehouse]]>
