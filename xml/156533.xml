		<description>
	    <![CDATA["If you are bored and disgusted by politics and don't bother to vote, you are in effect voting for the entrenched Establishments of the two major parties, who please rest assured are not dumb, and who are keenly aware that it is in their interests to keep you disgusted and bored and cynical and to give you every possible reason to stay at home doing one-hitters and watching MTV on primary day.  By all means stay home if you want, but don't bullshit yourself that you're not voting.  In reality, there is &lt;i&gt;no such thing as not voting:&lt;/i&gt; you either vote by voting, or you vote by staying home and tacitly doubling the value of some Diehard's vote." -- David Foster Wallace]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Writing novels is much the same. You gather up bones and make your gate, but no matter how wonderful the gate might be, that alone doesn't make it a living breathing novel. A story is not something of this world. A real story requires a kind of magical baptism to link the world on this side with the world on the &lt;i&gt;other&lt;/i&gt; side." -- Haruki Murakami]]>

Maybe it happens all the time.  Maybe there's angry dead all over, hiding in rooms, covered with blankets, bossing around their scared, embarrassed relatives.

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["In the morning they came up out of the ravine and took to the road again. He'd carved the boy a flute from a piece of roadside cane and he took it from his coat and gave it to him. The boy took it wordlessly. After a while he fell back and after a while the man could hear him playing. A formless music for the age to come. Or perhaps the last music on earth called up from out of the ashes of its ruin. The man turned and looked back at him. He was lost in concentration. The man thought he seemed some sad and solitary changeling child announcing the arrival of a traveling spectacle in shire and village who does not know that behind him the players have all been carried off by wolves." -- Cormac McCarthy]]>

If I moved to a martial-arts monastery in China and studied real hard for ten years. If my family was wiped out by Colombian drug dealers and I swore myself to revenge. If I got a fatal disease, had one year to live, and devoted it to wiping out street crime. If I just dropped out and devoted my life to being bad." -- Neal Stephenson]]>

It turns out that designs that just work are much harder to produce that designs that assemble long lists of features." -- Douglas Crockford]]>

	    <![CDATA["The first time he had taken the massa to one of these &quot;high-falutin' to-dos,&quot; as Bell called them, Kunta had been all but overwhelmed by conflicting emotions:  awe, indignation, envy, contempt, fascination, revulsion—but most of all a deep loneliness and melancholy from which it took him almost a week to recover.  He couldn't believe that such incredible wealth actually existed, that people really lived that way.  It took him a long time, and a great many more parties, to realize that they &lt;i&gt;didn't&lt;/i&gt; live that way, that it was all strangely unreal, a kind of beautiful dream the white folks were having, a lie they were telling themselves:  that goodness can come from badness, that it's possible to be civilized with one another without treating as human beings those whose blood, sweat, and mother's milk made possible the life of privilege they led." -- Alex Haley]]>
