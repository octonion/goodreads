		<description>
	    <![CDATA["nothing which we are to perceive in this world equals 
the power of your intense fragility:whose texture 
compels me with the colour of its countries, 
rendering death and forever with each breathing 

(i do not know what it is about you that closes 
and opens;only something in me understands 
the voice of your eyes is deeper than all roses) 
nobody,not even the rain, has such small hands

-excerpt of #35 from &quot;100 Selected Poems" -- e.e. cummings]]>

	    <![CDATA["I will tell you what I will do and what I will not do.  I will not serve that in which I no longer believe, whether it calls itself my home, my fatherland, or my church: and I will try to express myself in some mode of life or art as freely as I can and as wholly as I can, using for my defense the only arms I allow myself to use -- silence, exile, and cunning." -- James Joyce]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["There are times, however, and this is one of them, when even being right feels wrong. What do you say, for instance, about a generation that has been taught that rain is poison and sex is death? If making love might be fatal and if a cool spring breeze on any summer afternoon can turn a crystal blue lake into a puddle of black poison right in front of your eyes, there is not much left except TV and relentless masturbation. It's a strange world. Some people get rich and others eat shit and die." -- Hunter S. Thompson]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["In the evening [the Iraqi interim governor of Maysan province] asked me for fifty dollars to repair his windows, which had been destroyed in a recent demonstration. Although he was the governor, his salary was only four hundred and fifty dollars a month, and Baghdad had still not agreed to give the governors an independent budget.... For the sake of a tiny sum of money - a couple thousand dollars a month from the hundred billion we had spent on the invasion - we were alienating our key partner and successor.

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Once upon a time there lived in Berlin, Germany, a man called Albinus. He was rich, respectable, happy; one day he abandoned his wife for the sake of a youthful mistress; he loved; was not loved; and his life ended in disaster.

This is the whole of the story and we might have left it at that had there not been profit and pleasure in the telling; and although there is plenty of space on a gravestone to contain, bound in moss, the abridged version of a man's life, detail is always welcome." -- Vladimir Nabokov]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Once Seung Sahn Soen-sa and a student of his attended a talk at a Zen center in California. The Dharma teacher spoke about Bodhidharma. After the talk, someone asked him &quot;What's the difference between Bodhidharma's sitting in Sorim for nine years and your sitting here now?&quot;

The Dharma teacher said, &quot;About five thousand miles.&quot;
The questioner said, &quot;Is that all?&quot;
The Dharma teacher said, &quot;Give or take a few miles.&quot;

Later on, Soen-sa asked his student, &quot;What do you think of these answers?&quot;
&quot;Not bad, not good. But the dog runs after the bone.&quot;
&quot;How would you answer?&quot;
&quot;I'd say, 'Why do you make a difference?' &quot;

Soen-sa said, &quot;Not bad. Now you ask me.&quot;
&quot;What's the difference between Bodhidharma's sitting in Sorim for nine years and your sitting here now?&quot;
&quot;Don't you know?&quot;
&quot;I'm listening.&quot;
&quot;Bodhidharma sat in Sorim for nine years. I am sitting here now.&quot;

The student smiled." -- Zen Master Seung Sahn]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["When the immense drugged universe explodes
In a cascade of unendurable colour
And leaves us gasping naked,
This is no more than the ectasy of chaos:
Hold fast, with both hands, to that royal love
Which alone, as we know certainly, restores
Fragmentation into true being.

Ecstasy of Chaos" -- Robert Graves]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Everyone I have lost 
in the closing of a door
the click of the lock

is not forgotten, they
do not die but remain
within the soft edges
of the earth, the ash

of house fires and cancer
in sin and forgiveness
huddled under old blankets

dreaming their way into
my hands, my heart
closing tight like fists.

- &quot;Indian Boy Love Song #1" -- Sherman Alexie]]>
