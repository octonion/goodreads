	    <![CDATA["To have lost is less disturbing than to wonder if we may possibly have won; and Eustacia could now, like other people at such a stage, take a standing-point outside herself, observe herself as a disinterested spectator, and think what a sport for Heaven this woman Eustacia was." -- Thomas Hardy]]>

	    <![CDATA["I’ve met God across his long walnut desk with his diplomas hanging on the wall behind him, and God asks me, “Why?”
Why did I cause so much pain?
Didn’t I realize that each of us is a sacred, unique snowflake of special unique specialness?
Can’t I see how we’re all manifestations of love?
I look at God behind his desk, taking notes on a pad, but God’s got this all wrong.
We are not special.
We are not crap or trash, either.
We just are.
We just are, and what happens just happens.
And God says, “No, that’s not right.”
Yeah. Well. Whatever. You can’t teach God anything." -- Chuck Palahniuk]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Your face, my thane, is as a book where men
May read strange matters. To beguile the time,
Look like the time; bear welcome in your eye,
Your hand, your tongue: look like the innocent flower,
But be the serpent under't. " -- William Shakespeare]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["I don't like when I can't control what reality is doing.  Which is unfortunate because reality works independently of the things I want, and I have only a limited number of ways to influence it, none of which are guaranteed to work.  I still want to keep tabs on reality, though.  Just in case it tries to do anything sneaky.  It makes me feel like I'm contributing.  The illusion of control makes the helplessness seem more palatable.  And when that illusion is taken away, I panic." -- Allie Brosh]]>

	    <![CDATA["Why are we so attached to the severities of the past? Why are we so proud of having endured our fathers and our mothers, the fireless days and the meatless days, the cold winters and the sharp tongues? It's not as if we had a choice." -- Hilary Mantel]]>
