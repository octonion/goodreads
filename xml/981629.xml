	    <![CDATA["Compassion is not a relationship between the healer and the wounded. It’s a relationship between equals. Only when we know our own darkness well can we be present with the darkness of others. Compassion becomes real when we recognize our shared humanity." -- Pema Chodron]]>

	    <![CDATA["Do you believe in spirits?  Or ghosts?...Yes, I do.  I believe in ghosts....They're the ones who haunt us.  The ones who have left us behind.&quot;

&quot;Vivian has come back to the idea that the people who matter in our lives stay with us, haunting our ordinary moments.  They're with us in the grocery store, as we turn the corner, chat with a friend.  They rise up through the pavement; we absorb them through our soles.&quot;

&quot;The things that matter stay with you, seep into your skin." -- Christina Baker Kline]]>

	    <![CDATA["Now I am in the place I call this wide wide Heaven because it includes all my simplest desires but also the most humble and grand.  The word my grandfather uses is comfort.

So there are cakes and pillows and colors galore, but underneath this more obvious patchwork quilt are places like a quiet room where you can go and hold someone's hand and not have to say anything.  Give no story.  Make no claim.  Where you can live at the edge of your skin for as long as you wish.  " -- Alice Sebold]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["On a day of burial there is no perspective--for space itself is annihilated. Your dead friend is still a fragmentary being. The day you bury him is a day of chores and crowds, of hands false or true to be shaken, of the immediate cares of mourning. The dead friend will not really die until tomorrow, when silence is round you again. Then he will show himself complete, as he was--to tear himself away, as he was, from the substantial you. Only then will you cry out because of him who is leaving and whom you cannot detain." -- Antoine de Saint-Exupéry]]>

I started looking for you, not knowing
how blind that was.

They're in each other all along." -- Mawlana Jalal-al-Din Rumi]]>
