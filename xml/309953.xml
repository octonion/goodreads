		<description>
	    <![CDATA["If you are bored and disgusted by politics and don't bother to vote, you are in effect voting for the entrenched Establishments of the two major parties, who please rest assured are not dumb, and who are keenly aware that it is in their interests to keep you disgusted and bored and cynical and to give you every possible reason to stay at home doing one-hitters and watching MTV on primary day.  By all means stay home if you want, but don't bullshit yourself that you're not voting.  In reality, there is &lt;i&gt;no such thing as not voting:&lt;/i&gt; you either vote by voting, or you vote by staying home and tacitly doubling the value of some Diehard's vote." -- David Foster Wallace]]>

	    <![CDATA["I read,&quot; I say. &quot;I study and read. I bet I've read everything you read. Don't think I haven't. I consume libraries. I wear out spines and ROM-drives. I do things like get in a taxi and say, &quot;The library, and step on it.&quot; My instincts concerning syntax and mechanics are better than your own, I can tell, with all due respect. But it transcends the mechanics. I'm not a machine. I feel and believe. I have opinions. Some of them are interesting. I could, if you'd let me, talk and talk." -- David Foster Wallace]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Both destiny's kisses and its dope-slaps illustrate an individual person's basic personal powerlessness over the really meaningful events in his life: i.e. almost nothing important that ever happens to you happens because you engineer it.  Destiny has no beeper; destiny always leans trenchcoated out of an alley with some sort of Psst that you usually can't even hear because you're in such a rush to or from something important you've tried to engineer." -- David Foster Wallace]]>

	    <![CDATA["Are we not all of us fanatics?  I say only what you of the U.S.A. pretend you do not know.  Attachments are of great seriousness.  Choose your attachments carefully.  Choose your temple of fanaticism with great care.  What you wish to sing of as tragic love is an attachment not carefully chosen.  Die for one person?  This is a craziness.  Persons change, leave, die, become ill.  They leave, lie, go mad, have sickness, betray you, die.  Your nation outlives you.  A cause outlives you." -- David Foster Wallace]]>

	    <![CDATA["Fear is unnatural.  Lightning and thunder are unnatural.  Pain, death, reality, these are all unnatural.  We can't bear these things as they are.  We know too much.  So we resort to repression, compromise and disguise.  This is how we survive the universe.  This is the natural language of the species." -- Don DeLillo]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["History was not a matter of missing minutes on the tape. I did not stand helpless before it. I hewed to the texture of collected knowledge, took faith from the solid and availing stuff of our experience. Even if we believe that history is a workwheel powered by human blood -- read the speeches of Mussolini -- at least we've known the thing together. A single narrative sweep, not ten thousand wisps of disinformation. (82)" -- Don DeLillo]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Writing is a concentrated form of thinking...a young writer sees that with words he can place himself more clearly into the world.  Words on a page, that's all it takes to help him separate himself from the forces around him, streets and people and pressures and feelings.  He learns to think about these things, to ride his own sentences into new perceptions." -- Don DeLillo]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Every time she saw a videotape of the planes she moved a finger toward the power button on the remote.  Then she kept on watching.  The second plane coming out of that ice blue sky, this was the footage that entered the body, that seemed to run beneath her skin, the fleeting sprint that carried lives and histories, theirs and hers, everyone's, into some distance, out beyond the towers." -- Don DeLillo]]>

I am every lonely railway station in every capital of Europe. I am the Street, the fanciless buildings of government. the cafe-dansant, the clockwork figure, the jazz saxophone, the tourist-lady's hairpiece, the fairy's rubber breasts, the travelling clock which always tells the wrong time and chimes in different keys. I am the dead palm tree, the Negro's dancing pumps, the dried fountain after tourist season. I am all the appurtenances of night." -- Thomas Pynchon]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["…. by the time they have reached the middle of their life’s journey, few people remember how they have managed to arrive at themselves, at their amusements, their point of view, their wife, character, occupation and successes, but they cannot help feeling that not much is likely to change anymore. It might even be asserted that they have been cheated, for one can nowhere discover any sufficient reason for everything’s coming about as it has. It might just have well as turned out differently. The events of people’s lives have, after all, only to the last degree originated in them, having generally depended on all sorts of circumstances such as the moods, the life or death of quite different people, and have, as it were, only at the given point of time come hurrying towards them" -- Robert Musil]]>

	    <![CDATA["What is perceptible to one’s mistrust is the cut-and-dried way that life is divided up and the ready-made form it assumes, the ever-recurring sameness of it, the pre-formations passed down by generation after generation, the ready-made language not only of the tongue but also of the sensations and the feelings.
