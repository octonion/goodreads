	    <![CDATA["A strange thing happened to me in my dream. I was rapt into the Seventh Heaven. There sat all the gods assembled. As a special dispensation I was granted the favor to have one wish. &quot;Do you wish for youth,&quot; said Mercury, &quot;or for beauty, or power, or a long life; or do you wish for the most beautiful woman, or any other of the many fine things we have in our treasure trove? Choose, but only one thing!&quot; For a moment I was at a loss. Then I addressed the gods in this wise: &quot;Most honorable contemporaries, I choose one thing — that I may always have the laughs on my side.&quot; Not one god made answer, but all began to laugh. From this I concluded that my wish had been granted and thought that the gods knew how to express themselves with good taste: for it would surely have been inappropriate to answer gravely: your wish has been granted." -- Soren Kierkegaard]]>

	    <![CDATA["Of all ridiculous things the most ridiculous seems to me, to be busy — to be a man who is brisk about his food and his work. Therefore, whenever I see a fly settling, in the decisive moment, on the nose of such a person of affairs; or if he is spattered with mud from a carriage which drives past him in still greater haste; or the drawbridge opens up before him; or a tile falls down and knocks him dead, then I laugh heartily." -- Søren Kierkegaard]]>

	    <![CDATA["[The doctor] peeked into the trauma room and saw the situation: the clerk - that is, me - standing next to the orderly, Georgie, both of us on drugs, looking down at a patient with a knife sticking up out of his face. 

'What seems to be the trouble?' he asked." -- Denis Johnson]]>
