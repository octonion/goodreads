		<description>
	    <![CDATA["There are infinite numbers between 0 and 1. There's .1 and .12 and .112 and an infinite collection of others. Of course, there is a bigger infinite set of numbers between 0 and 2, or between 0 and a million. Some infinities are bigger than other infinities. A writer we used to like taught us that. There are days, many of them, when I resent the size of my unbounded set. I want more numbers than I'm likely to get, and God, I want more numbers for Augustus Waters than he got. But, Gus, my love, I cannot tell you how thankful I am for our little infinity. I wouldn't trade it for the world. You gave me a forever within the numbered days, and I'm grateful." -- John Green]]>

I smiled.  &quot;Sure.&quot;

&quot;Tomorrow?&quot; he asked.

&quot;Patience, grasshopper,&quot; I counseled.  &quot;You don't want to seem overeager.  

&quot;Right, that's why I said tomorrow,&quot; he said.  &quot;I want to see you again tonight.  But I'm willing to wait all night and much of tomorrow.&quot;  I rolled my eyes.  &quot;I'm serious,&quot; he said.  

&quot;You don't even know me,&quot; I said.  I grabbed the book from the center console.  &quot;How about I call you when I finish this?&quot;

&quot;But you don't even have my phone number,&quot; he said.

&quot;I strongly suspect you wrote it in this book.&quot; 

He broke out into that goofy smile.  &quot;And you say we don't know each other." -- John Green]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Augustus Waters was a self-aggrandizing bastard. But we forgive him. We forgive him not because he had  a heart as figuratively good as his literal one sucked, or because he knew more about how to hold a cigarette than any nonsmoker in history, or because he got eighteen years when he should've gotten more.'
'Seventeen,' Gus corrected.
'I'm assuming you've got some time, you interupting bastard.
'I'm telling you,' Isaac continued, 'Augustus Waters talked so much that he'd interupt you at his own funeral. And he was pretentious: Sweet Jesus Christ, that kid never took a piss without pondering the abundant metaphorical resonances of human waste production. And he was vain: I do not believe I have ever met a more physically attractive person who was more acutely aware of his own physical attractiveness.
'But I will say this: When the scientists of the future show up at my house with robot eyes and they tell me to try them on, I will tell the scientists to screw off, because I do not want to see a world without him.'
I was kind of crying by then." -- John Green]]>

	    <![CDATA["Much of my life had been devoted to trying not to cry in front of people who loved me, so I knew what Augustus was doing.  You clench your teeth.  You look up.  You tell yourself that if they see you cry, it will hurt them, and you will be nothing but a Sadness in their lives, and you must not become a mere sadness, so you will not cry, and you say all of this to yourself while looking up at the ceiling, and then you swallow even though your throat does not want to close and you look at the person who loves you and smile." -- John Green]]>

I'm in love with you, and I know that love is just a shout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that we're all doomed and that there will come a day when all our labor has been returned to dust, and I know the sun will swallow the only earth we'll ever have, and I am in love with you." -- John Green]]>

&quot;Right, of course. But you keep the promise anyway. That's what love is. Love is keeping the promise anyway." -- John Green]]>

	    <![CDATA["There will come a time when all of us are dead.  All of us.  There will come a time when there are no human beings remaining to remember that anyone ever existed or that our species ever did anything.  There will be no one left to remember Aristotle or Cleopatra, let alone you.  Everything that we did and built and wrote and thought and discovered will be forgotten and all of this will have been for naught.  Maybe that time is coming soon and maybe it is millions of years away, but even if we survive the collapse of our sun, we will not survive forever.  There was time before organisms experienced consciousness, and there will be time after.  And if the inevitability of human oblivion worries you, I encourage you to ignore it.  God knows that’s what everyone else does." -- John Green]]>
