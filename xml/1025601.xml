	    <![CDATA["If I know a song of Africa, of the giraffe and the African new moon lying on her back, of the plows in the fields and the sweaty faces of the coffee pickers, does Africa know a song of me? Will the air over the plain quiver with a color that I have had on, or the children invent a game in which my name is, or the full moon throw a shadow over the gravel of the drive that was like me, or will the eagles of the Ngong Hills look out for me?" -- Isak Dinesen]]>

	    <![CDATA["If it be love indeed, tell me how much.
There’s beggary in the love that can be reckon’d.
I’ll set a bourn how far to be belov’d.
Then must thou needs find out new heaven, new earth.&quot;

Antony and Cleopatra  - Act 1, Scene 1" -- William Shakespeare]]>
