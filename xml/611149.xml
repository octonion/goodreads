		<description>
	    <![CDATA["Someone had cleared that hillside once to make an orchard that had fallen into ruin and was now only twisted silver branches and split trunks. I sat there and continued to watch the sky as, out of nowhere, great solid-looking clouds built hot stacks and cotton cones. I was sixteen years old." -- Louise Erdrich]]>

		</link>
		<description>
	    <![CDATA["We were growing up. It was one of those moments when you could practically feel the adult pushing out, pushing forward into the world. Perspective suddenly existed where it hadn't existed before. This was just the beginning of our lives—our lives, things that we were responsible for, things that we could control. It seemed all at once too big and too simple an idea." -- Hannah Pittard]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The neighborhood had gotten really into pastel the last few years. It started when Alfred's wife painted their whole house a soft pink during menopause. Looks Like Linen it was called. People raved. A magazine came, made the family hold up a rotisserie chicken, and then photographed it. A few months later, Mrs. Trenton's house was Mint Leaf. Ours became Celery Powder. The Resnicks' house turned Yellow Feather." -- Alison Espach]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["The moment you killed something – a living creature or a false hope – was the moment you came of age. Loss of innocence wasn’t a passive experience that happened &lt;i&gt;to&lt;/i&gt; you. It was something you gave up." -- Jennifer Miller]]>
