	    <![CDATA["I wanted you to see what real courage is, instead of getting the idea that courage is a man with a gun in his hand. It's when you know you're licked before you begin, but you begin anyway and see it through no matter what.
- Atticus Finch" -- Harper Lee]]>

	    <![CDATA["O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo? 
Deny thy father refuse thy name, thou art thyself thou not a montegue, what is montegue? tis nor hand nor foot nor any other part belonging to a man 
What is in a name? 
That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet, 
So Romeo would were he not Romeo called retain such dear perfection to which he owes without that title, 
Romeo, Doth thy name! 
And for that name which is no part of thee, take all thyself." -- William Shakespeare]]>

	    <![CDATA["All the world's a stage, 
And all the men and women merely players; 
They have their exits and their entrances; 
And one man in his time plays many parts, 
His acts being seven ages." -- William Shakespeare]]>

	    <![CDATA["I am a Jew. Hath not a Jew eyes? Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions; fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject to the same diseases, 
heal'd by the same means, warm'd and cool'd by the same winter and summer, as a Christian is? 

If you prick us, do we not bleed? If 
you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? 

And if you wrong us, do we not revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will resemble you in that." -- William Shakespeare]]>
