	    <![CDATA["Virginia Woolf wrote, &quot;Across the broad continent of a woman's life falls the shadow of a sword.&quot; On one side of that sword, she said, there lies convention and tradition and order, where all is correct.  But on the other side of that sword, if you're crazy enough to cross it and choose a life that does not follow convention, &quot;all is confusion.&quot;  Nothing follows a regular course.  Her argument was that the crossing of the shadow of that sword may bring a more interesting existence to a woman, but you can bet it will be more perilous." -- Elizabeth Gilbert]]>

		<description>
	    <![CDATA["When your eyes are tired the world is tired also. When your vision has gone no part of the world can find you. Time to go into the dark where the night has eyes to recognize its own. There you can be sure you are not beyond love. The dark will be your womb tonight. The night will give you a horizon further than you can see. You must learn one thing. The world was made to be free in. Give up on all other worlds except the one to which you belong. Sometimes it takes darkness and the sweet confinement of your aloneness to learn anything or anyone that does not bring you alive is too small for you. " -- David Whyte]]>
