Where was I?&quot;

The bubonic plague. The bulldozer was stalled by corpses.&quot;

Oh, yes. Anyway, one sleepless night I stayed up with Father while he worked. It was all we could do to find a live patient to treat. In bed after bed after bed we found dead people.

And Father started giggling,&quot; Castle continued.

He couldn't stop. He walked out into the night with his flashlight. He was still giggling. He was making the flashlight beam dance over all the dead people stacked outside. He put his hand on my head and do you know what that marvelous man said to me?&quot; asked Castle.

Nope.&quot;

'Son,' my father said to me, 'someday this will all be yours." -- Kurt Vonnegut]]>
