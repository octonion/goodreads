	    <![CDATA["Finish each day and be done with it. You have done what you could.  Some blunders and absurdities no doubt crept in; forget them as soon as you can. Tomorrow is a new day.  You shall begin it serenely and with too high a spirit to be encumbered with your old nonsense." -- Ralph Waldo Emerson]]>

	    <![CDATA["Conversation between a princess and an outlaw: 
&quot;If I stand for fairy-tale balls and dragon bait--dragon bait--what do you stand for?&quot;
&quot;Me? I stand for uncertainty, insecurity, bad taste, fun, and things that go boom in the night.&quot;
&quot;Franky, it seems to me that you've turned yourself into a stereotype.&quot;
&quot;You may be right. I don't care. As any car freak will tell you, the old models are the most beautiful, even if they aren't the most efficient. People who sacrifice beauty for efficiency get what they deserve.&quot;
&quot;Well, you may get off on being a beautiful stereotype, regardless of the social consequences, but my conscience won't allow it.&quot; 
&quot;And I goddamn refuse to be dragon bait. I'm as capable of rescuing you as you are of rescuing me.&quot;
&quot;I'm an outlaw, not a hero. I never intended to rescue you. We're our own dragons as well as our own heroes, and we have to rescue ourselves from ourselves." -- Tom Robbins]]>
